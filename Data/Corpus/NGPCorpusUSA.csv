Arroyo Village,"Big Impact with a Small Footprint Freddie Martin, a student of history and anthropology, talks to me outside his home in Denver on a cloudy day in December. He s a formidable character who grew up in Beaumont, Texas with strong viewpoints on the state of politics in our country. He shares some of his writing with me just outside House 6, his home at the Beloved Community Village. I ve been through quite a bit in my time, says Martin. I ve been housing insecure for over a decade. Martin has been a Villager since March 2018, after meeting Cilla Wolf, a former Beloved Community Village resident, on the campus of Metro State University. Being here has given him the chance to finish his degrees. The Colorado Village Collaborative exists to create and operate transformational housing communities for people exiting homelessness and entering housing. The fight for decriminalization of homelessness and finding housing solutions has been a long one in Denver. Like Charlotte, the city has seen rapid growth over the past two decades. The median home value has risen from 222,550 to 409,900 in the past 10 years. Average rent for a one bedroom apartment is 1,423 a month. To afford an apartment within 10 miles of metro Denver, an individual making minimum wage salary, which is 11.10/hour, four dollars more than that of North Carolina, must work 130 hours a week, four weeks a month. People are regularly pushed out of areas as gentrification sweeps in leaving limited affordable housing options close to jobs, food and services. Denver Homeless Out Loud started building tiny homes in 2013 following the passage of an Unauthorized Camping Ban ordinance which made it illegal for those experiencing homelessness to sleep on public property. When the group organized the voices of those living on the streets, one of the ideas that quickly popped up was the idea of creating a tiny home village. It was something people on the street specifically wanted, says Cole Chandler. We didn t dream this up in a lab somewhere. Chandler, who cites his faith as a leading factor in his work, is a community organizer and serves as the co director of the Colorado Village Collaborative. (Note: In December, the U. S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case in which the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a camping ban in Boise, Idaho, and citing that case, a Denver County judge ruled that the city s urban camping ban is unconstitutional, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment. ) In 2015, Denver Homeless Out Loud staged a direct action in Sustainability Park, a historic low income housing space that sat vacant for over 20 years after housing was torn down by the city. They quickly set up 10 tiny homes. Within 12 hours, police raided the area, arresting 10 people and destroying the site. In 2016, the Alternative Solutions Advocacy Project, a broader coalition, was created under the leadership of the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado. We started to get some traction, says Chandler. The coalition brought together advocates, service providers, people on the street, academics, the faith community and business leaders. The Urban Land Conservancy offered a piece of land and the Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) was formed. In July 2017, Beloved Community Village, the city s first tiny home community, opened with its first 11 homes built through grassroots organizing and over 400 volunteers. The city s zoning and permitting laws created barriers for the project. Most of the city is restricted to single unit or two unit zoning, and the tiny homes at Beloved Community Village don t have running water or sewer, preventing them from existing under standard building codes. It s not what the city would consider a dwelling unit, says Chandler. The 8 by 12 foot dormitory style units were built in a hub and spoke community design with a central shower facility. The village currently uses portable toilets and is building a new community building that will provide lockers, private bathrooms with showers, a kitchen and eating area. A widely accepted industry definition identifies a tiny house as a dwelling that is 500 square feet or less and they ve been made popular by HGTV, while providing options for affordable housing throughout the country. Beloved Community Village is adding another nine units, bringing the project to a total of 20 homes. The village and infrastructure costs approximately 600,000 in the city of Denver, much more affordable than a traditional shelter. According to Aldo s Restoration and Construction in Charlotte, a local tiny home builder, the average price of a tiny home is 25,000, approximately 10 times cheaper than the average price of building a typical home. In 2018, Charlotte City Council weighed the options for tiny houses prompted by the proposed Keyo Park West development in the Coulwood neighborhood. According to the Charlotte Business Journal, the project, which later fell through and resulted in several lawsuits, prompted a discussion by city planning staff about how tiny homes would fit within current local and state building and zoning codes, including whether a new overlay district for neighborhood conservation would be pursued a motion that ultimately was tabled. In a Transportation Planning Committee meeting on Feb. 19, 2018, Charlotte City Council Member Tariq Bakhari (District 6) stated So the crux of the decision of this Committee and ultimately the full Council needs to come to is do we want to change anything that would prohibit or put some requirements around this, and I assume that would lead to what are the reasons why? Obviously affordable house (sic) is a big deal, and this seems like a very innovative solution for it. In what scenarios of affordable housing may we want to make this easier to do? The Beloved Community Village was made possible by an ordinance passed by Denver City Council, carving out a space in the city s existing zoning and building codes. The update allowed for tiny home village permits that last up to 180 days, with a chance for renewal. Leadership in Community Planning Development believed in the vision and was really willing to work to figure out a solution to make this viable, says Polly Kyle, senior aide for Denver City Councilwoman Robin Kniech. In Denver, Chandler, Kniech and others sought ways to activate vacant city land or land that was already scheduled for development. Both land acquisition and land availability were cited challenges in a 2016 Charlotte Mecklenburg Strategies for Affordable Housing Development report. Land acquisition costs were cited as one of the largest barriers for building affordable housing especially in higher income communities and along transit corridors. It can also be complicated to find opportunity for multifamily properties in neighborhoods traditionally zoned for single family. Eight four percent of residential land in Charlotte is zoned for single family homes, but there s growing momentum that could bring changes allowing for more options in the city s traditional neighborhoods. The tiny homes at Beloved Community Village are built on jack stands, previously cement foundation blocks, so they are easy to move. Vacant land that has been cleared for future development provides an opportunity to utilize the land while necessary planning and permitting is completed. The former site of CVC s first project was developed into a 16 story market rate apartment building causing them to move to its current location in Globeville, which is leased by the city to CVC for 10 a year. According to Kyle, the city s Housing an Inclusive Denver plan is working to build and preserve affordable housing, and the city continues to look at group living ordinances to allow for more options. A vocal supporter of the project, Councilwoman Kniech pushed forward for a legal path for villages to expand and get services, pulling temporary tiny homes out of the group living process and passing a new ordinance in October 2019 that would expedite the process. In the last budget cycle, they secured an additional 125,000 in the city budget to connect villagers to permanent housing. Intentional Community The first year of Beloved Community Village was a success for residents and neighbors alike, despite initial community pushback. According to the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, The Village had no negative impacts on the neighborhood and people who live in the village are more stable. Daniel Brisson, from Denver University Graduate School of Social Work, describes it as intentional community. The Village is built around the concept of shared governance where residents decide who moves in and create rules for the community. In doing so, residents build relationships and skills around a consensus model. Dorothy Leyba is a Village Organizer for CVC and provides individual support to villagers while building community outside the village. She sees how the setup helps build advocacy, personal pride and leadership skills within the village. Residents must follow six basic community agreements: 1. No violence. 2. No weapons. 3. No illegal drugs. 4. No discriminatory behavior. 5. No continuously disruptive behavior. 6. Participation in community. During the first year, five villagers moved out three into permanent housing and two being expelled for violating the agreements. While touring the Beloved Community Village, villagers go about their daily chores. One villager meets with a case manager while sounds of construction on the new community house and additional tiny homes roars ahead. Villagers regularly go in and out of each other s homes, connecting with each other and truly living as a family unit. This is one of the most diverse communities that you ll see, says Chandler. People don t generally opt into diversity. Of the 22 residents we ve had, three have been transgender and a significant portion of the population have been people of color. It s people of all ages, people from all over the country and all education levels, too. That s not what a typical neighborhood looks like. One in five transgender people in the United States has been discriminated against when seeking a home, and more than one in 10 have been evicted from their homes because of their gender identity. Homelessness is a critical issue with one in five transgender people experiencing homelessness at some point in their lives, in large part because of familial or employment discrimination. One of the community partners of CVC is the Delores Project, which houses adult women and transgender people that are facing homelessness. The shelter is part of a larger project in partnership with the affordable housing developer Rocky Mountain Communities, which together own and operate an entire city block built with Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Arroyo Village. The block includes the shelter as well as 35 units of low income permanent supportive housing and 95 units of affordable housing for individuals and families in the workforce. The space is specifically designed for people with trauma history in mind, with large southern facing windows, plants, wood features, and soothing colors and textiles. Delores Project offers case management, life skills training, housing stability programming and emergency beds for people being released from incarceration. The goal is to move people from homelessness to stable housing. Within their first two visits, they re writing up a housing plan, says Emily Wheeland, program director at Delores Project. Former Beloved Community Village resident Silla Wolfe interviewed in The Right to Rest, a film by Sarah Megyesy and Guillermo Roques. Wolfe is one of 3 transgender residents to have lived at Beloved Community Village The area around the Delores Project is quickly gentrifying and it is the only overnight shelter in the city that is open and celebratory of transgender individuals, serving anyone that identifies along the transgender spectrum and including features like single use restrooms, private shower stalls and changing facilities. About 10 percent of the people we see self identify as trans, says Wheeland. We see a lot of folks that come from other states that we re the nearest big city to the west, that are coming from smaller towns or states that might not be as trans friendly as Denver is. A Place To Call Home I understand what it s like for people to have something they can call their own to have a key, and to have that security and that sense of empowerment, really means a lot to people, says Freddie Martin. It really makes a big difference. I never really felt like a real part of a community before. People here are amazingly open and caring and honest. The people here have been through things. They understand what suffering is. I ve always had people in my life that don t necessarily understand suffering, so it s hard for them to contend with people who are suffering, but that s one of the wonderful things about this place. People have been through things, and they re grateful for what they have. In theory, Beloved Community Village can be a unique stepping stone for people utilizing shelter services at places like the Delores Project before moving on to more permanent housing, be it shared apartments or affordable housing. We have a lot to learn about how to make this the most successful place it can be, says Chandler. This is a different emergent kind of thing. This is not a silver bullet. This is what happens when a community comes together to address a big problem. One of the things that came out of that first study was we took a vacant lot that was right across the street from a light rail station a place with a lot of activity and no eyes on the street says Chandler discussing a study by the Denver University s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. We put the village there, and crime actually decreased in the direct blocks surrounding it. That s not something that people expect, but activating a vacant lot is a valuable thing. I see the potential of this village. I want to see it expand. I want to see more villages. It s not permanent housing, but it is a stepping stone for our villagers to get permanent housing. Colorado Village Collaborative is working on creating a transgender inclusive women s village and will start a community engagement plan to find the right site this year. They would like to build 15 additional homes with a shared community space like the new one being constructed at Beloved Community. Chandler brings up the idea of tiny home villages in every city council district across Denver. On a consistent basis, the city has around 600 people living in unsheltered homelessness on any given night. Could we essentially achieve a functional zero in terms of that population by offering a humane solution that is scattered around the city. Wheeland from the Delores Project talks about changing the entire philosophy of serving those who face homelessness. By providing housing first and then continuing services like community support, mental health and life skills training after they have some type of housing stability will allow for greater impact in the community. The ultimate goal is housing, right? So, the pathway sometimes does look like they re going into a tiny home for two years. They re going into some transitional housing, before they re moving into permanent housing. It just starts by building relationships and seeing people that are struggling as our neighbors and as our family, and finding that compassion in our hearts, says Chandler. This is a seed of what the world could be.

Mark Antonation click to enlarge Chef Dave Hadley started his own samosa company in 2020, and 2021 could lead to expansion. Mark Antonation Now that we've put 2020 to bed (too bad we couldn't smother it with a pillow), it's time to start thinking about brighter days ahead. Things will still be tough for the restaurant industry in 2021, since the rollout of vaccinations will be slow and large gatherings will likely be limited for at least the first half of the new year. But warmer weather and relaxed COVID restrictions should get Denver diners out of their hibernation dens and back onto patios and into restaurant dining rooms by summer. The dining rooms that have survived the pandemic, that is. In order to survive, restaurants will still have to work hard and do plenty of rejiggering of old business models to take a post COVID economy into account. But in the meantime, the news that dining rooms can reopen on a limited level in metro Denver got the year off to a brighter start than it might have had otherwise maybe the annual January to March restaurant doldrums won't seem quite as bad this year. Here are five other predictions for Denver's food and restaurant scene for 2021:While many people will continue to feel apprehensive about sharing indoor space with strangers, Coloradans have proven willing to take dining outdoors. Last summer saw a proliferation of outdoor markets, pop ups and food truck gatherings in previously untapped locations, and the trend should only increase with a sunny spring. Last fall, newcomer Oh Golly Dumplings sprang up at multiple locations, including the Alley at the Dairy Block, Pony Up and the Way Back, and in Aurora, the Esquina Del Sabor food truck group at the corner of Chambers Road and East Colfax Avenue added a wide variety of Latin American eats. Night Market was a favorite, too, serving street food and peddling locally made products at Fort Greene in Globeville and other locations. Look for more unique and innovative offerings at farmers' markets, bars, suburban rec centers, plazas and other public spaces in 2021. And keep an eye out for brick and mortar eateries cooking on their patios, adding walk up windows and spilling out into the streets. Sadly, scores of vacant restaurant spaces sit unused because so many businesses shuttered in 2020, while other empty spots from previous years' eatery closings went unclaimed. The result is a big inventory of available space for rent, and the Denver restaurant scene abhors a vacuum. As the economy improves, young and energetic chefs and restaurateurs will jump in, many of them hungry for work after months of being unemployed. But money will be tight, so we may not see the gleaming finishes and high end furnishings that have marked lavish openings over the past several years. Instead, look back to the Great Recession of 2009 and 2010, when entrepreneurs built their dreams from reclaimed materials, beetle kill pine and elbow grease. And rather than indulge in flights of fancy, kitchens will turn out the foods that make us feel warm and safe but aren't necessarily easy to replicate at home. Will that lead to more fried chicken, pizza and burritos? Probably, but creative thinkers will breathe new life into familiar foods like Danger Zone Calzones , which converted a Broadway storefront into an homage toThe calzone specialist opened its doors today, January 4, giving us fun and entertaining things to look forward to in its new location at 32 Broadway, while continuing to schedule appearances with the Danger Zone food truck. Many vacant restaurant spaces are in the suburbs, where rent is cheaper and immigrant communities have settled. That's where you'll already find great food from all over the world, but more international eateries will open in 2021 as recent arrivals from Southeast Asia, Africa and China look to feed their communities while offering something new in the city. Portico Eritrean and Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar recently opened at 1050 South Havana in Aurora, in the former home of El Jaripeo. Look for more like this in the coming months. Many chefs and other professionals in or adjacent to the restaurant industry found themselves out of work in 2020 but rather than give up, they started their own businesses making food from cottage kitchens and commissaries. One of the first was Pandemic Donuts , which began life as a delivery only doughnut bakery last April and is now in the process of moving in with Queen City Coffee Collective in Five Points. KREAM Kimchi started out as a project to hand deliver free kimchi to friends of founder Virgil Dickerson and is now a going concern that has grown by leaps and bounds. Chefs Eric Chiappetta and Dave Hadley launched Minga Provisions and the Samosa Shop , respectively, and pasta delivery companies such as Fantasioso Foods and Casa Crobu also debuted, giving folks stuck at home ready to cook alternatives to takeout food. Will we find some of these products on grocery store shelves in 2021? It would be great to see more locally made food products next to national brands. The State of Colorado's color coded COVID dial doesn't leave much room for watering holes that don't serve food or haven't found a way to partner with food trucks, neighboring restaurants or other food producers. Bars with no form of food service can't open under current Level Red or Orange restrictions, and even as we slide into Yellow and Blue, they will not be able to open. It's not until we hit Level Green (or Protect Our Neighbors, the lightest level of restrictions) that bars can reopen at 50 percent capacity. Why? ""We don't want Colorado to become a mecca of nightlife in the pandemic,"" said Governor Jared Polis back in June. And while some of us are perfectly content sipping whiskey sodas solo in a half empty dive bar, most drinking establishments exist for the purpose of socializing and socializing will be one of the last milestones of a return to normal.

Army Corps of Engineers is repairing sections of the Cherry Creek Spillway in Aurora near South Chambers Road and Yale Avenue. A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers said the plan is to restore the spillway to its original design without impacting existing infrastructure or utilities. According to the government agency, over the past 60 years, the spillway side slopes have deposited up to 14 feet of sediment in the 11,600 foot long spillway. Maintenance crews will excavate 220,000 cubic yards of sediment and that material will be placed on Corps land right next to the spillway. So far, crews have completed the downstream and upstream sections and are currently working on the main center section. The center section earthwork is expected to be complete this spring, but crews have until September 2021 to complete the work.

Bars with no form of food service can't open under current Level Red or Orange restrictions, and even as we slide into Yellow and Blue, they will not be able to open. It's not until we hit Level Green (or Protect Our Neighbors, the lightest level of restrictions) that bars can reopen at 50 percent capacity. Why? ""We don't want Colorado to become a mecca of nightlife in the pandemic,"" said Governor Jared Polis back in June. And while some of us are perfectly content sipping whiskey sodas solo in a half empty dive bar, most drinking establishments exist for the purpose of socializing and socializing will be one of the last milestones of a return to normal.  No charges for Aurora officers who handcuffed Black family after mistaking their SUV as stolen AURORA, Colo. No charges are being filed against Aurora police officers who in August handcuffed a Black family after mistaking their vehicle as stolen, though prosecutors called the incident ""very concerning"" and called on police to investigate why the officers weren't trained better. The 18th Judicial District Attorney's Office announced the decision Friday morning. The incident happened Aug. 2 and involved Aurora officers Darian Dasko and Madison Moen. Dasko and Moen stopped the family's Dodge SUV near South Chambers Road and East Iliff Avenue, believing it was a reported stolen vehicle. The stolen vehicle report turned out to be from a motorcycle in Montana, not the family's SUV. The officers drew their guns and ordered the family including several children, the youngest of whom was five to lay face down on the pavement, according to the district attorney's review of the case. No one in the car had committed a crime ""or did anything to warrant being contacted by APD,"" the prosecutors' review said. The family, prosecutors found, was ""blameless"" in the incident. Still, prosecutors determined there was not evidence that the two Aurora officers acted ""unlawfully, intentionally, knowingly or negligently"" during the incident. Prosecutors acknowledged that what happened to the family was ""unacceptable and preventable"" but the incident wasn't enough to charge the officers. Read the full review from the district attorney's office here Dasko and Moen, who had graduated from the Aurora Police Academy two days prior, were riding together in a marked patrol car when they saw on their in car computer that a blue Dodge Journey SUV had been reported in the area. When Moen spotted the SUV in a parking lot off East Iliff, they confirmed it matched the license plate of the reported stolen vehicle. Dasko saw the SUV had tinted windows and radioed to dispatch that he and Moen would be conducting a ""high risk"" traffic stop. The officers ordered the family out of the car, and the driver responded, ""I've got a car full of kids! Are you kidding me?"" Dasko told the driver, ""You're in a stolen vehicle,"" and then said, ""Just cooperate and this will all go smoothly. This is a stolen vehicle. "" The drive tried to explain that the vehicle had been stolen in the past but was found and returned. Dasko still ordered the family out of the car and onto the ground. Then another passenger emerged from the SUV, according to the prosecutors' review, a five year old girl ""wearing a pink crown. "" The young girl joined her family on the pavement, where they were held at gunpoint by the officers. The driver again told Dasko the vehicle wasn't stolen, and Dasko said, ""It's okay. "" ""It's not okay!"" the driver told the officer, and four of the children ""began to sob,"" the prosecutors' review said. Dasko and Moen then handcuffed the driver and checked with dispatch again to confirm the vehicle was stolen. Dispatch informed the officers that the stolen vehicle plate actually came back to a motorcycle in Montana and was clear in Colorado. Still, Dasko put the handcuffed driver in the back of his patrol car as he sorted out the situation. Moen then handcuffed two of the older girls from the family. Other officers had arrived at the scene, and one held a handgun at a ""low ready"" position, pointed at the ground, the prosecutors' review said. At this point, the girls began crying and saying they didn't want to go to jail. Police took the handcuffs off the girls about nine minutes into the incident, the review said. In the patrol car, Dasko acknowledged to the SUV's driver that the situation was ""wrong"" and that he would ""make it right,"" saying there was a mistake in their stolen vehicle report system. But the woman remained handcuffed, and Dasko said he needed to talk to his sergeant. Dasko soon took the handcuffs off the driver. According to the prosecutors' review, the driver and the children were handcuffed for about 8 1/2 minutes. Prosecutors concluded that, despite the inaccurate information initially given to Dasko about the stolen vehicle, ""he had no reasonable way to know that at the time he initiated his stop of the vehicle. "" ""Officer Dasko had probable cause to believe the vehicle was stolen at the time he stopped it,"" prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors said it appeared from body cam footage that Dasko and Moen ""strictly adhered to their training"" during the incident. ""This is not to say that what happened to the occupants of the vehicle is okay or tolerable,"" prosecutors wrote. ""It is not. The errors in information sharing, training, and procedure that led to these innocent people being subjected to this police encounter must be investigated further and prevented from happening again. Those are issues that do not appear to rise to the level of criminal culpability and are outside the jurisdiction of our office. "" Clinton McKinzie, the chief deputy district attorney, wrote the review for the 18th Judicial District Attorney's Office. Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson had apologized to the family shortly after the incident happened. ""We have been training our officers that when they contact a suspected stolen car, they should do what is called a high risk stop,"" Wilson said in a statement in August. ""This involves drawing their weapons and ordering all occupants to exit the car and lie prone on the ground. But we must allow our officers to have discretion and to deviate from this process when different scenarios present themselves. I have already directed my team to look at new practices and training. I have called the family to apologize and to offer any help we can provide, especially for the children who may have been traumatized by yesterday's events. I have reached out to our victim advocates so we can offer age appropriate therapy that the city will cover.

South Havana,"Here's What 2021 Could Bring to the Denver Dining Scene click to enlarge Street Food will be big in 2021, including La Esquina Del Sabor in Aurora. Mark Antonation click to enlarge Havana Street is a great place to find new restaurants, such as Portico or Seoul Mandoo, which made these dumplings. Mark Antonation click to enlarge Chef Dave Hadley started his own samosa company in 2020, and 2021 could lead to expansion. Mark Antonation Now that we've put 2020 to bed (too bad we couldn't smother it with a pillow), it's time to start thinking about brighter days ahead. Things will still be tough for the restaurant industry in 2021, since the rollout of vaccinations will be slow and large gatherings will likely be limited for at least the first half of the new year. But warmer weather and relaxed COVID restrictions should get Denver diners out of their hibernation dens and back onto patios and into restaurant dining rooms by summer. The dining rooms that have survived the pandemic, that is. In order to survive, restaurants will still have to work hard and do plenty of rejiggering of old business models to take a post COVID economy into account. But in the meantime, the news that dining rooms can reopen on a limited level in metro Denver got the year off to a brighter start than it might have had otherwise maybe the annual January to March restaurant doldrums won't seem quite as bad this year. Here are five other predictions for Denver's food and restaurant scene for 2021:While many people will continue to feel apprehensive about sharing indoor space with strangers, Coloradans have proven willing to take dining outdoors. Last summer saw a proliferation of outdoor markets, pop ups and food truck gatherings in previously untapped locations, and the trend should only increase with a sunny spring. Last fall, newcomer Oh Golly Dumplings sprang up at multiple locations, including the Alley at the Dairy Block, Pony Up and the Way Back, and in Aurora, the Esquina Del Sabor food truck group at the corner of Chambers Road and East Colfax Avenue added a wide variety of Latin American eats. Night Market was a favorite, too, serving street food and peddling locally made products at Fort Greene in Globeville and other locations. Look for more unique and innovative offerings at farmers' markets, bars, suburban rec centers, plazas and other public spaces in 2021. And keep an eye out for brick and mortar eateries cooking on their patios, adding walk up windows and spilling out into the streets. Sadly, scores of vacant restaurant spaces sit unused because so many businesses shuttered in 2020, while other empty spots from previous years' eatery closings went unclaimed. The result is a big inventory of available space for rent, and the Denver restaurant scene abhors a vacuum. As the economy improves, young and energetic chefs and restaurateurs will jump in, many of them hungry for work after months of being unemployed. But money will be tight, so we may not see the gleaming finishes and high end furnishings that have marked lavish openings over the past several years. Instead, look back to the Great Recession of 2009 and 2010, when entrepreneurs built their dreams from reclaimed materials, beetle kill pine and elbow grease. And rather than indulge in flights of fancy, kitchens will turn out the foods that make us feel warm and safe but aren't necessarily easy to replicate at home. Will that lead to more fried chicken, pizza and burritos? Probably, but creative thinkers will breathe new life into familiar foods like Danger Zone Calzones , which converted a Broadway storefront into an homage toThe calzone specialist opened its doors today, January 4, giving us fun and entertaining things to look forward to in its new location at 32 Broadway, while continuing to schedule appearances with the Danger Zone food truck. Many vacant restaurant spaces are in the suburbs, where rent is cheaper and immigrant communities have settled. That's where you'll already find great food from all over the world, but more international eateries will open in 2021 as recent arrivals from Southeast Asia, Africa and China look to feed their communities while offering something new in the city. Portico Eritrean and Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar recently opened at 1050 South Havana in Aurora, in the former home of El Jaripeo. Look for more like this in the coming months. Many chefs and other professionals in or adjacent to the restaurant industry found themselves out of work in 2020 but rather than give up, they started their own businesses making food from cottage kitchens and commissaries. One of the first was Pandemic Donuts , which began life as a delivery only doughnut bakery last April and is now in the process of moving in with Queen City Coffee Collective in Five Points. KREAM Kimchi started out as a project to hand deliver free kimchi to friends of founder Virgil Dickerson and is now a going concern that has grown by leaps and bounds. Chefs Eric Chiappetta and Dave Hadley launched Minga Provisions and the Samosa Shop , respectively, and pasta delivery companies such as Fantasioso Foods and Casa Crobu also debuted, giving folks stuck at home ready to cook alternatives to takeout food. Will we find some of these products on grocery store shelves in 2021? It would be great to see more locally made food products next to national brands. The State of Colorado's color coded COVID dial doesn't leave much room for watering holes that don't serve food or haven't found a way to partner with food trucks, neighboring restaurants or other food producers. Bars with no form of food service can't open under current Level Red or Orange restrictions, and even as we slide into Yellow and Blue, they will not be able to open. It's not until we hit Level Green (or Protect Our Neighbors, the lightest level of restrictions) that bars can reopen at 50 percent capacity. Why?

Keyo Park West,"Big Impact with a Small Footprint Freddie Martin, a student of history and anthropology, talks to me outside his home in Denver on a cloudy day in December. He s a formidable character who grew up in Beaumont, Texas with strong viewpoints on the state of politics in our country. He shares some of his writing with me just outside House 6, his home at the Beloved Community Village. I ve been through quite a bit in my time, says Martin. I ve been housing insecure for over a decade. Martin has been a Villager since March 2018, after meeting Cilla Wolf, a former Beloved Community Village resident, on the campus of Metro State University. Being here has given him the chance to finish his degrees. The Colorado Village Collaborative exists to create and operate transformational housing communities for people exiting homelessness and entering housing. The fight for decriminalization of homelessness and finding housing solutions has been a long one in Denver. Like Charlotte, the city has seen rapid growth over the past two decades. The median home value has risen from 222,550 to 409,900 in the past 10 years. Average rent for a one bedroom apartment is 1,423 a month. To afford an apartment within 10 miles of metro Denver, an individual making minimum wage salary, which is 11.10/hour, four dollars more than that of North Carolina, must work 130 hours a week, four weeks a month. People are regularly pushed out of areas as gentrification sweeps in leaving limited affordable housing options close to jobs, food and services. Denver Homeless Out Loud started building tiny homes in 2013 following the passage of an Unauthorized Camping Ban ordinance which made it illegal for those experiencing homelessness to sleep on public property. When the group organized the voices of those living on the streets, one of the ideas that quickly popped up was the idea of creating a tiny home village. It was something people on the street specifically wanted, says Cole Chandler. We didn t dream this up in a lab somewhere. Chandler, who cites his faith as a leading factor in his work, is a community organizer and serves as the co director of the Colorado Village Collaborative. (Note: In December, the U. S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case in which the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a camping ban in Boise, Idaho, and citing that case, a Denver County judge ruled that the city s urban camping ban is unconstitutional, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment. ) In 2015, Denver Homeless Out Loud staged a direct action in Sustainability Park, a historic low income housing space that sat vacant for over 20 years after housing was torn down by the city. They quickly set up 10 tiny homes. Within 12 hours, police raided the area, arresting 10 people and destroying the site. In 2016, the Alternative Solutions Advocacy Project, a broader coalition, was created under the leadership of the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado. We started to get some traction, says Chandler. The coalition brought together advocates, service providers, people on the street, academics, the faith community and business leaders. The Urban Land Conservancy offered a piece of land and the Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) was formed. In July 2017, Beloved Community Village, the city s first tiny home community, opened with its first 11 homes built through grassroots organizing and over 400 volunteers. The city s zoning and permitting laws created barriers for the project. Most of the city is restricted to single unit or two unit zoning, and the tiny homes at Beloved Community Village don t have running water or sewer, preventing them from existing under standard building codes. It s not what the city would consider a dwelling unit, says Chandler. The 8 by 12 foot dormitory style units were built in a hub and spoke community design with a central shower facility. The village currently uses portable toilets and is building a new community building that will provide lockers, private bathrooms with showers, a kitchen and eating area. A widely accepted industry definition identifies a tiny house as a dwelling that is 500 square feet or less and they ve been made popular by HGTV, while providing options for affordable housing throughout the country. Beloved Community Village is adding another nine units, bringing the project to a total of 20 homes. The village and infrastructure costs approximately 600,000 in the city of Denver, much more affordable than a traditional shelter. According to Aldo s Restoration and Construction in Charlotte, a local tiny home builder, the average price of a tiny home is 25,000, approximately 10 times cheaper than the average price of building a typical home. In 2018, Charlotte City Council weighed the options for tiny houses prompted by the proposed Keyo Park West development in the Coulwood neighborhood. According to the Charlotte Business Journal, the project, which later fell through and resulted in several lawsuits, prompted a discussion by city planning staff about how tiny homes would fit within current local and state building and zoning codes, including whether a new overlay district for neighborhood conservation would be pursued a motion that ultimately was tabled. In a Transportation Planning Committee meeting on Feb. 19, 2018, Charlotte City Council Member Tariq Bakhari (District 6) stated So the crux of the decision of this Committee and ultimately the full Council needs to come to is do we want to change anything that would prohibit or put some requirements around this, and I assume that would lead to what are the reasons why? Obviously affordable house (sic) is a big deal, and this seems like a very innovative solution for it. In what scenarios of affordable housing may we want to make this easier to do? The Beloved Community Village was made possible by an ordinance passed by Denver City Council, carving out a space in the city s existing zoning and building codes. The update allowed for tiny home village permits that last up to 180 days, with a chance for renewal. Leadership in Community Planning Development believed in the vision and was really willing to work to figure out a solution to make this viable, says Polly Kyle, senior aide for Denver City Councilwoman Robin Kniech. In Denver, Chandler, Kniech and others sought ways to activate vacant city land or land that was already scheduled for development. Both land acquisition and land availability were cited challenges in a 2016 Charlotte Mecklenburg Strategies for Affordable Housing Development report. Land acquisition costs were cited as one of the largest barriers for building affordable housing especially in higher income communities and along transit corridors. It can also be complicated to find opportunity for multifamily properties in neighborhoods traditionally zoned for single family. Eight four percent of residential land in Charlotte is zoned for single family homes, but there s growing momentum that could bring changes allowing for more options in the city s traditional neighborhoods. The tiny homes at Beloved Community Village are built on jack stands, previously cement foundation blocks, so they are easy to move. Vacant land that has been cleared for future development provides an opportunity to utilize the land while necessary planning and permitting is completed. The former site of CVC s first project was developed into a 16 story market rate apartment building causing them to move to its current location in Globeville, which is leased by the city to CVC for 10 a year. According to Kyle, the city s Housing an Inclusive Denver plan is working to build and preserve affordable housing, and the city continues to look at group living ordinances to allow for more options. A vocal supporter of the project, Councilwoman Kniech pushed forward for a legal path for villages to expand and get services, pulling temporary tiny homes out of the group living process and passing a new ordinance in October 2019 that would expedite the process. In the last budget cycle, they secured an additional 125,000 in the city budget to connect villagers to permanent housing. Intentional Community The first year of Beloved Community Village was a success for residents and neighbors alike, despite initial community pushback. According to the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, The Village had no negative impacts on the neighborhood and people who live in the village are more stable. Daniel Brisson, from Denver University Graduate School of Social Work, describes it as intentional community. The Village is built around the concept of shared governance where residents decide who moves in and create rules for the community. In doing so, residents build relationships and skills around a consensus model. Dorothy Leyba is a Village Organizer for CVC and provides individual support to villagers while building community outside the village. She sees how the setup helps build advocacy, personal pride and leadership skills within the village. Residents must follow six basic community agreements: 1. No violence. 2. No weapons. 3. No illegal drugs. 4. No discriminatory behavior. 5. No continuously disruptive behavior. 6. Participation in community. During the first year, five villagers moved out three into permanent housing and two being expelled for violating the agreements. While touring the Beloved Community Village, villagers go about their daily chores. One villager meets with a case manager while sounds of construction on the new community house and additional tiny homes roars ahead. Villagers regularly go in and out of each other s homes, connecting with each other and truly living as a family unit. This is one of the most diverse communities that you ll see, says Chandler. People don t generally opt into diversity. Of the 22 residents we ve had, three have been transgender and a significant portion of the population have been people of color. It s people of all ages, people from all over the country and all education levels, too. That s not what a typical neighborhood looks like. One in five transgender people in the United States has been discriminated against when seeking a home, and more than one in 10 have been evicted from their homes because of their gender identity. Homelessness is a critical issue with one in five transgender people experiencing homelessness at some point in their lives, in large part because of familial or employment discrimination. One of the community partners of CVC is the Delores Project, which houses adult women and transgender people that are facing homelessness. The shelter is part of a larger project in partnership with the affordable housing developer Rocky Mountain Communities, which together own and operate an entire city block built with Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Arroyo Village. The block includes the shelter as well as 35 units of low income permanent supportive housing and 95 units of affordable housing for individuals and families in the workforce. The space is specifically designed for people with trauma history in mind, with large southern facing windows, plants, wood features, and soothing colors and textiles. Delores Project offers case management, life skills training, housing stability programming and emergency beds for people being released from incarceration. The goal is to move people from homelessness to stable housing. Within their first two visits, they re writing up a housing plan, says Emily Wheeland, program director at Delores Project. Former Beloved Community Village resident Silla Wolfe interviewed in The Right to Rest, a film by Sarah Megyesy and Guillermo Roques. Wolfe is one of 3 transgender residents to have lived at Beloved Community Village The area around the Delores Project is quickly gentrifying and it is the only overnight shelter in the city that is open and celebratory of transgender individuals, serving anyone that identifies along the transgender spectrum and including features like single use restrooms, private shower stalls and changing facilities. About 10 percent of the people we see self identify as trans, says Wheeland. We see a lot of folks that come from other states that we re the nearest big city to the west, that are coming from smaller towns or states that might not be as trans friendly as Denver is. A Place To Call Home I understand what it s like for people to have something they can call their own to have a key, and to have that security and that sense of empowerment, really means a lot to people, says Freddie Martin. It really makes a big difference. I never really felt like a real part of a community before. People here are amazingly open and caring and honest. The people here have been through things. They understand what suffering is. I ve always had people in my life that don t necessarily understand suffering, so it s hard for them to contend with people who are suffering, but that s one of the wonderful things about this place. People have been through things, and they re grateful for what they have. In theory, Beloved Community Village can be a unique stepping stone for people utilizing shelter services at places like the Delores Project before moving on to more permanent housing, be it shared apartments or affordable housing. We have a lot to learn about how to make this the most successful place it can be, says Chandler. This is a different emergent kind of thing. This is not a silver bullet. This is what happens when a community comes together to address a big problem. One of the things that came out of that first study was we took a vacant lot that was right across the street from a light rail station a place with a lot of activity and no eyes on the street says Chandler discussing a study by the Denver University s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. We put the village there, and crime actually decreased in the direct blocks surrounding it. That s not something that people expect, but activating a vacant lot is a valuable thing. I see the potential of this village. I want to see it expand. I want to see more villages. It s not permanent housing, but it is a stepping stone for our villagers to get permanent housing. Colorado Village Collaborative is working on creating a transgender inclusive women s village and will start a community engagement plan to find the right site this year. They would like to build 15 additional homes with a shared community space like the new one being constructed at Beloved Community. Chandler brings up the idea of tiny home villages in every city council district across Denver. On a consistent basis, the city has around 600 people living in unsheltered homelessness on any given night. Could we essentially achieve a functional zero in terms of that population by offering a humane solution that is scattered around the city. Wheeland from the Delores Project talks about changing the entire philosophy of serving those who face homelessness. By providing housing first and then continuing services like community support, mental health and life skills training after they have some type of housing stability will allow for greater impact in the community. The ultimate goal is housing, right? So, the pathway sometimes does look like they re going into a tiny home for two years. They re going into some transitional housing, before they re moving into permanent housing. It just starts by building relationships and seeing people that are struggling as our neighbors and as our family, and finding that compassion in our hearts, says Chandler. This is a seed of what the world could be.

River North Art District,"Property values are up more than 50% in this isolated neighborhood 3 miles from downtown Denver The Globeville neighborhood remains one of Denver's most affordable and historic neighborhoods, even as it's surrounded by change on all sides. DENVER Though the skyscrapers of downtown loom just on the other side of the Platte River, the Globeville neighborhood has had a distinct character separate from the Mile High City throughout its long history. Once ranchland, Globeville s land was purchased by the Globe Smelter Company in 1885 attracting a huge population of European immigrants to the area. Some of those families have stayed in the rows of houses that make up Globeville for generations, staying put even as Interstate 70 and I 25 sliced through the area in the 1960s. Today, Globeville s boundaries are the South Platte River to the east and south, Inca Street to the west, and 52nd Avenue to the north. The River North Art District, with its breweries and luxury condos, is just south of the neighborhood, and the National Western Stock Show Complex is to the north.

How a neighborhood about 20 blocks from downtown can actually be considered isolated As the crow flies, the Globeville neighborhood is technically closer to Union Station than City Park. But over the years, it s become intersected by interstates (there are only two ways to cross I 70 in Globeville s boundaries) and railroad tracks. There s also the Platte River itself. This meant that, unlike other Denver neighborhoods, Globeville grew inward around the smelter instead of outward. Between the late 1880s and 1920s, eastern European and Russian immigrants moved into Globeville to work low paying jobs at the smelter, the railroad or in the meatpacking industry. As some members of those families moved out of the neighborhood, they were replaced by a new, largely Hispanic community. Today, Globeville s population is around 4,200 people. More than half of those residents identify as Latino, and 20% are immigrants, according to DenverMetroData. org. The community s median household income is 46,225.57 well below the Denver metro region s median of 97,284.99. More than one third of Globeville s population lives in poverty, according to the same data. Old churches representing its diverse history dot the Globeville neighborhood. Mary Lou Egan, a Denver native whose grandparents lived in Globeville, made a map that essentially shows the neighborhood s progression and illustrates a cool walking tour of its history. Check that map out below: What does the future of Globeville look like? While the mixed use Taxi development is sometimes mischaracterized as being in RiNo, it's actually within Globeville boundaries. But Mickey Zeppelin, the developer responsible for Taxi and other prominent properties on the other side of the Platte, said he has a different vision for the future of Globeville. ""Globeville isn't going to be the next RiNo,"" Zeppelin said. ""Globeville needs to have its own character. I think Globeville has the possibility of becoming a major part of Denver in terms of the environment. There's probably as much parkland here as anywhere else in the city. "" Denver City Councilwoman Candi Cdebaca now represents Globeville and grew up nearby. She said she had family in the neighborhood's boundaries, and has watched people she knows get displaced by rising costs, even as improvements are coming to the area. ""I really hope that some of the changes will be available to the population that has endured generations of disinvestment the amenities, the newfound growth and opportunities are this neighborhood's inheritance, and I hope we can figure out how to protect these communities from involuntary displacement so they get to reap the benefits of their generational investment,"" Cdebaca said. The median property value in the city of Denver is 416,000. Denverite reports that Globeville's median 2019 property value was 292,400 up about 50% since 2017. Part of this is due to the expansion of the neighboring National Western Complex, which is expected to bring new development to Globeville and the Elyria Swansea neighborhoods. Zeppelin said efforts are underway to improve Washington Street, Globeville's main thoroughfare. Washington Street will really be an important main street. Right now, it s pretty much a commercial street and not really much shopping,"" Zeppelin said. ""It needs a supermarket, it needs all of the services that cities have, and I think it will have a pharmacy, cleaners, a beauty salon, etc I think it will be an important main street, it will have a fabulous plaza for people to meet. Cdebaca said there are benefits to development like new sidewalks and paved alleyways but said she hopes it doesn't negate the character of the neighborhood. We wanted connections with business and affordability those two things should not negate each other, you should be able to have all those things and live in an affordable community,"" Cdebaca said.

DENVER It's no secret that Denver is a popular travel destination, but some travelers are looking for more than a standard hotel room, they want an experience. That's why hostels are becoming a popular choice for savvy budget conscious travelers. ""I think the main thing is people are starting to see the communal aspect of it and really wanting to stay in a city in an affordable way but with the ability to make friends and meet people from all over the world,"" said Chad Fish, owner of Hostel Fish. Two new projects promise to offer guests that unique experience. Katz Development recently submitted plans to the City of Denver for a 7 story hotel located at 3495 Wynkoop Street. It will feature private rooms and shared rooms with bunk beds, there will also be food and beverage options inside. ""It looked like there was a gap where people could really access the neighborhood at an affordable price and feel like they re having an authentic experience,"" said Andrew Katz, the company's Principal Developer. Katz said when he initially acquired the property in Denver's River North Art District, he wasn't thinking about doing a hotel, but hopes the project will fill a void. There's several new hotels downtown but they aren't exactly cheap. He wants people to be able to experience all Denver has to offer and still have money leftover for those experiences. ""They want to feel like they re getting the real taste of living in Denver and living in this neighborhood,"" said Katz, ""You have the budget to allocate to actually go and doing those things because you re not spending as much on your room or where you re sleeping. "" The project concept is still in its early stages and does not have a name yet. Katz said he would like to break ground sometime next year. The manager of Ember Hostel in Denver's Capitol Hill neighborhood says the industry is booming. The owner of Hostel Fish says their target demographic is travelers age 21 to 35 but they've seen adventurous grandparents and families stay at their hostel too. ""You get the opportunity to actually make friends and use it as a base camp and then go out and experience the city together,"" said Fish.

Sustainability Park,"Big Impact with a Small Footprint Freddie Martin, a student of history and anthropology, talks to me outside his home in Denver on a cloudy day in December. He s a formidable character who grew up in Beaumont, Texas with strong viewpoints on the state of politics in our country. He shares some of his writing with me just outside House 6, his home at the Beloved Community Village. I ve been through quite a bit in my time, says Martin. I ve been housing insecure for over a decade. Martin has been a Villager since March 2018, after meeting Cilla Wolf, a former Beloved Community Village resident, on the campus of Metro State University. Being here has given him the chance to finish his degrees. The Colorado Village Collaborative exists to create and operate transformational housing communities for people exiting homelessness and entering housing. The fight for decriminalization of homelessness and finding housing solutions has been a long one in Denver. Like Charlotte, the city has seen rapid growth over the past two decades. The median home value has risen from 222,550 to 409,900 in the past 10 years. Average rent for a one bedroom apartment is 1,423 a month. To afford an apartment within 10 miles of metro Denver, an individual making minimum wage salary, which is 11.10/hour, four dollars more than that of North Carolina, must work 130 hours a week, four weeks a month. People are regularly pushed out of areas as gentrification sweeps in leaving limited affordable housing options close to jobs, food and services. Denver Homeless Out Loud started building tiny homes in 2013 following the passage of an Unauthorized Camping Ban ordinance which made it illegal for those experiencing homelessness to sleep on public property. When the group organized the voices of those living on the streets, one of the ideas that quickly popped up was the idea of creating a tiny home village. It was something people on the street specifically wanted, says Cole Chandler. We didn t dream this up in a lab somewhere. Chandler, who cites his faith as a leading factor in his work, is a community organizer and serves as the co director of the Colorado Village Collaborative. (Note: In December, the U. S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case in which the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a camping ban in Boise, Idaho, and citing that case, a Denver County judge ruled that the city s urban camping ban is unconstitutional, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment. ) In 2015, Denver Homeless Out Loud staged a direct action in Sustainability Park, a historic low income housing space that sat vacant for over 20 years after housing was torn down by the city. They quickly set up 10 tiny homes. Within 12 hours, police raided the area, arresting 10 people and destroying the site. In 2016, the Alternative Solutions Advocacy Project, a broader coalition, was created under the leadership of the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado. We started to get some traction, says Chandler. The coalition brought together advocates, service providers, people on the street, academics, the faith community and business leaders. The Urban Land Conservancy offered a piece of land and the Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) was formed. In July 2017, Beloved Community Village, the city s first tiny home community, opened with its first 11 homes built through grassroots organizing and over 400 volunteers. The city s zoning and permitting laws created barriers for the project. Most of the city is restricted to single unit or two unit zoning, and the tiny homes at Beloved Community Village don t have running water or sewer, preventing them from existing under standard building codes. It s not what the city would consider a dwelling unit, says Chandler. The 8 by 12 foot dormitory style units were built in a hub and spoke community design with a central shower facility. The village currently uses portable toilets and is building a new community building that will provide lockers, private bathrooms with showers, a kitchen and eating area. A widely accepted industry definition identifies a tiny house as a dwelling that is 500 square feet or less and they ve been made popular by HGTV, while providing options for affordable housing throughout the country. Beloved Community Village is adding another nine units, bringing the project to a total of 20 homes. The village and infrastructure costs approximately 600,000 in the city of Denver, much more affordable than a traditional shelter. According to Aldo s Restoration and Construction in Charlotte, a local tiny home builder, the average price of a tiny home is 25,000, approximately 10 times cheaper than the average price of building a typical home. In 2018, Charlotte City Council weighed the options for tiny houses prompted by the proposed Keyo Park West development in the Coulwood neighborhood. According to the Charlotte Business Journal, the project, which later fell through and resulted in several lawsuits, prompted a discussion by city planning staff about how tiny homes would fit within current local and state building and zoning codes, including whether a new overlay district for neighborhood conservation would be pursued a motion that ultimately was tabled. In a Transportation Planning Committee meeting on Feb. 19, 2018, Charlotte City Council Member Tariq Bakhari (District 6) stated So the crux of the decision of this Committee and ultimately the full Council needs to come to is do we want to change anything that would prohibit or put some requirements around this, and I assume that would lead to what are the reasons why? Obviously affordable house (sic) is a big deal, and this seems like a very innovative solution for it. In what scenarios of affordable housing may we want to make this easier to do? The Beloved Community Village was made possible by an ordinance passed by Denver City Council, carving out a space in the city s existing zoning and building codes. The update allowed for tiny home village permits that last up to 180 days, with a chance for renewal. Leadership in Community Planning Development believed in the vision and was really willing to work to figure out a solution to make this viable, says Polly Kyle, senior aide for Denver City Councilwoman Robin Kniech. In Denver, Chandler, Kniech and others sought ways to activate vacant city land or land that was already scheduled for development. Both land acquisition and land availability were cited challenges in a 2016 Charlotte Mecklenburg Strategies for Affordable Housing Development report. Land acquisition costs were cited as one of the largest barriers for building affordable housing especially in higher income communities and along transit corridors. It can also be complicated to find opportunity for multifamily properties in neighborhoods traditionally zoned for single family. Eight four percent of residential land in Charlotte is zoned for single family homes, but there s growing momentum that could bring changes allowing for more options in the city s traditional neighborhoods. The tiny homes at Beloved Community Village are built on jack stands, previously cement foundation blocks, so they are easy to move. Vacant land that has been cleared for future development provides an opportunity to utilize the land while necessary planning and permitting is completed. The former site of CVC s first project was developed into a 16 story market rate apartment building causing them to move to its current location in Globeville, which is leased by the city to CVC for 10 a year. According to Kyle, the city s Housing an Inclusive Denver plan is working to build and preserve affordable housing, and the city continues to look at group living ordinances to allow for more options. A vocal supporter of the project, Councilwoman Kniech pushed forward for a legal path for villages to expand and get services, pulling temporary tiny homes out of the group living process and passing a new ordinance in October 2019 that would expedite the process. In the last budget cycle, they secured an additional 125,000 in the city budget to connect villagers to permanent housing. Intentional Community The first year of Beloved Community Village was a success for residents and neighbors alike, despite initial community pushback. According to the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, The Village had no negative impacts on the neighborhood and people who live in the village are more stable. Daniel Brisson, from Denver University Graduate School of Social Work, describes it as intentional community. The Village is built around the concept of shared governance where residents decide who moves in and create rules for the community. In doing so, residents build relationships and skills around a consensus model. Dorothy Leyba is a Village Organizer for CVC and provides individual support to villagers while building community outside the village. She sees how the setup helps build advocacy, personal pride and leadership skills within the village. Residents must follow six basic community agreements: 1. No violence. 2. No weapons. 3. No illegal drugs. 4. No discriminatory behavior. 5. No continuously disruptive behavior. 6. Participation in community. During the first year, five villagers moved out three into permanent housing and two being expelled for violating the agreements. While touring the Beloved Community Village, villagers go about their daily chores. One villager meets with a case manager while sounds of construction on the new community house and additional tiny homes roars ahead. Villagers regularly go in and out of each other s homes, connecting with each other and truly living as a family unit. This is one of the most diverse communities that you ll see, says Chandler. People don t generally opt into diversity. Of the 22 residents we ve had, three have been transgender and a significant portion of the population have been people of color. It s people of all ages, people from all over the country and all education levels, too. That s not what a typical neighborhood looks like. One in five transgender people in the United States has been discriminated against when seeking a home, and more than one in 10 have been evicted from their homes because of their gender identity. Homelessness is a critical issue with one in five transgender people experiencing homelessness at some point in their lives, in large part because of familial or employment discrimination. One of the community partners of CVC is the Delores Project, which houses adult women and transgender people that are facing homelessness. The shelter is part of a larger project in partnership with the affordable housing developer Rocky Mountain Communities, which together own and operate an entire city block built with Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Arroyo Village. The block includes the shelter as well as 35 units of low income permanent supportive housing and 95 units of affordable housing for individuals and families in the workforce. The space is specifically designed for people with trauma history in mind, with large southern facing windows, plants, wood features, and soothing colors and textiles. Delores Project offers case management, life skills training, housing stability programming and emergency beds for people being released from incarceration. The goal is to move people from homelessness to stable housing. Within their first two visits, they re writing up a housing plan, says Emily Wheeland, program director at Delores Project. Former Beloved Community Village resident Silla Wolfe interviewed in The Right to Rest, a film by Sarah Megyesy and Guillermo Roques. Wolfe is one of 3 transgender residents to have lived at Beloved Community Village The area around the Delores Project is quickly gentrifying and it is the only overnight shelter in the city that is open and celebratory of transgender individuals, serving anyone that identifies along the transgender spectrum and including features like single use restrooms, private shower stalls and changing facilities. About 10 percent of the people we see self identify as trans, says Wheeland. We see a lot of folks that come from other states that we re the nearest big city to the west, that are coming from smaller towns or states that might not be as trans friendly as Denver is. A Place To Call Home I understand what it s like for people to have something they can call their own to have a key, and to have that security and that sense of empowerment, really means a lot to people, says Freddie Martin. It really makes a big difference. I never really felt like a real part of a community before. People here are amazingly open and caring and honest. The people here have been through things. They understand what suffering is. I ve always had people in my life that don t necessarily understand suffering, so it s hard for them to contend with people who are suffering, but that s one of the wonderful things about this place. People have been through things, and they re grateful for what they have. In theory, Beloved Community Village can be a unique stepping stone for people utilizing shelter services at places like the Delores Project before moving on to more permanent housing, be it shared apartments or affordable housing. We have a lot to learn about how to make this the most successful place it can be, says Chandler. This is a different emergent kind of thing. This is not a silver bullet. This is what happens when a community comes together to address a big problem. One of the things that came out of that first study was we took a vacant lot that was right across the street from a light rail station a place with a lot of activity and no eyes on the street says Chandler discussing a study by the Denver University s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. We put the village there, and crime actually decreased in the direct blocks surrounding it. That s not something that people expect, but activating a vacant lot is a valuable thing. I see the potential of this village. I want to see it expand. I want to see more villages. It s not permanent housing, but it is a stepping stone for our villagers to get permanent housing. Colorado Village Collaborative is working on creating a transgender inclusive women s village and will start a community engagement plan to find the right site this year. They would like to build 15 additional homes with a shared community space like the new one being constructed at Beloved Community. Chandler brings up the idea of tiny home villages in every city council district across Denver. On a consistent basis, the city has around 600 people living in unsheltered homelessness on any given night. Could we essentially achieve a functional zero in terms of that population by offering a humane solution that is scattered around the city. Wheeland from the Delores Project talks about changing the entire philosophy of serving those who face homelessness. By providing housing first and then continuing services like community support, mental health and life skills training after they have some type of housing stability will allow for greater impact in the community. The ultimate goal is housing, right? So, the pathway sometimes does look like they re going into a tiny home for two years. They re going into some transitional housing, before they re moving into permanent housing. It just starts by building relationships and seeing people that are struggling as our neighbors and as our family, and finding that compassion in our hearts, says Chandler. This is a seed of what the world could be.

Elyria Swansea,"New research maps where housing and health crises collide in Colorado The question is what to do with it. Researchers who have mapped neighborhoods across Colorado where housing and health crises overlap hope an online tool they developed will help policy makers and advocates decide how best to use limited resources to support struggling communities. The purpose of this study is really to be a conversation starter, said Elysia Clemens, deputy director of the Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab at the University of Denver, which funded the study. According to the study released late last year, 71 census tracts 6 percent of all census tracts in Colorado have significantly higher rates than the state average of both households spending more than they can comfortably afford on rent and of people experiencing mental health issues. Most of those 71 neighborhoods were in metro areas such as Denver along the Front Range. Researchers Jieun Lee, an assistant professor in the University of Northern Colorado s Department of Geography, and Ivan Ramirez, a visiting assistant professor in the University of Colorado Denver s Department of Health and Behavioral Sciences, said the results of the study they conducted bolstered national research by others that has shown a link between housing and health. Ultimately, lack of access to affordable housing is stressful, both physically and emotionally, especially when it may lead to eviction and homelessness, Lee and Ramirez wrote in a study that added a geographic dimension to that social and economic reality. They said their work could highlight the exact locations to target resources and programs. Phillip Chung, senior director of evaluation and learning at Mile High United Way, said too often data is collected and studied in isolation, which can make it hard to see the multiple factors that burden communities. Mile High United Way s work includes granting millions of dollars to support organizations working in such areas as education, health and economic stability. The Lee and Ramirez research is an important step toward looking holistically, Chung said. Chung was not involved in the study, for which Lee and Ramirez looked at households spending 30 percent or more of their income on rent, leaving little cushion for low and moderate income families who also have to pay for food, transportation, health care and other necessities. Lee and Ramirez also looked at data on three mental health factors: people who described themselves as having poor mental health in response to a survey conducted every other year by the Colorado Health Institute, suicide rates, and death rates linked to drug use. The researchers identified census tracts where the percentage of households spending at least 30 percent of income on rent was higher than the state average, which was a startling 50 percent in 2018, according to the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority. Lee and Ramirez also identified census tracts where mental health issues were higher than the state average. Statewide, about 15 percent of Coloradans said they had poor mental health, according to the 2019 Colorado Health Access Survey. Colorado saw just over 20 suicides for every 100,000 people in 2017, and just under 20 drug related deaths for every 100,000 people in 2017, according to the state health department. The publicly available mapping tool released alongside the Lee Ramirez study allows a viewer to, at the click of a mouse, see data across the state or drill down to a census tract. Lee and Ramirez also provided maps that make access to mental health care visual. Those maps are not part of the mapping tool. Digging down to pages 25 to 28 of their report is required to see that the neighborhoods with higher than average rates of rent burdened households and of people experiencing mental health issues aren t necessarily under served when it comes to being within a 30 minute drive of a mental health care treatment facility, substance abuse treatment facility or community behavioral health centers. Use this slider to compare the study s mental health distress and rent burdened layers for the Denver area. Darker colors represent higher concentrations. See the whole map here. Lee and Ramirez explored further and found that in general, neighborhoods that were under served by treatment and behavioral health facilities did have higher rates of suicide and rent burdened households. Yet neighborhoods that were better served had higher rates of drug related deaths, suggesting, the researchers said, that even more access is needed or there are other barriers to access that play a role, such as social stigma or cost. It was one area of further possible study highlighted by the data. Brittany Katalenas, a social worker with training in the descriptive and analytical mapping techniques Lee and Ramirez used, saw another potential line of inquiry after reading the study, with which she was not involved. Katalenas, who founded an organization to connect low income families to housing, said she would like to see a map showing where renters who use federal vouchers are able to find housing. In her experience, she said, it s often in neighborhoods with little access to mental health and other support services struggling families need. If you really want to get at the root causes of poverty and mental health, we have to look at the concentration of poverty, she said. Our vouchers are concentrating poverty, Katalenas said. I thought the study was good ish, she said of the work of Lee and Ramirez. But we need to see more. Clemens, whose Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab funded the study, said that the goal of this first step was not to determine the why behind the data. This was really kind of an exploratory study, said Clemens, who was one of the editors of the study. Clemens s lab connects academics to state and local governments. In the case of the Lee and Ramirez project, researchers had proposed a study of any relationship between asthma and low income housing. Clemens reached out to state housing officials, who said they wanted to know more about mental health issues. That s what generated the focus, Clemens said. We try to be a bridge and a translator. Cathy Phelps, executive director of Denver s Center for Trauma Resilience, said staff at organizations such as hers who provide counseling and other services to under served communities have seen how unstable housing can lead to mental stress, which can in turn make it harder to secure housing. If vulnerable people had additional emotional, social support, we could steady them, Phelps said. Phelps questioned, though, whether highlighting struggling neighborhoods as the Lee and Ramirez study does could result in stigmatizing those areas. Clemens said how data is used determines whether information is stigmatizing or strengthening. Researchers, journalists, and community leaders have the power to frame and use these findings as an opportunity to strengthen communities, Clemens said. We have the responsibility to use the information as a conversation starter about how and where to making smart, culturally responsive investments and policies. We also need to acknowledge that this is map is one piece of information, not the full story for any community. Christine Benero, president and CEO of Mile High United Way, said data such as the information gathered by Lee and Ramirez was a starting point, a guide to determining which neighborhoods needed attention. The next step, she said, was to look at the strengths of those communities. United Way also compiles research to inform decision making. A United Way database of behavioral health centers and other community resources helped Denver s Department of Public Safety develop the Community Asset and Resource Mapping Application, or CARMA, an app police officers have been piloting to guide people in crisis to services. The Lee and Ramirez study was striking for Jules Kelty, executive director Focus Points Family Resource Center. What it tells me is that, no matter what, I need to make sure that mental health is something I should always provide, Kelty said. Thanks to a partnership with the Mental Health Center of Denver, a full time mental health professional who is fluent in English and Spanish offers counseling in an office at the Focus Points headquarters in Elyria Swansea. Some neighbors, Kelty said, are spending 50 percent or more of their income on housing. Many of the people the nonprofit serves are new to the United States, sometimes having fled violence or instability in other parts of the world. Referrals to the on site therapist are made by staff of such Focus Points projects as job skill training, a food pantry, English classes or a program that offers assistance with mortgage payments or rent. You cannot break the cycle of poverty until you address mental health, Kelty said.  DPS: Swansea Elementary closed until at least Friday following fire This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. DENVER Swansea Elementary School in the Elyria Swansea neighborhood will be closed until at least Friday following a fire, Denver Public Schools said Wednesday. DPS spokesperson Will Jones says about 3:30 a. m. Wednesday, an Xcel Energy transformer failed. When it was repaired and reconnected, there was a spike in electricity that caused a complete power outage and the fire. No one was injured in the fire. However, it caused significant damage to ceilings, carpeting and the school s kitchen. Some of the carpet and ceiling will need to be cleaned or replaced. Additionally, electricians will be checking electrical panels throughout the school. Staff will also need to ensure the kitchen is usable before classes resume. Swansea Elementary Principal Gilberto Mu oz sent the following letter to families about the fire: We wanted to provide you an update on the status of our school building. At approximately 3:30 a. m. on Wednesday morning, an Xcel Energy transformer failed. When it was repaired and reconnected a spike in the electricity severely damaged our system. It caused a complete electrical outage at our school and required the cancellation of class today. We know the unexpected cancellation of classes causes a hardship for families, and we appreciate your patience and understanding. Our Facilities Team has been working since early this morning to assess the damage and make the repairs necessary to get the school safe and ready for staff and students. We now know that the damage is severe enough that Swansea will remain closed on Thursday and Friday to complete the necessary repair work. We are working hard to make sure that repairs happen as quickly as possible so that students can return to school. A generator has been delivered to the school, which will eventually allow us to run our boiler, heaters and fire alarms. Some classrooms have damaged ceiling tiles and carpeting, which will need to be cleaned or replaced. Electricians are checking panels and circuits throughout the school to ensure that all operations are safe before students return to the building. There is also work that needs to be done to the school s kitchen. We are working to ensure it s fully functional and able to provide meals when school reopens. We will continue to provide you with updates as we learn more information about when Swansea will reopen. Please be assured that the safety and well being of our students and staff is our top priority. All measures are being taken to allow our community to return as quickly as possible to a safe and functional school. Thank you again for your support and patience as we work to get the school reopened as quickly as possible, while ensuring it s safe for our students and staff. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. You may also contact the Family and Community Helpline at 720 423 3054. On Thursday, Mu oz said daycare will be available Friday from 8 a. m. until 4 p. m. at Garden Place Academy: 4425 Lincoln St. , Denver, 80216. Our Swansea teachers will be on site to welcome and supervise students who choose to come. Breakfast and lunch will be served to students. Students are not required to attend if families have made other arrangements for tomorrow, Mu oz said. 39.781049 104.956449 Property values are up more than 50% in this isolated neighborhood 3 miles from downtown Denver The Globeville neighborhood remains one of Denver's most affordable and historic neighborhoods, even as it's surrounded by change on all sides. DENVER Though the skyscrapers of downtown loom just on the other side of the Platte River, the Globeville neighborhood has had a distinct character separate from the Mile High City throughout its long history. Once ranchland, Globeville s land was purchased by the Globe Smelter Company in 1885 attracting a huge population of European immigrants to the area. Some of those families have stayed in the rows of houses that make up Globeville for generations, staying put even as Interstate 70 and I 25 sliced through the area in the 1960s. Today, Globeville s boundaries are the South Platte River to the east and south, Inca Street to the west, and 52nd Avenue to the north. The River North Art District, with its breweries and luxury condos, is just south of the neighborhood, and the National Western Stock Show Complex is to the north. Median property values have risen 50% in two years in Globeville prompting concerns about the displacement of the community s longtime residents and gentrification in one of Denver s last relatively affordable communities. This story is part of the weekly 9Neighborhoods series. Join us at noon on Friday on the 9NEWS Instagram for a photo tour of Globeville. Have a recommendation for which neighborhood we should check out next? Email us at webteam 9news. com. How a neighborhood about 20 blocks from downtown can actually be considered isolated As the crow flies, the Globeville neighborhood is technically closer to Union Station than City Park. But over the years, it s become intersected by interstates (there are only two ways to cross I 70 in Globeville s boundaries) and railroad tracks. There s also the Platte River itself. This meant that, unlike other Denver neighborhoods, Globeville grew inward around the smelter instead of outward. Between the late 1880s and 1920s, eastern European and Russian immigrants moved into Globeville to work low paying jobs at the smelter, the railroad or in the meatpacking industry. As some members of those families moved out of the neighborhood, they were replaced by a new, largely Hispanic community. Today, Globeville s population is around 4,200 people. More than half of those residents identify as Latino, and 20% are immigrants, according to DenverMetroData. org. The community s median household income is 46,225.57 well below the Denver metro region s median of 97,284.99. More than one third of Globeville s population lives in poverty, according to the same data. Old churches representing its diverse history dot the Globeville neighborhood. Mary Lou Egan, a Denver native whose grandparents lived in Globeville, made a map that essentially shows the neighborhood s progression and illustrates a cool walking tour of its history. Check that map out below: What does the future of Globeville look like? While the mixed use Taxi development is sometimes mischaracterized as being in RiNo, it's actually within Globeville boundaries. But Mickey Zeppelin, the developer responsible for Taxi and other prominent properties on the other side of the Platte, said he has a different vision for the future of Globeville. ""Globeville isn't going to be the next RiNo,"" Zeppelin said. ""Globeville needs to have its own character. I think Globeville has the possibility of becoming a major part of Denver in terms of the environment. There's probably as much parkland here as anywhere else in the city. "" Denver City Councilwoman Candi Cdebaca now represents Globeville and grew up nearby. She said she had family in the neighborhood's boundaries, and has watched people she knows get displaced by rising costs, even as improvements are coming to the area. ""I really hope that some of the changes will be available to the population that has endured generations of disinvestment the amenities, the newfound growth and opportunities are this neighborhood's inheritance, and I hope we can figure out how to protect these communities from involuntary displacement so they get to reap the benefits of their generational investment,"" Cdebaca said. The median property value in the city of Denver is 416,000. Denverite reports that Globeville's median 2019 property value was 292,400 up about 50% since 2017. Part of this is due to the expansion of the neighboring National Western Complex, which is expected to bring new development to Globeville and the Elyria Swansea neighborhoods. Zeppelin said efforts are underway to improve Washington Street, Globeville's main thoroughfare. Washington Street will really be an important main street. Right now, it s pretty much a commercial street and not really much shopping,"" Zeppelin said. ""It needs a supermarket, it needs all of the services that cities have, and I think it will have a pharmacy, cleaners, a beauty salon, etc I think it will be an important main street, it will have a fabulous plaza for people to meet. Cdebaca said there are benefits to development like new sidewalks and paved alleyways but said she hopes it doesn't negate the character of the neighborhood. We wanted connections with business and affordability those two things should not negate each other, you should be able to have all those things and live in an affordable community,"" Cdebaca said.

South Caraway Road,"Top 8 headlines of 2020 JONESBORO, Ark. (KAIT) 2020 was a busy year in Region 8 and nationwide, especially with the COVID 19 pandemic. However, Region 8 News took a look at some of the other big stories of the year: An EF 3 tornado ripped through Jonesboro on March 28, damaging businesses and homes from the South Caraway Road area to the Farville Curve area. The storm ripped the roof and leveled part of the Mall at Turtle Creek that day. The mall has yet to fully reopen. As first responders worked to assess the damage, they set a command post up at the mall. That s when you saw people from all over pitch in to help. You know that was, that was one of the most humbling experiences, to say the least, Craighead Co. Judge Marvin Day said. When you, when you look up and you realize how great a community that we live in. Our second story, the disappearance and the murder of a young Jackson County woman. Sydney Sutherland disappeared after going out for a jog in August. Days later, Region 8 News learned she had been kidnapped, raped and killed. Her accused killer Quake Lewellyn was charged in this case. The gruesome crime rocked the community, including Jackson County Sheriff David Lucas. I m alright. It s a job. I do my job. I ll have time to reflect once the job is done, Sheriff Lucas said. Our third story brings us to Randolph County, where the woman accused of killing Former State Senator Linda Collins pleaded guilty. In August, Rebecca O Donnell told Judge John Fogleman she intentionally killed Collins in her home, back on June 2019 and hid the body. He sentenced her to 50 years in prison, bringing closure to her family. Today we find some shred of peace that Rebecca O Donnell will be put away in prison for a very long time, unable to hurt anyone else, Collins daughter, Tate Williams, said. An Izard County cold case was solved this year. The man accused of killing Rebekah Gould was arrested in Oregon. Investigators say William Miller was visiting from Texas in 2004 when he killed Gould and dumped her body of off Highway 9, just south of Melbourne. Hopefully this will provide some closure to family, Izard Co. Sheriff Jack Yancey said. A lot of times, just the not knowing is a terrible burden to carry around. His trial is set for August 25. Newport Police Lt. Patrick Weatherford s family in Newport got news this year as well. The man accused of of killing the officer in 2017 pleaded guilty in October 2020. He was a juvenile at the time of his offenses but he was charged as an adult. Court documents say he confessed to the shooting and he was sentenced to 42 years in prison. An elected official was indicted in 2020 for wire fraud. He had created a system to do this, Craighead Co. Judge Day said. Craighead County Clerk Kade Holliday is accused of stealing over 1.4 million in county funds for his personal gain. The investigation tied up at least two businesses: Twisted Foods and The Edge Coffee House and Eatery. Two days after Holliday s arrest, the Northeast Arkansas Business Leadership Council also accused him of stealing between 15,000 to 20,000 as the de facto treasurer. He pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of wire fraud earlier this month. A push for change also dominated the year. No justice. No peace, chanted many back in June on South Caraway Road in Jonesboro. Citizens spent days protesting after the death of George Floyd while in custody in Minneapolis. We heard from people in your communities say why they were marching. I had a family member get shot by a police officer and it touched the family hard. George touched home and I feel like he was one of my family members, one man said. Citizens pushed the community, local and state officials to make changes in policing and face the truth about social injustices. In Paragould, Police Chief Todd Stovall joined the crowd and even took a knee. In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created the Task Force to Advance the State of Law Enforcement to look at what could be improved. The group turned in their recommendations for law enforcement agencies in the state earlier this month. The body of a woman missing for years was found in October. Lisa Prescott disappeared in September 2018 and she didn t meet the requirements of a Silver Alert. That s why the family searched themselves. It wasn t until 17 days after she disappeared they were able to organize a large search with help from EquuSearch and Jonesboro police. Ultimately, finding her body over two years later. The family says they know there are so many questions left with a lot of speculation floating around on this case. Copyright 2020 KAIT. All rights reserved.

Crabapple Road,"Loan renewed for Belmont slip repairs ST. CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County s board of commissioners heard an update on road slip repair Wednesday. Commissioners Josh Meyer, J. P. Dutton and Jerry Echemann renewed a 4 million loan to pay part of the cost of repairing, constructing and reconstructing roads in the county. The commissioners also approved Dinsmore Shohl LLP to act as bond counsel. A federal disaster was declared for the local area last February. According to the county engineer s office, Belmont County sustained close to 12 million worth of road damage. Engineer Terry Lively explained that the county must complete the work before being reimbursed with federal funds through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We borrowed that (money) to give us a head start on the slip repairs. The way the FEMA money works, once it finally gets authorized, we have to go out and make the repair, and they reimburse us for that. We weren t sure of the pace in which those projects would get approved. My concern was we were going to have a bunch of projects sitting here, ready to go, and not have the money to do the work up front. So I asked the commissioners to get a loan, using license plate fees as the payment, so we could get those projects rolling as quickly as possible, as soon as they get through the process and get approved by FEMA or Federal Highways. Lively said the money was borrowed for a period of one year and the loan had to be renewed. They pay back the whole 4 million, and then re borrow it, he said. There s interest to pay on that, but in my opinion it s well worth it to pay that interest, so that we have the flexibility to get on these slips as quickly as possible and get them repaired, he said. Lively said additional license plate fees approved by the commissioners several years ago generate about 800,000 annually. Using that money to pay the interest, pay the loan off, he said, adding the license plate funds will be used for street paving and guardrail repairs after the emergency damage is repaired. Once we get the slips done. He said the interest was about three percent. The annual interest payment is almost 120,000. In answer to the commissioners questions, Lively said the process remains a slow one. We re not getting things approved as quickly as we had hoped. We are getting things done, little by little, he said. He said four FEMA projects have been completed and two more have been approved, and one completed for Federal Highways. Lively said he hopes multiple Federal Highways projects will be approved at once. I think this is going to be a busy year as far as construction. We ll see a lot of things happening, at least on the Federal Highways side. On the FEMA side, we re still working our way through that red tape, he said. He said slips have been repaired on Belmont County Road 5, or Ramsey Ridge Road, near Alledonia Pleasant Ridge, south of Belmont and two on Fulton Hill in Pultney Township. We still have Road Closed signs up, because we have three other slips on Fulton Road. We re allowing local traffic through it, but we don t want big vehicles going through there, he said. He said slip repair for Blaine Chermont Road in Bridgeport has been bid out and utilities were were being relocated. Lively hopes the project will be done soon. It s completely out of our hands. We have to wait on the utility companies to move, he said. Mount Olivett Road in Barnesville is also close to approval. He said a slip on Crabapple Road in the St. Clairsville area has also been repaired. He said the projects that have been repairs are so far all from the 2018 disaster. The 2019 stuff is not even close to being ready yet, he said. Out of the 2018 disaster, we probably have 45 slips. Out of the 2019, we probably added another 20 to 25. Some of them have been rejected by FEMA so we re going to have to fix them as best we can. Lively said in a normal year, his office would deal with as many as five slips. We re used to that, but when we get hit with 40 to 50 of them in a year, it s overwhelming, he said. Afterward, he said he also applied for a grant through the new Oil and Shale Program through the Ohio Department of Transportation. It s designed to help the counties in this part of the state that are impacted by oil and gas activity. Most of those roads are covered by (road use maintenance) agreements, and this is specifically designed to help out roads that don t have a RUMA agreement on it, even though they re getting traffic, and they re getting damage, Lively said. I submitted an application back in October, we got a project approved down on Blaine Barton Road. It s a slip down there, and we got about 145,000 to repair that slip. He said the slip dates from prior to 2018 and was exacerbated by more recent wet weather. Work should begin 2021. Afterward, John Drewett of Lashley Hill Road, Shadyside, said his road continues to be closed due to two year old slips. In 2018, there was supposed to be money allotted for slips then, and we re behind. It s 2020 now, he said. Where (are we) on the list? There s no light at the end of the tunnel. I don t even see a tunnel. They re not catching up to 2018, how are we going to get things taken care of? This process has drug on, Dutton said.

Whitney Field,"Macy’s Is Closing 30 Stores in Early 2020 The Macy's department store at Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N. J. Update (Jan. 9, 2020) Macy s has confirmed another set of more than a dozen closures, bringing the total number of shutterings to roughly 30 stores. Over the next couple of months, the retailer expects to hold liquidation sales as it downsizes its fleet of brick and mortar outposts. One Bloomingdale s location is also scheduled to shut down. FN has provided a list of the closures below. What We Reported (Jan. 7, 2020): Macy s Is Closing More Than a Dozen Stores in Early 2020 Macy s is set to close more than a dozen stores early this year. The department store chain has confirmed the closures of 15 outposts across the country, including locations in shopping centers as well as free standing locations.

In a statement to FN, a spokesperson said that Macy s regularly review s our store portfolio and will provide an update on the store closures at its investor day on Feb. 5. The announcement comes less than two months after the company posted its third quarter earnings report ended Nov. 2, logging its first same store sales decline in two years and slashing its guidance for the full year. The Cincinnati based firm blamed the disappointing results on the warmer fall season, coupled with slowing foot traffic, amid a broader shift from brick and mortar to online retail. After seven consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth, we experienced a deceleration in our third quarter sales, Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette acknowledged in a statement. While we anticipated a negative comp because we were lapping a very strong third quarter last year, the sales deceleration was steeper than we expected. In the past few months, Macy s has been investing more resources in its e commerce mobile app, which it said is on track to exceed the goal of 1.5 billion in sales, as well as enhancing its website to promote online sales and drive in store visits. Although Gennette said on Nov. 21 that the retailer has confidence in our holiday strategies, Macy s has lowered its outlook, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of 2.57 to 2.77, below the previous guidance of 2.85 to 3.05. It also expects sales to be down 2.5% to 2.0%, versus the previous reading of approximately flat sales.

Leominster’s Mall at Whitney Field was sold for $16 million on Christmas Eve to Georgia retail real estate company The Mall at Whitney Field in Leominster was sold in December to a retail real estate company based in Georgia for 16 million, according to the Worcester Northern District Registry of Deeds. Property records show that Hull Property Group, based out of Augusta, Georgia, completed the purchase of 100 Commercial Street in Leominster on Dec. 24. Hull Property Group paid 14.4 million for the 744,000 square foot mall, and 1.6 million for personal property, according to deed records. Hull Property Group owns dozens of malls across the south, mid Atlantic and Midwest. The purchase of the Mall at Whitney Field is the company s first in New England, according to the group s website. The Mall at Whitney Field in Leominster opened in 1967 as the Searstown Mall and has faced the loss of a detached Toys ""R"" Us and the announcement that the mall s Sears would close as well. On Tuesday, Macy s announced it will close its store within the mall within three months. Macy s is one of nearly 70 stores listed on the mall s directory. In a statement to the Telegram and Gazette, Hull Property Group s Justin Smith said: This offering represented an exceptional opportunity to own all of The Mall at Whitney Field s anchor tenants, including a high volume Market Basket.  Macy's to Close 29 Stores as CEO Offers Reassurance Macy s Inc. , under scrutiny as department stores struggle to adapt to changes in the way consumers shop, rose in early trading after Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said the retailer s performance is improving. Macy s also said it will close 28 namesake stores and one Bloomingdale s in the coming weeks, while reducing some headcount at Bloomingdale s. Same store sales, a key metric of retailers success, fell 0.6% in November and December at company owned and licensed stores from a year earlier. Gennette said the holiday sales reflected a strong trend improvement from the third quarter. Macy s stock (M) was higher in early trading. The shares fell 43% last year. The rise suggests investors were already expecting lower comparable sales and were reassured by Gennette s comments. The decline in sales is nowhere near as bad as it could have been and represents a marked improvement from the dismal third quarter when comparable sales declined by 3.9%, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in emailed comments. The company said it will hold a meeting with investors on Feb. 5 in New York, where it will release a three year strategy. Macy s, which had the second worst performing stock in the S P 500 last year, has been closing underperforming stores amid working to reduce superfluous inventory for several years. The earnings news calmed fears of a more dramatic fall in the department store operator's numbers for the crucial annual shopping season after an earlier profit warning, Reuters explained. Macy's, which cut its annual profit forecast in November blaming weak international tourism and sluggish mall traffic, is among the first major corporate names to report sales for the holiday season seen as a barometer for the health of U. S. consumer spending. The company's holiday sales benefited from strong online sales and demand for gift products, Gennette said. U. S. consumers are increasingly spending more money online rather than traveling to physical stores during the holiday season, forcing traditional brick and mortar retailers to build their apps with more shopping and delivery options. U. S. e commerce sales in the period from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 18.8%, according to a Dec. 25 report by Mastercard Inc. , while overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose just 3.4%. The 0.6% reported drop at Macy's owned and licensed stores was for the months of November and December. The months make up the vast majority of fourth quarter comparable sales, which analysts had estimated to fall 1.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Meanwhile, compiled from various media reports, a list of some of Macy's stores closing in 2020: Connecticut Westfield Meriden Mall, Meriden Florida Pompano Citi Centre, Pompano Beach Seminole Towne Center, Sanford Indian River Mall, Vero Beach The Falls, Miami Bloomingdales Georgia The Gallery at South DeKalb, Decatur Macon Mall, Macon Idaho Lewiston Center Mall, Lewiston Illinois University Mall, Carbondale Spring Hill Mall, West Dundee Indiana Muncie Mall, Muncie Kansas Prairie Village Shopping Center, Prairie Village Kentucky Towne Square Mall, Owensboro Maryland The Centre at Salisbury, Salisbury Massachusetts The Mall at Whitney Field, Leominster Montana Northside Center, Helena North Carolina Hanes Mall, Winston Salem Ohio Northgate Mall, Greater Cincinnati Ohio Valley Mall, St. Clairsville Stow Kent Plaza, Stow Pennsylvania Harrisburg Mall, Harrisburg Nittany Mall, State College Tennessee Rivergate Mall, Goodlettsville Washington Cascade Mall, Burlington Downtown Seattle, Seattle Downtown Walla Walla, Walla Walla Material from Reuters and Bloomberg has been used in this report.

Eastwood Mall,"New anchor store coming to Eastwood Mall NILES The Cafaro Company will announce Monday the national retailer that will occupy the massive former Sears, but speculation about the mall s new anchor is that it will be Boscov s department store. Neither Joe Bell, director of corporate communications for Cafaro Company , nor Jacob Stein, senior vice president of corporate communications for Boscov s, would confirm the Reading, Pa. based chain is opening a store in Niles but there are strong hints of that partnership. Cafaro Company officials plan next week to provide details of one of the biggest announcements ever made by the company regarding the mall s future, according to a news release Friday, the same day Boscov s posted a second clue to its Facebook page regarding a big announcement it plans to make Monday. Bell said the retailer has a large presence in the mid Atlantic and Northeast markets and will be the biggest retailer to open its doors inside the mall. When all is said and done, this will be in excess of 180,000 square feet, Bell said. Said Jim Boscov, chairman and CEO of Boscov s: I will give you all of the details on Monday. Demolition work has been happening inside the former Sears as crews have been removing the top nine inches of floor for asbestos, according to a permit granted Nov. 6 by the building department in Niles. The store will inhabit the 119,900 square foot space of the former Sears and more, including the 25,800 square foot Tilt Studio, which closed when its lease ended Dec. 31. In addition, several stores in that concourse will be relocated inside the mall to make way for the new retailer. They include A Nails salon, Dafffin s Candies and St. Joe s at the Mall. Boscov s operates 49 stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, according to its website. Its largest presence is in Pennsylvania, where it has 26 stores. It already has partnerships with Cafaro Company at its Ohio Valley Mall in St. Clairsville the only Boscov s in Ohio and at Mill Creek Mall in Erie, Pa. , where it occupies the former Sears. The chain opened its first store in 1918 in Reading, Pa. Four years prior, its founder, Solomon Boscov, settled in Reading from Russia and began selling household goods to farmers, according to the company s website. rselak tribtoday. com Boscov’s is confirmed at Eastwood NILES Cafaro Company boasts on its corporate website that the company s Ohio Valley Mall in St. Clairsville has the only Boscov s department store in Ohio. The company s going to have to get its tech people to change that it won t be accurate come the fall. October ish is when the Reading, Pa. based, family owned Boscov s is planning to open inside the massive former Sears at the Eastwood Mall, officials from Boscov s and the Cafaro Company have confirmed. The store will be Boscov s third in a Cafaro Company owned mall. The other is at Mill Creek Mall in Erie, Pa. Coincidentally, it also occupies a former Sears store. We open one store a year, so we are very selective, and this has been on the radar for many years, said Jacob Stein, senior vice president of corporate communications, real estate and maintenance for Boscov s. All of the stars kind of aligned in the last couple years that allowed this to become a real opportunity. An official announcement is planned for 11 a. m. today at the mall. It will end months of speculation surrounding just what retailer will occupy the space after Sears closed in late 2018 following bankruptcy by parent company Sears Holdings. Geography and demographics are two of the three key factors that led to Boscov s decision to open at the mall, Stein said. The other was the company s desire to partner with other family owned companies, which the Cafaro Company is, and the Cafaro Company s willingness to invest and maintain its properties in addition to its contributions to the community. You add all of those things together and that lines up to be a good opportunity for us to pursue, Stein said. We ve been looking at it for over five years. Said Joe Bell, director of corporate communications for Cafaro Company, Quite honestly, there are great parallels between his (Boscov s) and ours in terms of the way we work together, the values we hold. We have found working with Boscov s has really been a wonderful experience, not just for us, but for all of the people we serve in the various communities we serve. Boscov s, which has 49 stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, was founded in 1914 by Solomon Boscov, who settled in Reading, Pa. , from Russia and began selling household goods to farmers in the area. He opened his first retail store in 1918. The company grew through the decades and embarked on an aggressive expansion in the 2000s, but became overleveraged and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. It s former CEO, Solomon Boscov s son, Al, came out of retirement to get the company back on its feet by securing private financing and government backed loans to keep it afloat. Successfully navigating bankruptcy, Boscov s continues to expand, but at a much slower pace. This latest expansion is into a market where the company is relatively unknown, but has a core local customer base the company has found will travel to stores in St. Clairsville and in Pennsylvania. We already have a good handful of customers residing within a few miles of Niles, that Mahoning Valley market, that are shopping with us at those other stores so they are making a very long drive, which was one of the biggest points of evidence to us that this was an exciting opportunity, that this community is already making a commitment to drive very far to shop with us in our other stores, and that traditionally has been a good indicator of success, Stein said. If that community is will to drive to you, they re asking for you to come. That is their way of saying please come. Demolition work has been happening inside the former Sears to prepare the space for Boscov s. Crews have been removing the top nine inches of floor for asbestos, according to a permit granted Nov. 6 by the building department in Niles, and the site is about ready to turn over to Boscov s contractors to complete the store s build out, Bell said. The store will inhabit the 119,900 square foot space of the former Sears and more, including the 25,800 square foot Tilt Studio, which closed when its lease ended Dec. 31. In addition, several stores in that concourse will be relocated inside the mall to make way for the new retailer. They include A Nails salon, Dafffin s Candies and St. Joe s at the Mall. The Niles Boscov s will employ about 300 full and part time employees.  Orchids and onions  ORCHID: To members of the Martin Luther King Jr. Planning Committee of Mahoning County that hosted this week s MLK Day program, themed Remembering What is Civil and Doing What is Right.

While she was showing signs of hypothermia, her injuries apparently were not serious. ONION: To the private ambulance provider that was unable to respond in Youngstown because it had no ambulances available. Luckily, firefighters were able to use a private van to transport the girl to the local hospital. There always should be a backup plan for ambulance service. This incident could have been so much worse. Now, Youngstown Mayor Jamael Tito Brown says the city s ambulance company will add two more ambulances into service full time, reducing risk of not being able to respond to an emergency.

(special notice) Demolition largely completed for Birmingham’s Century Plaza Century Plaza is officially gone. In just two months, the state s once largest mall has been razed and construction for a new Amazon distribution center is about to begin. Posted by al. com on Monday, January 4, 2021 Birmingham s Century Plaza, once the largest mall in Alabama, is no more. Demolition work began in November on the once bustling Birmingham shopping mall, which will become an Amazon distribution center. As the 2020 holiday season ended, most of the surviving structure was no longer visible at the old mall site. The property sold in November ahead of its planned redevelopment. On AL. com s Facebook account, the news was met with a mix of sadness and nostalgia. Connie Johnson Brasher wrote, Sad to see this totally gone. So many memories growing up. Eric M. Dunklin remembered buying my first pair of Nikes with my deceased Dad GOD rest his soul. Jay Battle, however, wrote, I m here for it! Although my memories of the mall is 20 years old. its time to upgrade the East Side. jobs development. Once home to more than 100 stores, Century Plaza will be razed to make way for a 60 million, 200,000 square foot Amazon center, with construction expected to begin quickly. Lumpkin Development owned the mall for the past two years. Since its closing, various plans for the property s redevelopment were floated but didn t quite materialize, such as converting it to storage space or a church. Mercedes Benz briefly parked newly manufactured cars there last year while dealing with production issues. 14 The demolition of Century Plaza in Birmingham See inside Century Plaza The Amazon center is expected to bring 300 full time jobs and more than 1,000 part time jobs. Packages destined to be delivered will arrive boxed and ready for van delivery to addresses across the Birmingham area. Birmingham s Century Plaza through the years The 750,000 square foot Century Plaza first opened in 1975 and was a mainstay of Birmingham s retail landscape through the end of the century, situated near the now demolished Eastwood Mall. Century Plaza hosted special events, including toy shows and modeling contests and is remembered for its holiday decorations. Memories of Alabama malls include food, fun, friends 13 Century Plaza demolition 1 4 2021 But over time, neighborhoods began springing up to the south and east of the city, along with other shopping options, such as Hoover s Riverchase Galleria and Trussville s Colonial Pinnacle at Tutwiler Farm. The slow decline of the enclosed shopping center, a national phenomenon given the rise of online shopping, was then accelerated by the recession of 2008. Sears, the first store to open, was the last retailer to close, in 2009.  Century Plaza remembered: Vintage photos of demolished Birmingham mall For generations of Alabamians, it is forever Christmas inside the walls of Birmingham s Century Plaza. From memories of last minute shopping, to whispers in Santa s ear, to Jingles the Talking Bear, mentioning the now gone shopping mall on Birmingham s eastside inevitably brings up visions of Yuletide cheer for longtime residents and those who came to the Magic City to find the right gifts. And so, it s probably appropriate if a bit melancholy that the end of the 2020 holiday season also saw the completion of demolition at Century Plaza. And there were more than likely a few stunned people to find that, when crews tore down the walls, there weren t still strings of lights and Santa s throne inside, and a Poinsettia Christmas tree, waiting for shoppers who would never return. A 1975 aerial view of Eastwood Mall and Century Plaza. The 25 million, 700,000 square foot Century Plaza, which opened in the mid 70s, was once home to more than 100 stores. There were anchors like JC Penney, Pizitz, Loveman s, Rich s, Sears, McRae s. But there were also much loved favorites, like Gentry Coins and Stamps, Hot Sam, Karmelkorn, Fox Photo. You could grab a Big Mac at McDonald s or a slice of pizza at Sbarro s, pick up a movie on videocassette at Video Concepts or Camelot Music, or a book at B. Dalton. There was cheese and summer sausage at Hickory Farms, or the chicken at The Dragon. Girls got their first ear piercings at Merle Norman. Children took in the giant Lego displays. Would be drivers learned to park outside on the weekends, their parents fumbling awkwardly for the brake from the passenger seat. Or you could sit down inside at the many water fountains and just hang out, as many teenagers did during the Reagan years. In a 2019 piece on Malls for AL. com, Daniel Pope and Michael Allen, who were teenagers from Gadsden in the 1980s, remembered being left behind at Century Plaza while in town for a school field trip. My mom had to come pick us up, Pope said. Can you imagine if that happened today? Century Plaza was the kind of prototypical enclosed shopping mall that proliferated across the U. S. throughout the 70s and 80s until online retail and changing habits from shoppers signaled a shift. This Birmingham News photo from 1976, the year after Century Plaza opened, shows off televisions available for sale at JC Penney's at Century Plaza store. The photo caption from that year said the store ""will have at least 22 different models. Would you believe 22 channels?"" Sears, the first store to open, was the last retailer to close, in 2009. Over time, neighborhoods began springing up to the south and east of the city, along with other shopping options such as Hoover s Riverchase Galleria and Trussville s Colonial Pinnacle at Tutwiler Farm. It took a little less than two months to raze the old mall, which will make way for a 60 million, 200,000 square foot Amazon center, with construction expected to begin quickly. The demolition, which began in November, led to the formation of Friends of Century Plaza, a Facebook group that acts as a kind of time capsule, preserving memories and images from the old mall. Among those sharing memories was Christy Pitts Lee, who recalled working in mall management at Century Plaza when it hosted Pet Photo with Santa events. We were the only mall around that did this and it was challenging to say the least, Lee said. The last few years, it got to the point were we could only do dogs and cats because people brought the craziest animals. While I m doing media interviews, I m also having to keep an ear out on my radio. We stationed security at the entrances and my radio would go off non stop. We ve got a goat at entrance 2. nope. We ve got a pot belly pig at entrance 4. nope. We ve got a 7 foot albino python at entrance 3. Hell naw. escort that person to their car and follow them off property until they re at least 10 miles away! This Birmingham News file photo shows some of the highlights of Century Plaza's JC Penney before it opened in 1975. The Western Shop offered everything from hats to saddles. Pam McCullar Measal, worked as the mall s marketing manager in the early 90s. She remembered a brainstorm involving Jingles the Bear and the arrival of Santa. It is always difficult to find creative ways to make Christmas magical, she said. My thought was to have Jingles sleeping, and the power of the children ringing their bells that is another story in itself and screaming to wake up Jingles would be the plan for Santa s arrival. I produced a soundtrack of Jingles snoring. However, the snoring sounded to some as though Santa had gas, she said. Shoppers browse through Century Plaza on Monday, Dec. 13, 2004. (Jacquelyn Martin)ph But Century Plaza wasn t just open at Christmas time. Matt Redmond remembered a celebrity encounter at the mall when he worked at Things Remembered around 1991. I had worked my way up to doing the engraving, Redmond said. Often people would watch as I worked. Eventually you got used to being watched and you didn t notice it. Except one day I noticed a large round object in front of me. I looked up and it was a clock. However, it was Flava Flav from the rap group Public Enemy, in town for a concert, wearing his trademark clock around his neck, his entourage in tow. Here are more vintage images and stories of Alabama s past . He said That s cool, and walked off. I had no idea who he was because I was probably listening to REM or the Smiths, Redmond said. One legendary date in Alabama history stood out March 12, 1993, the opening salvo of a blizzard that crippled the state and the Birmingham area, dumping about 13 inches of snow in some areas. Amy Barlow, an employee at Rich s, remembered going to the store to pick up her paycheck. I was in college, Barlow said. It looked like a normal day. I went home to my dad and neighbors cutting firewood in the woods. It was such a lovely day, I thought they were crazy. Little did I know! This file photo from the Birmingham News shows J. C. Penny's at Century Plaza store days before it opened in 1975. The store featured furniture, appliances and a wide variety of clothing for all age groups. It was JC Penney's 19th Alabama store. The store closed in 2006. Jessica Dexter worked at the India Shoppe that same day, waiting for the mall to close. Eventually it did, while the sun was still out. By the time they let us out the Interstate already had snow piled up, Dexter said. Though shopping destinations come and go, and teenagers find new places to make their memories, for many, Century Plaza will always occupy a corner of their imaginations. Gaddy Cole, writing on Facebook, summed it up. I used to think this place was a palace, he said.

Tri County Mall,"Police: Man exposed himself at Deerfield Twp. Graeter's. Did the same previously at Tri-County Mall A Miami County man was arrested New Year's Day after he exposed himself to kids at a Deerfield Township Graeter's, officials said. Robert W. Cost, 60, is charged with indecent exposure, according to court records. He is currently being held on a 75,000 bond at the Warren County Jail. Cost is accused of exposing his genitalia to two juveniles at a Deerfield Township Graeter's store on Dec. 29, according to a release from the Warren County Sheriff's Office. He was arrested at a Buffalo Wild Wings on New Year's Day. Officials said Cost has been arrested by other agencies several times for the same type of offense.

Cost admitted to the offense when approached by an off duty officer at the mall and said he had driven down from his home in Sidney, Ohio and stopped at Tri County Mall for the sole purpose of exposing himself to women. He said he sat at the food court with shorts on and opened his legs so women could see his genitalia, according to court records. According to court documents, Cost told Springdale officers he ""gets sexually excited about younger adult woman looking at his genitalia"" and that he has done this same thing multiple times at Tri County Mall and other malls. Cost will appear in court on Jan. 7, according to court records.  Macy's to close Northgate Mall location this spring Macy s Northgate Mall location will close in early spring, the company announced Monday, joining a fleet of other brick and mortar casualties in the company's battle with a rapidly changing retail industry. The decision to close a store is always a difficult one, but Macy s is proud to have served our customers in the Cincinnati community at Macy s Northgate over the past 27 years, and we look forward to continuing to do so at nearby Macy s stores, a company spokesperson wrote in a statement. The Northgate location will begin selling inventory at a discount this month and continue for up to four months before closing permanently. Some employees (the spokesperson did not specify how many) will be transferred to other Macy s stores in the Cincinnati area. The rest will receive severance packages. The company will continue to operate stores at Macy s Tri County Mall, Macy s Kenwood Towne Centre, Macy s Florence Mall and Macy s Anderson Towne Center. Macy's declined to confirm other store closures, but local media outlets in seven other cities published reports today about closures in six states. Macy's told the Cafaro Company it will close about 20 stores this year, according to spokesman Joe Bell. Cafaro's location at Ohio Valley Mall in St. Clairsville was among the closures. ""It was the only Macy's location between Columbus and Pittsburgh,"" Bell said. Macy s, which is headquartered in Cincinnati, closed its iconic Fountain Place department store in March 2018. That closure was one of 100 across the company, which CEO Jeffrey Gennette said he hoped would make the business leaner and allow reinvestment in other areas. That September, he told analysts he anticipated entering 2019 with an eye on rebuilding the business in other forms: Discount stores and pop ups, among other options, instead of traditional department stores. By late November 2019, the company was in trouble again. Macy s posted earnings of around 2 million a penny per share and cut its profit and sales expectations for the year, partially blaming weak mall traffic and website problems. We ve been investing in malls where developers are investing,"" Macy's President Hal Lawton told investors in November. ""Those stores continue to outpace the rest of our fleet. "" But Lawton also hinted that store closures might be coming in malls that haven't seen major upgrades in recent years. ""We ve been watching the trend across our malls for quite some time, specifically in the C and D malls, which are our neighborhood doors,"" he said. ""And we did see a steeper decline that we d anticipated in the quarter.

SHE S 31 NOW. SHE WAS 18 WHEN SHE WAS VICTIMIZED IN THE FOOD COURT AT THE TRI COUNTY MALL. I REALIZED HE WAS LIKE ACTING KIND OF FUNNY, HE WAS READING A NEWSPAPER.

IN 2018, HE WAS BUSTED AGAIN, AT THREE DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS IN THE COLUMBUS AREA. SENTENCES INCLUDED PROBATION AND COUNSELING. PUBLIC INDECENCY IS SOMETIMES DISCOUNTED AS A SERIOUS OFFENSE. KARIN: BECAUSE, USUALLY IT S A MISDEMEANOR. DEFENSE ATTORNEY JASON PHILLABAUM DOES NOT REPRESEN COST, BUT IS HELPING US GET ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS. T WHY HASN T COST HAD TO SERVE ANY HARD TIME DESPITE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS? IF YOU RE DOING SOMETHING IN CINCINNATI AND THEN DAYTON AND THEN BUTLER COUNTY AND THEN WARREN COUNTY, AND KENTUCK YOU RE BOUNCING ALL THESE OTHER COURTS AND TO THEM YOU RE JUST FIRST TIME FIRST APPEARANCE SO, THAT IS HOW SOMETIMES IT IS EASY TO SQUEAK AND FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.

I WANT TO BE CLEAR THOUGH WHILE HE HAS NOT BEEN INDICTED OR CONVICTED IN WARREN COUNTY AS OF TONIGHT. Advertisement Woman victimized as a teen: 'My stomach dropped' when learning of suspect's latest arrest Share Copy Link Copy A man accused of exposing himself to underage girls inside the Deerfield Township Graeter's has been indicted for similar crimes in the past. In 2007, Robert Cost, 60, of Miami County, was convicted of indecent exposure. WLWT spoke exclusively with the victim in that case. She asked only to be identified by her first name, Johnna. She said she was shocked to hear the man who victimized her more than a decade ago was arrested again. ""I mean, my stomach dropped a little because it's kind of sad to know that he's still out there doing this,"" Johnna said. Johnna is 31 years old now but was 18 at the time she encountered Cost inside the food court at the Tri County Mall. ""I realized he was like acting kind of funny. He was reading a newspaper. He had a hat on, and all of a sudden, he kind of started shaking his legs in and out,"" Johnna said. She said Cost pulled his shorts over one one side and exposed his genitals to Johnna, her friend and Johnna's younger sister. ""My little sister was only 13, so he was blatantly exposing himself to a child,"" Johnna said. ""Then I realized he was actually doing it to try and get a reaction from us, and I learned later that he had a camera actually in his ball cap to tape our reaction. ""The teenagers told security guards. Cost was arrested and convicted. Court documents filed with that case showed he had been previously convicted of the same crime in Miami County in 1981. In 2014, West Chester police arrested Cost after he exposed himself to two juveniles at a Barnes and Noble book store. In 2018, he was arrested three more times in a span of five months for exposing himself to at three different restaurants in the Columbus area. All of his sentences included probation and counseling. Jason Phillabaum is a local defense attorney. He does not represent Cost, but Phillabaum is helping WLWT get answers to questions many of you had, such as, 'Why hasn't Cost had to serve any hard time despite multiple convictions?'""If you go back to the same court, the judge and the prosecutor and the police are going to recognize you, but if you're doing something in Cincinnati and then Dayton and then Butler County and then Warren County and Kentucky, you're bouncing to all these other courts, and to them you're just a first time, first appearance, so that's how sometimes it's easy to fall through the cracks,"" Phillabaum said. He said many courts are not on the same system. Phillabaum also said public indecency is also sometimes discounted as a serious offense. In Cost's previous cases, he was convicted of misdemeanors. The charge out of Warren County is a felony. ""I think in this case, what you've seen is the Warren County Sheriff's Office and prosecutors office actually really do their research, looked at the statute and were able to escalate this to a felony,"" Phillabaum said. ""In this case, you have the Warren County Sheriff's Office who looked and found his priors and said, 'Hey, it's got to stop here. '""If convicted, Phillabaum said he expects the turnout will be different this time around. ""If he gets indicted and convicted, he is facing prison time and a sex offender status,"" Phillabaum said. ""There's a couple things that the judge can do. One, he could just sent him to prison for a maximum of 12 months, just send him away and keep him out of society for a year because he's a danger. The other possibility is putting him on probation for five years, so he could hold prison over his head. """"He's a sick man. He needs help, and I really hope that he has to register as an offender,"" Johnna said. Cost also has a misdemeanor indecent exposure case pending in Boone County, Kentucky. Last Sept. , Florence police arrest him at a Steak 'n Shake. Investigators say he exposed himself to young women inside the restaurant. In both the Florence and Deerfield Township cases, investigators said he had a camera on him that was disguised as a pen.  New restaurant coming to closed O’Charley’s space in West Chester WEST CHESTER TOWNSHIP, Ohio The Journal News reports an O Charley s restaurant that closed last year at 7866 Tylersville Square Dr. in West Chester Township will be replaced by Million's Crab Boiled Seafood in mid February, according to Commi Tong, the chain s marketing director. The company, which is looking to hire servers, line cooks and dish washers, is the brainchild of two Cajun seafood chains: Juicy Seafood Naked Crab, Tong said. Million s Crab s menu includes cajun seafood such as Snow Crab legs, King Crab legs, clams, oysters, mussels, shrimp and more. It specializes in boiling fresh seafood in Cajun seasoning and topping it with a choice of sauces including garlic butter, cajun, lemon pepper, Million s Sauce or Szechuan. It also offers an array of American cuisines dishes like burgers, wings and pasta, plus soups, salads, appetizers, sandwiches, lamb, beef, lobster, salmon and various other dishes, plus beers and cider. Million s Crab has a location in Pennsylvania. In addition to the new location in Butler County s West Chester Twp. , is planning to open restaurants at 3324 Benchwood Road in Dayton, 2206 N. Bechtle Ave. in Springfield and 11700 Princeton Pike in Springdale at the Tri County Mall, as well as locations in Toledo and Middletown, Kentucky. The Journal News is a media partner of WCPO 9 News.  Macy's Inc. will close Tri-County Mall store by April CINCINNATI Macy's Inc. will close its Tri County Mall location by April of this year as part of a national strategy to withdraw from weaker shopping malls. The company said the closure will follow a clearance sale that begins this month and runs about eight to 12 weeks. Regular, non seasonal colleagues will be eligible for severance if they're unable to be placed in the company's remaining stores in Kenwood, Florence and Anderson Township. ""The decision to close a store is always a difficult one but Macy's Tri County Mall is honored to have served our customers and the community over the past 60 years,"" said Macy's spokeswoman Carolyn Ng Cohen. It's the third store closure in four years for Macy's in Greater Cincinnati, which lost its Downtown store in 2018 and Northgate Mall in 2020. Also last year, the company announced it would close its Downtown headquarters as part of a national restructuring. RELATED: Macy's impact on Cincinnati The Tri County closure is part of a three year plan to eliminate 125 locations nationwide, as Macy's focuses its store fleet on shopping centers with higher occupancy rates and more pedestrian traffic. The WCPO I Team ranked Tri County as the region's second most endangered mall in February of last year, after an analysis that compared retail properties on vacancy rates, financial health and prospects for redevelopment.  Macy’s to close at Tri-County Mall CINCINNATI (FOX19) Macy s will close its store at Tri County Mall in Springdale this year, the company said Wednesday. A Macy s spokeswoman tells FOX19 NOW the closure is part of the company s strategy to pull out of weaker malls. A full list of stores the company plans to close will be posted to the company s website later Wednesday. The decision to close a store is always a difficult one, but Macy s Tri County Mall is honored to have served our customers and the community over the past 60 years, and we look forward to continuing to do so at Macy s Anderson Town Center, Macy s Florence and Macy s Kenwood Towne Centre locations and online at macys. com or on the Macy s app, the company said in a statement. Regular, non seasonal colleagues who we are unable to place at nearby Macy s stores will be eligible for severance, including outplacement resources. A clearance sale will begin in January and run for approximately 8 12 weeks. This will be the third Macy s store to shut down locally in the past few years. The store in downtown Cincinnati shut down in 2018, and Northgate Mall shuttered last year. Macy s also announced last year it planned to close its headquarters in downtown Cincinnati as part of a national restructuring. Macy s pulling out of Tri County Mall will leave the shopping center at Ohio 747 and Kemper Road just south of Interstate 275 without a major department store anchor. The mall opened in 1960 and has been expanded several times, most notably in 1992 when the second level was added along with a fourth anchor store. The shopping center, however, has undergone a slow decline in recent years with all the other major department store anchors J. C. Penney, Dillards and Sears leaving.

As Tri-County Mall loses Macy's, can the mall itself survive? SPRINGDALE, Ohio The Tri County Mall will lose a major anchor business as Macy's Inc. announces it will close its location in the mall by April as part of a national strategy to withdraw from weaker shopping malls. City leaders said they think the loss could provide some clarity for the property's future. ""There's no question that it's coronavirus pandemic sped up that decline of brick and mortar, and the changes that have been ongoing for the past decade are only going to accelerate,"" said Andy Kuchta, director of economic development for the City of Springdale. Major retailers have been facing challenges for years: Macy's announced in Feb. 2020, when they closed their corporate headquarters in downtown Cincinnati, that the business would adopt a new strategy that incorporated heavier online sales and fewer brick and mortar sites. The WCPO I Team has reported on the Tri County Mall in the past, evaluating vacancy rates, financial health and prospects for redevelopment. The mall ranks as the second most endangered in the Tri State region. ""Nobody here at the city was surprised about the announcement,"" said Kuchta. ""Obviously, everybody is disappointed. "" The City of Springdale expected Macy's to eventually leave the Tri County Mall, particularly after two other locations have closed in the region in the past four years. Instead of holding out hope to maintain a traditional shopping mall, however, the city said it leaves the owner no choice but to sell or develop the property. ""You re not going to re tenant the existing mall. It has to be something new. It has to be something different,"" said Kuchta. ""From that standpoint we ve actually got a very clear picture moving forward. "" The COVID 19 pandemic has also contributed to changing the way people shop and what they're spending their money on, but whether that impact will continue to affect the retail industry long term is still unclear. ""There s been really significant winners and losers,"" said Janet Harrah, an economist at Northern Kentucky University. ""The real question we don t know at this point, it s much too early to know, is how will it all settle out once the pandemic is over?"" The City of Springdale expects the owners of the mall will sell the property now that Macy's has added its name to the list of stores that have decided to leave. City officials hope a new developer will turn the property into a mixed use space with shopping, restaurants and housing.

Blaine Barton Road,"Loan renewed for Belmont slip repairs ST. CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County s board of commissioners heard an update on road slip repair Wednesday. Commissioners Josh Meyer, J. P. Dutton and Jerry Echemann renewed a 4 million loan to pay part of the cost of repairing, constructing and reconstructing roads in the county. The commissioners also approved Dinsmore Shohl LLP to act as bond counsel. A federal disaster was declared for the local area last February. According to the county engineer s office, Belmont County sustained close to 12 million worth of road damage. Engineer Terry Lively explained that the county must complete the work before being reimbursed with federal funds through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We borrowed that (money) to give us a head start on the slip repairs. The way the FEMA money works, once it finally gets authorized, we have to go out and make the repair, and they reimburse us for that. We weren t sure of the pace in which those projects would get approved. My concern was we were going to have a bunch of projects sitting here, ready to go, and not have the money to do the work up front. So I asked the commissioners to get a loan, using license plate fees as the payment, so we could get those projects rolling as quickly as possible, as soon as they get through the process and get approved by FEMA or Federal Highways. Lively said the money was borrowed for a period of one year and the loan had to be renewed. They pay back the whole 4 million, and then re borrow it, he said. There s interest to pay on that, but in my opinion it s well worth it to pay that interest, so that we have the flexibility to get on these slips as quickly as possible and get them repaired, he said. Lively said additional license plate fees approved by the commissioners several years ago generate about 800,000 annually. Using that money to pay the interest, pay the loan off, he said, adding the license plate funds will be used for street paving and guardrail repairs after the emergency damage is repaired. Once we get the slips done. He said the interest was about three percent. The annual interest payment is almost 120,000. In answer to the commissioners questions, Lively said the process remains a slow one. We re not getting things approved as quickly as we had hoped. We are getting things done, little by little, he said. He said four FEMA projects have been completed and two more have been approved, and one completed for Federal Highways. Lively said he hopes multiple Federal Highways projects will be approved at once. I think this is going to be a busy year as far as construction. We ll see a lot of things happening, at least on the Federal Highways side. On the FEMA side, we re still working our way through that red tape, he said. He said slips have been repaired on Belmont County Road 5, or Ramsey Ridge Road, near Alledonia Pleasant Ridge, south of Belmont and two on Fulton Hill in Pultney Township. We still have Road Closed signs up, because we have three other slips on Fulton Road. We re allowing local traffic through it, but we don t want big vehicles going through there, he said. He said slip repair for Blaine Chermont Road in Bridgeport has been bid out and utilities were were being relocated. Lively hopes the project will be done soon. It s completely out of our hands. We have to wait on the utility companies to move, he said. Mount Olivett Road in Barnesville is also close to approval. He said a slip on Crabapple Road in the St. Clairsville area has also been repaired. He said the projects that have been repairs are so far all from the 2018 disaster. The 2019 stuff is not even close to being ready yet, he said. Out of the 2018 disaster, we probably have 45 slips. Out of the 2019, we probably added another 20 to 25. Some of them have been rejected by FEMA so we re going to have to fix them as best we can. Lively said in a normal year, his office would deal with as many as five slips. We re used to that, but when we get hit with 40 to 50 of them in a year, it s overwhelming, he said. Afterward, he said he also applied for a grant through the new Oil and Shale Program through the Ohio Department of Transportation. It s designed to help the counties in this part of the state that are impacted by oil and gas activity. Most of those roads are covered by (road use maintenance) agreements, and this is specifically designed to help out roads that don t have a RUMA agreement on it, even though they re getting traffic, and they re getting damage, Lively said. I submitted an application back in October, we got a project approved down on Blaine Barton Road. It s a slip down there, and we got about 145,000 to repair that slip. He said the slip dates from prior to 2018 and was exacerbated by more recent wet weather. Work should begin 2021. Afterward, John Drewett of Lashley Hill Road, Shadyside, said his road continues to be closed due to two year old slips. In 2018, there was supposed to be money allotted for slips then, and we re behind. It s 2020 now, he said. Where (are we) on the list? There s no light at the end of the tunnel. I don t even see a tunnel. They re not catching up to 2018, how are we going to get things taken care of? This process has drug on, Dutton said. The incident in 2018 was very significant, followed by an incident in 2019, which affected these sites from 2018, which grew in scope and had to be re evaluated. We re as frustrated as everyone else. The engineer just can t go out and start doing these projects. He ll be bankrupt by the end of the week, Meyer said.  Belmont Co. officials sworn in to office ST. CLAIRSVILLE New and incumbent officials took office for 2021, with several sworn in as a group Thursday morning at the courthouse before Belmont County Common Pleas Judge Frank Fregiato. Belmont County Commissioner Josh Meyer was sworn in later that day and could not be reached for comment, but J. P. Dutton, who also successfully defended his seat in the November election, said the commissioners will pursue plans that were stalled by the COVID 19 pandemic. Plans got put on hold fairly quickly once March hit and the pandemic hit. It really was part of every conversation from that point on through the end of the year, he said, adding although many have taken an economic hit, the county remains in a stable position. In 2021, I think it s time to re evaluate where things are. We know most likely federal and state assistance has ended at this point, Dutton said. Major projects on the horizon include determining a new location for storage of county records, now housed in an old building on Oak View Road. Breaking ground for major water and sewer upgrades is also expected. Dutton said he is also optimistic that a possible ethane cracker plant along Ohio 7 in southern Belmont County, put on hold indefinitely by PTT Global Chemical America due to the pandemic, will become a reality and a benefit to the area. Dutton said another major project to be considered is an expansion to the Belmont County Jail. Prior to the pandemic, the inmate population at the 144 bed facility had been close to 200 and the commissioners housed some inmates outside of the county at a cost. We know there s a long term trend of our facility being undersized, he said. Sheriff David Lucas, also sworn in, said he will continue to work with the county commissioners to determine how to address overcrowding at the county jail, whether through an expansion or an additional building. We need to get all the studies done, get the plans done, and decide what we ve got to do on the expansion and then move forward with it, Lucas said. Meanwhile, the major crimes unit will continue its work He gives credit to the staff and deputies. 2020 was a tough year for everybody. We re looking forward to 2021 and making plans, he said. I d like to thank the community for trusting me with another term as sheriff. Juvenile and Probate Judge Al Davies said his court and related programs were busy helping youth and families. We continue to offer programming designed to strengthen the foundation of our kids and our families. Belmont County Staying Clean has been working through the pandemic. It s survived and growing strong. Our parent project has been a big success for helping parents with children who have some challenges. We re getting good results from that program now that we re starting back up again with our spring class in March. Our probation officers continue to do phenomenal work, he said. Davies said although the annual car show fundraiser was unable to proceed due to the pandemic, generous donors still contributed and he expects the event will resume in 2021. Fiscally, it s on solid ground, Davies said. One thing that was missing is we do sign a lot of kids up at that car show, so we weren t able to do that this year, he said. Amanda Fisher, newly elected to county coroner also thanks the voters. I am really looking forward to serving Belmont County as the new coroner, she said, adding she is continuing to strengthen lines of communication with law enforcement, funeral directors, and first responders. With COVID there have been a lot of changes with the way deaths are handled moving forward with the uncertainty of how COVID s going to play out in 2021, I m not sure what temporary or permanent changes may occur in the coroner s office, but I m ready for any of those challenges, she said. A lot of the COVID deaths will be handled in the nursing homes or the hospital settings, but I do anticipate every year unfortunately it seems there is an increase in the overdose deaths, she said. In general there has been more of a demand on the coroner s office due to the opioid epidemic in our county. Engineer Terry Lively said his office will keep looking into acquiring funding. He hopes the worst of the pandemic is past, but speculated less state and federal funding available. It s just too early to say, he said. It s of course impossible to predict what s going to happen in 2021, but I m optimistic, he said. We ve been successful here lately in applying for some grant funding, so we ve got some projects coming this year. Lively pointed out a coming slip repair on Blaine Barton Road, paid for by a shale and oil grant, and another shale and oil grant will go toward paving the road in 2022. Lively s office is also seeking Ohio Public Works funding for repairs on Colerain Pike. Meanwhile, ongoing repair work from prior years continues. We re still cleaning up 2018 and 2019 disaster projects, Lively said. There s a lot going on.

CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County is preparing for the upcoming 2020 census in April. On Wednesday, Commissioners J. P. Dutton, Josh Meyer and Jerry Echemann appointed the Rev. William Webster of Grace Presbyterian Church in Martins Ferry as chairman for the Belmont County Complete County Committee for 2020. The committee s first meeting will be held at 4 p. m. Jan. 22 at the church. Anyone interested in learning how to participate and ensure everyone is counted may attend. The commissioners pointed out a complete and accurate count is necessary for an equitable share of financial assistance and representation. I m sure we ll discuss it more as we get into the spring. We really appreciate Rev. Webster volunteering to chair that temporary committee, Dutton said. This the first time I ll be heading up the census for Belmont County, Webster said afterward, adding that he is meeting with the mayor Martins Ferry. I m trying to organize different groups and different people in every community so that everyone in our community gets counted. There s a lot at stake in the census. Federal and state funding is a big issue. There s nine questions and it takes about eight minutes, but it ll affect our community for the next 10 years. An annual population estimate from the federal governmentindicated that, in 2019, Belmont County s population has decreased by an average annual rate of change of 0.05 percent. In 2017, Belmont County had a population of 67,956. The latest population estimates show Belmont County at 67,505 as of July 1, 2018, a decrease of 451 people from the year prior. Almost every township, village, and city in Belmont County decreased in population, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. That s a huge concern for me. Particularly the river communities, Webster said. There s over 600 billion at stake, and I want to make sure that Belmont County gets our share. He said the committee will be reaching out to schools, health care groups and senior groups. Webster added a significant percentage of Bellaire residents have not been responding to census forms. I m told Bellaire has missed something like 27 percent of the people last time, that did not complete the census, he said. If they did, Bellaire would have probably not been a village, but been a city. He said the committee will also reach out to the more rural areas. In other matters, Jill Hunkler of Barnesville, who has long expressed concern about possible hazards of natural gas and oil fracking, invited the commissioners to a presentation at 5:30 p. m. Jan. 24 at Ohio University Eastern. She said Justin Nobel, science journalist with Rolling Stone Magazine, will speak about radioactivity risks posed by the oil and gas industry. Environmental scientist Julie Weatherington Rice will also be on hand. She also expressed concern about a possible injection well the New Jersey based Omni Energy Group LLC is interested in placing at the intersection of U. S. 40 and Ohio 331. The company has submitted an application with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. In answer to another guest s question, Dutton said he has heard no further updates from ODNR and the commissioners have requested a public meeting before any determination is made. Additionally, the commissioners approved proposal from ERB Electric to install security upgrades at the courthouse for 27,940 and to install a phone and voicemail system for 16,680. Belmont County Engineer Terry Lively also reported slip repair on Blaine Chermont Road in Bridgeport is beginning and the road was being closed so work might be done. That s long awaited. We ve been delayed by utility relocations, Lively said. It s probably going to be three months. It s a long overdue project. It will be closed during construction. More information on the census can be found at the U. S. Census Bureau website, https://www.2020census. gov. Webster can be reached at the church offices at 740 633 2155.

Pompano Citi Centre,"Macy’s Is Closing 30 Stores in Early 2020 The Macy's department store at Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N. J. Update (Jan. 9, 2020) Macy s has confirmed another set of more than a dozen closures, bringing the total number of shutterings to roughly 30 stores. Over the next couple of months, the retailer expects to hold liquidation sales as it downsizes its fleet of brick and mortar outposts. One Bloomingdale s location is also scheduled to shut down. FN has provided a list of the closures below. What We Reported (Jan. 7, 2020): Macy s Is Closing More Than a Dozen Stores in Early 2020 Macy s is set to close more than a dozen stores early this year. The department store chain has confirmed the closures of 15 outposts across the country, including locations in shopping centers as well as free standing locations.

In a statement to FN, a spokesperson said that Macy s regularly review s our store portfolio and will provide an update on the store closures at its investor day on Feb. 5. The announcement comes less than two months after the company posted its third quarter earnings report ended Nov. 2, logging its first same store sales decline in two years and slashing its guidance for the full year. The Cincinnati based firm blamed the disappointing results on the warmer fall season, coupled with slowing foot traffic, amid a broader shift from brick and mortar to online retail. After seven consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth, we experienced a deceleration in our third quarter sales, Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette acknowledged in a statement. While we anticipated a negative comp because we were lapping a very strong third quarter last year, the sales deceleration was steeper than we expected. In the past few months, Macy s has been investing more resources in its e commerce mobile app, which it said is on track to exceed the goal of 1.5 billion in sales, as well as enhancing its website to promote online sales and drive in store visits. Although Gennette said on Nov. 21 that the retailer has confidence in our holiday strategies, Macy s has lowered its outlook, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of 2.57 to 2.77, below the previous guidance of 2.85 to 3.05. It also expects sales to be down 2.5% to 2.0%, versus the previous reading of approximately flat sales.

Macy's to Close 29 Stores as CEO Offers Reassurance Macy s Inc. , under scrutiny as department stores struggle to adapt to changes in the way consumers shop, rose in early trading after Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said the retailer s performance is improving. Macy s also said it will close 28 namesake stores and one Bloomingdale s in the coming weeks, while reducing some headcount at Bloomingdale s. Same store sales, a key metric of retailers success, fell 0.6% in November and December at company owned and licensed stores from a year earlier. Gennette said the holiday sales reflected a strong trend improvement from the third quarter. Macy s stock (M) was higher in early trading. The shares fell 43% last year. The rise suggests investors were already expecting lower comparable sales and were reassured by Gennette s comments. The decline in sales is nowhere near as bad as it could have been and represents a marked improvement from the dismal third quarter when comparable sales declined by 3.9%, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in emailed comments. The company said it will hold a meeting with investors on Feb. 5 in New York, where it will release a three year strategy. Macy s, which had the second worst performing stock in the S P 500 last year, has been closing underperforming stores amid working to reduce superfluous inventory for several years. The earnings news calmed fears of a more dramatic fall in the department store operator's numbers for the crucial annual shopping season after an earlier profit warning, Reuters explained. Macy's, which cut its annual profit forecast in November blaming weak international tourism and sluggish mall traffic, is among the first major corporate names to report sales for the holiday season seen as a barometer for the health of U. S. consumer spending. The company's holiday sales benefited from strong online sales and demand for gift products, Gennette said. U. S. consumers are increasingly spending more money online rather than traveling to physical stores during the holiday season, forcing traditional brick and mortar retailers to build their apps with more shopping and delivery options. U. S. e commerce sales in the period from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 18.8%, according to a Dec. 25 report by Mastercard Inc. , while overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose just 3.4%. The 0.6% reported drop at Macy's owned and licensed stores was for the months of November and December. The months make up the vast majority of fourth quarter comparable sales, which analysts had estimated to fall 1.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Macy's Store Closures May Signal A New Real Estate Strategy (NYSE:M) Following a one year revival that began in late 2017, Macy's (NYSE:M) began to experience sluggish sales trends and plunging profitability again during the 2018 holiday season. Weak trends have persisted throughout fiscal 2019. On the retailer's most recent earnings call, management said that traffic at lower tier malls has declined sharply. Macy's will lay out its three year plan and updated turnaround strategy at an investor meeting in early February. However, the struggling department store giant has already confirmed that it will close at least 29 full line Macy's stores this year. A closer look at Macy's store closure plans points to an aggressive pivot towards driving traffic to high productivity stores (as measured by sales per store or sales per square foot). The retailer is investing in these locations through its ""Growth150"" initiative, while closing nearby stores that don't qualify for investment under this program. If Macy's continues down this road, investors should expect dozens or even hundreds of additional store closures over the next five years. Keeping Growth150 stores and closing the rest Macy's recent moves in New York City's eastern suburbs (Nassau County and western Suffolk County) point to a new store strategy. Today, there are 9 full line Macy's stores in this region. Last year, Macy's upgraded four of them as part of the Growth150 program. Each of these stores is at a high performing mall: (Green Acres Mall, Roosevelt Field, Walt Whitman Shops, and Smith Haven Mall). Last week, Macy's said that it will close two of the other five full line stores in this area during 2020: one in Commack and one in Hicksville. The Commack store is just 7 miles east of Walt Whitman Shops and 10 miles west of Smith Haven Mall. The Hicksville store is 10 miles west of Walt Whitman Shops and 6 miles east of Roosevelt Field. (All three of those high performing malls are owned by mall powerhouse Simon Property Group (SPG). ) (Macy's has stores in all of the best malls on Long Island, like Roosevelt Field. Image source: Simon Property Group. ) Neither of the two stores being closed are in a dying mall. Yet Macy's already has excellent stores nearby where it is investing to improve the customer experience. It makes more sense to drive traffic to those Growth150 stores (where Macy's is putting its best foot forward) rather than keeping the Commack and Hicksville stores open just to provide a minimal level of incremental convenience for customers who live nearby. Similarly, Macy's is closing its store in downtown Seattle, which is ringed by three Growth150 stores all within 11 17 miles. In South Florida, it is closing its Pompano Citi Centre store, which is also surrounded by three Growth150 stores, each of which is 10 11 miles away. Additionally, Macy's is set to close stores in Antioch, California Panthersville, Georgia Cincinnati, Ohio and Goodlettsville, Tennessee that are somewhat further from the nearest Growth150 store, but still no more than 20 miles away. This strategy makes a lot of sense There are many reasons for Macy's to close full line stores that are near Growth150 locations. First, in addition to starting with higher sales productivity, the Growth150 stores are consistently posting stronger comp sales figures than the rest of the store fleet, according to management. In other words, customers are already gravitating towards those stores, so it's logical for Macy's to proactively shutter nearby stores where traffic is falling. Second, as sales productivity continues to decline at non Growth150 locations, it becomes increasingly difficult for those stores to sell their inventory without resorting to big clearance discounts at the end of each season. Thus, cost cuts alone are unlikely to stem the decline in earnings and cash flow from these stores. Low sales productivity also hurts cash flow because it generally implies that inventory turnover is low. Third, because lower performing stores aren't profitable enough to justify major investments by Macy's, the in store shopping environment continues to deteriorate compared to Growth150 stores. Thus, while these locations are individually profitable, they may be hurting the retailer's reputation, which could negatively impact Macy's future earnings. (Low volume Macy's stores, like this one at Exton Square Mall, don't provide a good impression to customers. Image source: Author. ) This is not to say that Macy's will close all of its stores except for the top 150. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette has said that the Growth150 initiative will be expanded to additional stores in the next few years. Up to 350 Macy's stores could potentially receive the extra investment that this program entails (i. e. the current 150 stores plus 200 more). Given the deterioration in its business over the past year, Macy's may not expand its store investment program to quite that many locations. But I expect the majority of the 400 or so full line Macy's stores that are not part of the Growth150 initiative to either receive similar upgrades or be closed over the next 3 5 years. The Baltimore/Washington D. C. area: a case study To illustrate how Macy's may shrink its store portfolio in the years ahead, let's look at the greater Washington, D. C. /Baltimore market as an example. Today, Macy's operates about two dozen full line stores in the region (depending on exactly how you define the boundaries). None of these were included in last week's store closure announcements. Of these 24 locations, 6 have already been upgraded as part of the Growth150 program. One is the Metro Center store in Washington, D. C. two are in malls in Arlington and Springfield, Virginia and three are in malls in Annapolis, Columbia, and Towson, Maryland. Several other stores are very likely to be renovated in the near future and kept for the long term. Tysons Corner Center, Fair Oaks Mall, Westfield Montgomery, and Mall at Prince George's are all strong malls serving distinct submarkets in the Washington, D. C. suburbs, and the Macy's stores at those properties should be very successful. Others are likely to be closed in the near future. Macy's is the last remaining anchor at Lakeforest Mall in Gaithersburg, Maryland after three other department stores bailed out last year. The mall was sold recently and the new owner plans to redevelop it. Macy's is likely to close and sell its store there, especially given that its much stronger store at Westfield Montgomery is less than 12 miles away. The Macy's stores at struggling Security Square Mall in Baltimore and Marley Station Mall in Glen Burnie, Maryland are probably on life support, too, with multiple Growth150 stores nearby. (Growth150 stores look far more attractive than unrenovated Macy's stores. Image source: Author. ) Macy's stores at Manassas Mall in Manassas, Virginia and Harford Mall in Bel Air, Maryland are also at risk. Both malls have sales per square foot of less than 375, and there are other Macy's stores at stronger malls within a reasonable distance. The store at Francis Scott Key Mall in Frederick, Maryland may survive a little longer because it is further from other Macy's stores, but in the long run, weak traffic at that mall will probably doom it, too. That leaves eight other stores in the Baltimore/D. C. area that have some points in their favor but could also find themselves on the chopping block either due to the value of the underlying land or because of future underperformance. Thus, Macy's store count in the region is likely to shrink by at least 25% over the next five years or so. It could potentially decrease by 50% 60% if the chain really cut back to just its most successful locations. There's a lot of work to do Macy's has made significant progress in rationalizing its store base over the past five years, including the 2020 store closures that have already been announced. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of room for improvement on this score. Today, there are many low productivity Macy's stores that are within 15 20 miles (and often even within less than 10 miles) of high performing Growth150 stores. For the most part, if these stores aren't doing well enough to justify investing in them, they should be closed. The cost of continuing to operate these locations (in terms of potential brand damage, greater need for markdowns, and low inventory turnover) is too high in today's retail environment. Stores that are further away from other Macy's locations face a lower bar to stay open. But being the only Macy's within 40 or 50 miles no longer guarantees that a store is safe if sales productivity is low and heading even lower. On the other hand, there are also plenty of Macy's stores that weren't included in the Growth150 program but are well located and merit similar investments. Macy's should try to complete all of these remaining renovations within the next two years. Despite its poor results recently, Macy's has what it takes to remain a major player in the retail landscape five years from now while maintaining reasonable margins. However, cost cuts alone (as outlined by the company last September) won't get it to where it needs to be. Macy's must adopt a strategy of keeping its best stores and closing most of the rest. Fortunately, the retailer's recent store closure announcements suggest that it is already moving in that direction.

Roscoe Road,"News, Sports, Jobs - The Times Leader ST. CLAIRSVILLE Gov. Mike DeWine continues to ask Ohio nursing home workers to get vaccinated against COVID 19. We ve made nursing homes a priority because over half our deaths in the state of Ohio have occurred in nursing homes. Our goal is to get as many people in nursing homes residents as well as those who work in nursing homes the opportunity to take the shot as quickly as they can, DeWine said. He said 61 percent of Ohio nursing homes have been visited by those who are administering vaccinations. Several staffers were vaccinated during the governor s broadcast on Tuesday. DeWine said about 40 percent of nursing home staff members have opted to take the first shot. He said about 75 percent to 80 percent of residents of those homes have been vaccinated. On Friday, some nursing homes will be visited a second time for a follow up dose. Ursel McElroy, director of the Ohio Department of Aging, said nursing home employees have been hesitant for a variety of reasons, including fear of side effects and concerns about the shots safety and effectiveness due to the newness of the vaccine. We are reasonably concerned that given any refusal or delay of vaccination reduces our goal of widespread compliance, and it compromises our ability to eradicate this virus. We re hoping to see those numbers climb, McElroy said, adding that her office is reaching out with expert testimony. DeWine said statewide, there were close to 1 million people in the 1A vaccination group, which included home health workers, hospice workers, emergency medical service responders, primary care practitioners, free standing emergency department employees, urgent care site workers, pharmacy workers, dialysis and dental providers, and mobile unit practitioners. Belmont County Deputy Health Commissioner Robert Sproul announced that his office is beginning Phase 1B of the vaccination effort. People eligible in Phase 1B include Ohioans age 65 and older, those living with severe congenital, developmental or early onset medical disorders, and adults who work in school systems. Those people can call the Health Department for an appointment at 740 695 1202, ext. 120. Recipients of the initial shot must receive a second dose in about 28 days. DeWine said statewide, there are well over 1 million people in the 1B category. The governor has said he hopes Ohio s students can resume in person schooling in March. There are about 300,000 kindergarten through 12th grade staff eligible for the vaccine. Belmont County Senior Services Director Dwayne Pielech said his department is not administering the vaccines, but there is considerable enthusiasm among area senior citizens who want to receive the shot. We ve been getting calls at the agency seniors calling, confused, Pielech said. I think there s some impression out there that we have something to do with coordinating the vaccines, which we don t. We re not a medical provider. We don t do anything like that. Sproul said Phase 1B vaccines will be administered by appointment only next week at the Wise Building at the Belmont County Fairgrounds, located along Roscoe Road west of St. Clairsville. Personally, I would encourage a senior to get the vaccination, especially if they have health risk, but really it ends up being a personal decision between them and their family members and their family doctor, Pielech said. As an agency director, we re still in anticipation of our front line workers (getting vaccinated). We ve got workers questioning, When are we going to be able to get the vaccination? We haven t heard anything yet. We like to believe we re part of the front line workers. We re serving 11,00 meals a day, he said, adding his staff also includes drivers who transport seniors to medical appointments. Sproul reports that Belmont County has confirmed 3,937 cases of COVID 19 among its residents since the pandemic s onset. He said 968 people are isolated at home with active cases Tuesday compared to 1,024 on Monday, and 2,857 recoveries Tuesday compared to 2,738 at the beginning of the week. Sproul said 37 people are hospitalized with the virus, and he reported that deaths associated with the virus increased from 73 to 75, with the latest victims being men in their 70s and 60s.

Pickering Road,"Officials comment on injection wells ST. CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County officials were disppointed and dismayed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources approval of a permit for New Jersey based Omni Energy Co. to place two saltwater injection wells at the intersection of U. S. 40 and Ohio 331. The Ohio Supreme Court had ordered ODNR to make a decision regarding the permit. This occurred after a lawsuit filed by Robert E. Bob Murray, who has since died, had delayed the process since April. Murray s filing argued that there should be a public hearing on the matter to allow nearby residents to voice their concerns. The coronavirus pandemic had prevented such a gathering, the High Court ruled that such a meeting was not required. The Richland Township trustees previously tabled a request from Omni Energy to allow ingress from U. S. 40 onto Pickering Road, but Ohio Department of Transportation spokeswoman Lauren Borell confirmed that ODOT has granted Omni Energy a permit to make an access road for the site. Our only role in this was to review and consider their application for construction of an access drive to the injection well site, and to connect them to U. S. 40, she said. All the necessary information on the drive application was previously provided to us and reviewed. Once Omni provided those copies of ODNR permits that were recently approved, District 11 did issue a right of way permit for construction. This permit was handled as we would throughout the state. We issue probably thousands of permits each year. The Belmont County Board of Commissioners had also opposed the presence of wells at that site. I m disappointed that they came out with that decision, Commissioner Jerry Echemann said, adding the commissioners had relayed their concerns to ODNR and the opinion that the site was not suitable for wells. Unfortunately, they don t have to go by anything that we say. They can issue that permit as they like, and they did it without notifying us. We would have appreciated giving us a heads up a few days before, but we found out the same time as the rest of the general public, Echemann said. There s not much we can do. That s the way the law reads, but if ODNR feels it s geologically possible to have an injection well at that site, they can give approval, which is what they did. I understand the need to have business, but I wish they d have found a better location. I m not thrilled about where they re going to put that, St. Clairsville Mayor Kathryn Thalman said. It s out of the city limits. There s nothing we can do about it. Thalman expressed concerns about road damage due to increased traffic, as well as the possibility of accidents. Omni officials have said all precautions will be taken and the company intends to proceed quickly. The company could be ready to apply for a permit to operate the wells by late spring or early summer.

Mount Olivett Road,"Loan renewed for Belmont slip repairs ST. CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County s board of commissioners heard an update on road slip repair Wednesday. Commissioners Josh Meyer, J. P. Dutton and Jerry Echemann renewed a 4 million loan to pay part of the cost of repairing, constructing and reconstructing roads in the county. The commissioners also approved Dinsmore Shohl LLP to act as bond counsel. A federal disaster was declared for the local area last February. According to the county engineer s office, Belmont County sustained close to 12 million worth of road damage. Engineer Terry Lively explained that the county must complete the work before being reimbursed with federal funds through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We borrowed that (money) to give us a head start on the slip repairs. The way the FEMA money works, once it finally gets authorized, we have to go out and make the repair, and they reimburse us for that. We weren t sure of the pace in which those projects would get approved. My concern was we were going to have a bunch of projects sitting here, ready to go, and not have the money to do the work up front. So I asked the commissioners to get a loan, using license plate fees as the payment, so we could get those projects rolling as quickly as possible, as soon as they get through the process and get approved by FEMA or Federal Highways. Lively said the money was borrowed for a period of one year and the loan had to be renewed. They pay back the whole 4 million, and then re borrow it, he said. There s interest to pay on that, but in my opinion it s well worth it to pay that interest, so that we have the flexibility to get on these slips as quickly as possible and get them repaired, he said. Lively said additional license plate fees approved by the commissioners several years ago generate about 800,000 annually. Using that money to pay the interest, pay the loan off, he said, adding the license plate funds will be used for street paving and guardrail repairs after the emergency damage is repaired. Once we get the slips done. He said the interest was about three percent. The annual interest payment is almost 120,000. In answer to the commissioners questions, Lively said the process remains a slow one. We re not getting things approved as quickly as we had hoped. We are getting things done, little by little, he said. He said four FEMA projects have been completed and two more have been approved, and one completed for Federal Highways. Lively said he hopes multiple Federal Highways projects will be approved at once. I think this is going to be a busy year as far as construction. We ll see a lot of things happening, at least on the Federal Highways side. On the FEMA side, we re still working our way through that red tape, he said. He said slips have been repaired on Belmont County Road 5, or Ramsey Ridge Road, near Alledonia Pleasant Ridge, south of Belmont and two on Fulton Hill in Pultney Township. We still have Road Closed signs up, because we have three other slips on Fulton Road. We re allowing local traffic through it, but we don t want big vehicles going through there, he said. He said slip repair for Blaine Chermont Road in Bridgeport has been bid out and utilities were were being relocated. Lively hopes the project will be done soon. It s completely out of our hands. We have to wait on the utility companies to move, he said. Mount Olivett Road in Barnesville is also close to approval. He said a slip on Crabapple Road in the St. Clairsville area has also been repaired. He said the projects that have been repairs are so far all from the 2018 disaster. The 2019 stuff is not even close to being ready yet, he said. Out of the 2018 disaster, we probably have 45 slips. Out of the 2019, we probably added another 20 to 25. Some of them have been rejected by FEMA so we re going to have to fix them as best we can. Lively said in a normal year, his office would deal with as many as five slips. We re used to that, but when we get hit with 40 to 50 of them in a year, it s overwhelming, he said. Afterward, he said he also applied for a grant through the new Oil and Shale Program through the Ohio Department of Transportation. It s designed to help the counties in this part of the state that are impacted by oil and gas activity. Most of those roads are covered by (road use maintenance) agreements, and this is specifically designed to help out roads that don t have a RUMA agreement on it, even though they re getting traffic, and they re getting damage, Lively said. I submitted an application back in October, we got a project approved down on Blaine Barton Road. It s a slip down there, and we got about 145,000 to repair that slip. He said the slip dates from prior to 2018 and was exacerbated by more recent wet weather. Work should begin 2021. Afterward, John Drewett of Lashley Hill Road, Shadyside, said his road continues to be closed due to two year old slips. In 2018, there was supposed to be money allotted for slips then, and we re behind. It s 2020 now, he said. Where (are we) on the list? There s no light at the end of the tunnel. I don t even see a tunnel. They re not catching up to 2018, how are we going to get things taken care of? This process has drug on, Dutton said. The incident in 2018 was very significant, followed by an incident in 2019, which affected these sites from 2018, which grew in scope and had to be re evaluated. We re as frustrated as everyone else. The engineer just can t go out and start doing these projects. He ll be bankrupt by the end of the week, Meyer said.

Rehm Road,"Be Local By Experiencing Convenience and Friendly Service at Porterfield’s Drive-Thru Porterfield s Drive Thru Farm Garden on Rehm Road off U. S. 40 just east of St. Clairsville has earned recognition and loyal customers from near and far since owner Kirke Porterfield started the business in 1991. Porterfield said he draws on deep roots and a farming tradition in serving the area s agricultural needs. We ve farmed forever. My family started farming in Belmont County in 1809, so I continued. Then we started selling fertilizer, seed corn, and different things. Then we had an opportunity with this property here in town and we started with birdseed, grass seed, straw and dog food, he said. The business expanded over the years as Porterfield remained on the lookout for more items and services. When something s your passion and you start a business for it, you re hungry for that. That s what you like to do, he said. Along with a variety of products, the convenience and speedy service also sets the store apart. The drive through makes it nice. You don t have to get out of your car. You can drive through and say I need a bag of birdseed or a bag of grass seed or whatever, and you re on your way. Or you can park in front and come in and talk about what you re working on. In terms of variety, he said customers range from large farmers, part time farmers or simply locals who live in town and enjoy feeding birds. Porterfield pointed out bales of straw and hay, barbed wire, pro mix, and diesel fuel heaters as some of the items local residents purchase. We have a nice customer base, he said. For the bad weather, we sell a lot of salt and also skids to the fellows that plow snow for different businesses. They stop and we know them. We know their name and we know their truck and we see them pulling in and we re on the forklift. In the big box stores it takes a long time to get loaded and on to the next job. Porterfield said the quality of customer service at the local level is a guiding principle at his business. We try to take care of people as soon as they come in. If we don t have what they need, we have resources to get a lot of different types of feed, he said. We unload stuff for people, he said. It can t be delivered to their home: they ll use our address and we ll unload it and they ll come over and pick it up. The feed store has three employees. Katrina Reynolds, a six year employee, has gotten to know Porterfield and the regulars. Kirke is a good guy. He would do anything for anybody, she said. I love my job. I love the customers. Our customers are great to me. I ve gotten Christmas gifts from our regular customers. The customers are wonderful. That s what keeps me coming back every day. Reynolds said the store does considerable repeat business. Ninety percent of them are my regulars, she said. There s a lot of them, but I know what they want, so I m already waiting by the skid when they pull in. Community involvement is another priority for Porterfield. Most recently through his membership in the St. Clairsville Rotary Club, he has helped arrange for banners honoring veterans to be hung on city poles. He also serves on community boards. Along with local buyers, Porterfield also supplies material to oil and gas interests. In addition, Porterfield is introducing the local area to a southern staple in coffee, carrying Community Coffee out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He added this is a favorite among oil and gas workers who come from the south. Along with the store, Porterfield works to keep his family s agricultural tradition alive. One of his sons maintains Porterfield s Fabrication Services on the farm northwest of St. Clairsville and manufactures items for local farmers and the oil and gas businesses. Another son operates the farm and 400 beef cows. We sell meat from our own cows here at the feed store, he said. It s all hamburger. It s all natural. No drugs or hormones you can tell the difference. Porterfield is also known for Kirke s Homemade Ice Cream, located above the feed store and active since 1992. Ice cream s a great business. It s enjoyable, he said. It s our own recipe. The drive through is open 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. The store is closed Sundays. For more information, call 740 695 6234. The drive through and ice cream stores are part of the Be Local network of local businesses. Be Local is the region s premier shop local promotion and education network.

Lashley Hill Road,"Loan renewed for Belmont slip repairs ST. CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County s board of commissioners heard an update on road slip repair Wednesday. Commissioners Josh Meyer, J. P. Dutton and Jerry Echemann renewed a 4 million loan to pay part of the cost of repairing, constructing and reconstructing roads in the county. The commissioners also approved Dinsmore Shohl LLP to act as bond counsel. A federal disaster was declared for the local area last February. According to the county engineer s office, Belmont County sustained close to 12 million worth of road damage. Engineer Terry Lively explained that the county must complete the work before being reimbursed with federal funds through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We borrowed that (money) to give us a head start on the slip repairs. The way the FEMA money works, once it finally gets authorized, we have to go out and make the repair, and they reimburse us for that. We weren t sure of the pace in which those projects would get approved. My concern was we were going to have a bunch of projects sitting here, ready to go, and not have the money to do the work up front. So I asked the commissioners to get a loan, using license plate fees as the payment, so we could get those projects rolling as quickly as possible, as soon as they get through the process and get approved by FEMA or Federal Highways. Lively said the money was borrowed for a period of one year and the loan had to be renewed. They pay back the whole 4 million, and then re borrow it, he said. There s interest to pay on that, but in my opinion it s well worth it to pay that interest, so that we have the flexibility to get on these slips as quickly as possible and get them repaired, he said. Lively said additional license plate fees approved by the commissioners several years ago generate about 800,000 annually. Using that money to pay the interest, pay the loan off, he said, adding the license plate funds will be used for street paving and guardrail repairs after the emergency damage is repaired. Once we get the slips done. He said the interest was about three percent. The annual interest payment is almost 120,000. In answer to the commissioners questions, Lively said the process remains a slow one. We re not getting things approved as quickly as we had hoped. We are getting things done, little by little, he said. He said four FEMA projects have been completed and two more have been approved, and one completed for Federal Highways. Lively said he hopes multiple Federal Highways projects will be approved at once. I think this is going to be a busy year as far as construction. We ll see a lot of things happening, at least on the Federal Highways side. On the FEMA side, we re still working our way through that red tape, he said. He said slips have been repaired on Belmont County Road 5, or Ramsey Ridge Road, near Alledonia Pleasant Ridge, south of Belmont and two on Fulton Hill in Pultney Township. We still have Road Closed signs up, because we have three other slips on Fulton Road. We re allowing local traffic through it, but we don t want big vehicles going through there, he said. He said slip repair for Blaine Chermont Road in Bridgeport has been bid out and utilities were were being relocated. Lively hopes the project will be done soon. It s completely out of our hands. We have to wait on the utility companies to move, he said. Mount Olivett Road in Barnesville is also close to approval. He said a slip on Crabapple Road in the St. Clairsville area has also been repaired. He said the projects that have been repairs are so far all from the 2018 disaster. The 2019 stuff is not even close to being ready yet, he said. Out of the 2018 disaster, we probably have 45 slips. Out of the 2019, we probably added another 20 to 25. Some of them have been rejected by FEMA so we re going to have to fix them as best we can. Lively said in a normal year, his office would deal with as many as five slips. We re used to that, but when we get hit with 40 to 50 of them in a year, it s overwhelming, he said. Afterward, he said he also applied for a grant through the new Oil and Shale Program through the Ohio Department of Transportation. It s designed to help the counties in this part of the state that are impacted by oil and gas activity. Most of those roads are covered by (road use maintenance) agreements, and this is specifically designed to help out roads that don t have a RUMA agreement on it, even though they re getting traffic, and they re getting damage, Lively said. I submitted an application back in October, we got a project approved down on Blaine Barton Road. It s a slip down there, and we got about 145,000 to repair that slip. He said the slip dates from prior to 2018 and was exacerbated by more recent wet weather. Work should begin 2021. Afterward, John Drewett of Lashley Hill Road, Shadyside, said his road continues to be closed due to two year old slips. In 2018, there was supposed to be money allotted for slips then, and we re behind. It s 2020 now, he said. Where (are we) on the list? There s no light at the end of the tunnel. I don t even see a tunnel. They re not catching up to 2018, how are we going to get things taken care of? This process has drug on, Dutton said. The incident in 2018 was very significant, followed by an incident in 2019, which affected these sites from 2018, which grew in scope and had to be re evaluated. We re as frustrated as everyone else. The engineer just can t go out and start doing these projects. He ll be bankrupt by the end of the week, Meyer said.

Clyde Morris Boulevard,"Homeless safe zone outside new shelter in limbo Eileen Zaffiro Kean eileen. zaffiro kean news jrnl. com DAYTONA BEACH After many debates about whether there should be an outdoor safe zone for homeless people in front of the new First Step Shelter, plans for a temporary holding area are still up in the air. In an email sent Friday to First Step Shelter Board members, First Step Executive Director Victoria Fahlberg wrote that the (city) manager has decided to not move forward with building it. Fahlberg said Monday she doesn t know the details behind the decision, which she learned about in an email last week from a city employee. We ve been waiting for them for a plan, she said. He said for now it s on hold. The city manager s decision is likely to spark more discussion Wednesday when the six member board that oversees the shelter on the city s western edge meets for the first time since the refuge for homeless adults opened Dec. 16. A major reason some local governments contributed their money to First Step Shelter is to have access to a safe zone where homeless people can stay when they don t want to have anything to do with the programs and rules inside or all the beds are occupied. Daytona Beach has had an outdoor safe zone on Clyde Morris Boulevard near Beville Road for a few years, but it s only available for homeless people inside Daytona city limits. If there s no safe zone, Port Orange will be gone the next day, said First Step Shelter Board member Chase Tramont, also a Port Orange City Council member. There won t be another dime from Port Orange. Mayor Derrick Henry, who s president of the First Step Shelter Board, doesn t see the safe zone idea as dead now. Top city staff just seem to have solidified their decision not to pay for a safe zone, but that doesn t mean the shelter board can t come up with something it can afford, Henry said. I doubt I ll ask the City Commission to pay for it, Henry said Monday. I think the city has pretty much done its part financially. City commissioners would need to approve safe zone plans, but the mayor said he doesn t see that being a problem. He doesn t believe City Manager Jim Chisholm would be opposed either to the right plan. As a board, we ll just have to find our way how to do it, Henry said. There s probably a cheaper way to do it. If a police officer wants to arrest a homeless person who s engaged in a life sustaining activity such as sleeping or urinating somewhere they shouldn t, the officer needs to offer them the option of a shelter or safe zone. And under a legal precedent set by a landmark court case, a shelter isn t an option if it has the requirements First Step Shelter has. Even the safe zone has to have very low rule barriers for entry to be legally compliant. Up until last year, the vision for the shelter was a ""come as you are"" facility that would welcome most any person. But the closer it got to opening day, the more rules and limits were added to those who wanted to use First Step to get their lives back on track. The shelter, which is being run by Catholic Charities of Central Florida, is only accepting people who agree to criminal background checks, follow a long list of shelter rules and are committed to working with a case manager to get off the streets. The shelter has capacity for more than 100 residents, but mainly because of budget constraints is starting out with 40 beds. There are currently 20 shelter residents, 11 women and nine men, Fahlberg said Monday. That headcount is in line with the plan to slowly add residents. At their meeting Wednesday, shelter board members will discuss whether to open First Step Shelter to homeless people looking to get out of the cold for a night or two. Local architect John Hall, who designed the 15,820 square foot city owned shelter, estimates it would cost about 200,000 to build a fenced in safe zone along with a temperature controlled guard shack with WiFi. Adding some sort of security screening machine in front of the shelter, cameras, new landscaping to block the public s view of the safe zone and a cement pad to keep people from having to sit in soggy grass on rainy days have all been discussed as things needed for the holding area where people could stay for several hours if they chose. But the cost of adding all those things, along with an additional 150,000 per year to have a security guard watching the safe zone 24 hours a day, is too exorbitant for Tramont. Shelter funds have dwindled from more than 900,000 in September to about 341,000 now. But that figure could rapidly rise if the city of Daytona Beach sends the 400,000 set aside in its current budget for the shelter and the county government starts sending the funds it promised to match city expenditures up to 400,000 per year for five years. Spending 350,000 for a safe zone in the first year and at least 150,000 every year after is a needless waste of the shelter s limited dollars, Tramont said. From City Manager Jim Chisholm s perspective, I understand his point of view, Tramont said. I wouldn't expect Daytona to foot the bill. I think it's an outrageous cost. "" Chisholm did not return calls Monday seeking comment, and city spokeswoman Susan Cerbone did not respond to emailed questions about the safe zone. Tramont has never wanted the safe zone to be in front of the building, and he thinks a much simpler holding area would suffice. He suggests putting a fence around the patch of grass behind the shelter building and calling that the safe zone. ""I think it's way overboard to do a cement slab and overhead protection,"" Tramont said. ""I think it'll be marginally used at best. There will be no access to food or services. I can't imagine people opting to stay. "" If a safe zone is created, people would be free to leave at any time but could stay for well over 12 hours. People who enter the safe zone from 12:30 p. m. until midnight would have to leave by 8 a. m. the next day. Those who enter after midnight would have to leave by noon. Tramont thinks safe zone security could be handled with an employee or guard walking around the 10 acre property and monitoring the fenced in with a security camera. Tramont said it's absolutely essential that a safe zone is included somewhere on the shelter property. ""This has to happen. You've got to do it,"" he said. ""You've got to have the zone for the cities that were promised it.

""In other words, stepping out in front of a vehicle, not using a crosswalk, crossing at a place where traffic is not expecting it, a sudden dart into traffic or a bicyclist that crosses the road in front of traffic, those seem to be the primary causes of most of the traffic fatalities. "" Fulcher said HVE doesn't target drivers as much as pedestrians and riders because in most fatalities the driver didn't see the pedestrian until it was too late. ""A lot of it is just an unexpected entry into the roadway in front of a vehicle where the driver just doesn't have time to react,"" Fulcher said. Fulcher said 10 people were killed by cars in 2017 and six in 2018 in Daytona Beach. Daytona Beach was ranked as the 4th most dangerous mid sized city in Florida for pedestrian and bicycle rider deaths. FDOT analyzed our statistics and realized we do have a high number of pedestrian involved crashes in our city, Fulcher said. Ad Police applied for a grant from the Florida Department of Transportation to improve that ranking and FDOT agreed to pay for the overtime for as many as a dozen officers to conduct HVE. Fulcher and the other officers focus on heavily traveled streets, many of them six lane roadways, surrounding shopping centers, beaches, and offices on Nova Road, Mason Avenue, Clyde Morris Boulevard, Ridgewood Avenue, International Speedway Boulevard and A1A. Fulcher looks for walkers and riders who aren't using crosswalks, crossing during green lights, or any other behavior that puts a person in danger. For the most part, he doesn't hand out tickets, just potentially life saving advice. ""Mostly what we see in our city is often times the pedestrian isn't thinking before they enter the roadway,"" Fulcher said. Fulcher also hands out blinking red LED bicycle lights. He said he's seeing more and more of them in use on bikes all over the city. Ad My perception is that it s working, Fulcher said. I see less violations and at night I see more bikes with lights which is great.

Hatoba,"28 Must-Try DC Restaurant Dishes Now Available for Pickup and Delivery Original May 2020 post updated There was a time you d have to wait in line or make a hard won reservation to get a taste of sensational restaurant dishes like the Red Hen s sausage rigatoni, the duck at Peking Gourmet Inn, or Kinship s roast chicken. Times have obviously changed, and one small silver lining: now you can get these classics old and new delivered to your door or for pickup. 2 Amys deviled eggs with green sauce 3715 Macomb St. , NW Sure, 2 Amys is one of DC s most popular pizzerias for a reason (the Neapolitan pizzas). But! We ve always loved the sophisticated, unfussy small plates heavy on anchovies, cured meats, and seasonal gems as much as the Neapolitan pies. These jammy eggs with herbaceous salsa verde always steal the show. Order online for pickup. A J dim sum 1319 Rockville Pike, Rockville 4316 Markham St. , Annandale We ve spent many a weekend waiting for a coveted table outside these tiny, family run Chinese spots (also: seeking out an ATM for the cash only rule). These days you can get everything to go we love the scallion pancakes, juicy dumplings, beef wraps, spicy noodle soups, and cucumber salad and pay through Venmo. Call or order online. Bad Saint 3226 11th St. , NW Who would have thought this tiny, ultra popular Filipino restaurant would package their line standing dishes to go? The takeout menu (served Thursday through Saturday) changes so often it s hard to pinpoint one item, but the punchy, creative flavors we ve come to expect are all there. Past dishes include crab fat noodles, spring rolls, and pork belly. There s also an online marketplace with homemade chili sauces, noodles, CSA boxes, and more. Order online. Beteseb vegetable platter and rib eye tibs 8201 Georgia Ave. , Silver Spring Ethiopian food travels beautifully, and out of all the options, we re partial to this family run restaurant in Silver Spring. Go for rib eye tibs saut ed with onion and green pepper and the heaping vegetarian platter. For the brave: the kitfo (tartare like minced raw beef) is superb. Call for pickup. Cane tiffin boxes 403 H St. , NE We loved crowding around the tables at chef Peter Prime s small H Street dining room pre Covid. The menu hasn t changed much for takeout a good thing and the tiffin boxes are a great way to go for both sampling and travel (curries generally carry well). Pick between omnivore or vegetarian, both loaded with curries, chutneys, and homemade bread. Order online for pickup. Columbia Room cocktails 124 Blagden Alley, NW Derek Brown s classy cocktail destination has been packaging seasonal drinks to go since the stat of the pandemic (and unlike some of the straightforward cocktails on the takeout market, good luck creating these at home). For January, Brown also has non alcoholic creations. If you re hungry, check out Your Only Friend sandwich pop up. Order online for pickup and delivery. Compass Rose khachupuri 1346 T St. , NW Rose Previte s 14th Street dining room certainly didn t invent the decadent Georgian cheese bread, but it can claim responsibility for popularizing it to Jumbo Slice level proportions in the minds of hungry Washingtonians. Instead of a server mixing molten cheese, egg, and butter inside the canoe shaped bread table side, the takeout version comes with instructions for doing it at home. Order online for takeout. The Dabney catfish sliders 122 Blagden Alley NW You ll have to order a three course menu ( 45) to get chef Jeremiah Langhorne s previously off menu crispy catfish sandwich but the addictive bite is worth it. Other seasonal dishes like barbecue chicken don t sound shabby, either. Order online for takeout and delivery. Daikaya ramen 705 Sixth St. , NW Daikaya s siblings all jumped onto the takeout wagon pre pandemic, including chicken centric Bantam King and Navy Yard s Hatoba. But these days you can get the original Daikaya ramen to go, plus tons of fun extras from their online marketplace. Our move: the muggi miso ramen or the vegetarian version with an optional porky spice bomb. Order online for pickup and delivery. Fiola Mare lobster ravioli 3100 K St. , NW It s always a special (re: very expensive) splurge to dine at Fabio Trabbochi s Georgetown restaurant. Takeout and delivery are no different. Does 60 ravioli to go seem insanely indulgent? Yes. But these ravioli come stuffed with lobster, half a tail, and a velvety lobster sauce. And they cost a fraction of that vacation you re not taking. Order online for pickup and delivery. Hank s Oyster Bar lobster roll Locations in Dupont Circle, the Wharf, Capitol Hill Over a decade later, our favorite item on chef Jamie Leeds menu is the lobster roll packed with sweet meat is on the menu of classics. For a side, go for the ultra creamy mac n cheese or lobster bisque. Available for pickup or delivery. Jaleo gambas al ajillo Locations in Penn Quarter, Bethesda, and Crystal City This simple yet delicious dish of garlicky shrimp debuted with Jose Andres first Jaleo in Penn Quarter 27 years ago and there s a reason its been on the menu of every Jaleo since. Classic sangria or an excellent gin and tonic are on the menu too. Order online for pickup and delivery. Kinship roast chicken 1015 Seventh St. , NW Chef Eric Ziebold s fancy roast chicken strutted onto the scene when the luxe poultry trend was just beginning and it s still one of the best. The roast bird, which serves two to four ( 45), comes with pommes rissol es, lemon garlic panade, and salad. For dessert, splurge on gooey butter cookies. Order online for pickup. Komi pita bread 1509 17th St. , NW Chef Johnny Monis closed his fine dining destination at the start of the pandemic and reopened as Happy Gyro, a veggie centric ode his family s Greek diner. The menu of pizzas and sandwiches looks a lot different, but the homemade, ethereal pita breads that accompanied every Komi feast can be ordered as gyro sandwiches (we love the vegetarian and lamb) or solo to start the meal (go ahead and splurge on the barrel aged feta with it). Another thing we re psyched to see on the go: sommelier Kyle Wilson s carefully curated wines, beers, and ciders. Order online for pickup. Maketto fried chicken 1351 H St. , NE Chef Erik Bruner Yang isn t a newcomer to the takeout platform and that s a good thing for consistency s sake. His mouth tingling, generous plate of fried chicken, spiced with Szechuan peppercorns and drizzled in five spice caramel, is as good as ever. Available for pickup or delivery. Le Diplomate cheeseburger Am ricain 1601 14th St. , NW Le Dip s burger is basically a cheffy riff on le Big Mac: two diner style, dry aged patties, creamy special sauce, pickles, and onions on a homemade brioche bun. It ll cost you 20 these days (with ultra crispy fries) but it s a meal in itself. Unless, like us, you re tempted by the brasserie s sleeper hit: the buttery shrimp salad. Available for takeout or delivery on multiple platforms. Little Serow whiskey pork ribs 1511 17th St. , NW In the old days, you d have to wait in line and then sweat through a fiery, multi course meal to reach Serow s pork y pinnacle: charred, whiskey marinated ribs. Now you can get them a la carte (plus rice and veggies) as part of the takeout menu, or as part of a multi course set dinner to g0. Order online for takeout. Market Lunch crabcake breakfast 225 Seventh St. , SE There s something ultra satisfying about indulging in crabcakes for breakfast. This 40 plus year old Eastern Market dining counter griddles the meaty cakes alongside creamy grits and scrambled eggs. You can get them at lunch, or packaged and ready to make at home. These days, the operation takes credit cards. Call for curbside pickup. Oohhs Aahhs shrimp n grits 1005 U St. , NW 5933 Georgia Ave. , NW If you re seeking comfort to go, it s hard to go wrong at the soul food restaurant fried chicken or fish, mac n cheese, turkey wings we could go on. But it s hard to beat a bowl of the shrimp and creamy homemade grits, which never skimps on the seafood. Ten shrimp can come grilled, fried, or best yet, blackened with Cajun spice. Order online for pickup. Padaek/Thip Khao crispy coconut rice salad 6395 Seven Corners Center, Falls Church 3462 14th St. , NW Chef Seng Luangrath and Bobby Pradacith s Lao restaurants in DC and Falls Church are both open for takeout. It s hard to miss on either menu, but the crunchy rice salad strewn with herbs, morsels of sausage and peanuts, and lettuce leaves for wrapping is a must (it can also be made veggie). Available for carryout from Padaek order online for Thip Khao. Peking Gourmet Inn Peking duck 6029 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church The Peking duck at Eddie Tsui s Falls Church mainstay became so popular in the 80s that the family opened their own farm in Purcelville, Virginia to grow thousands of pounds of spring onions to accompany the crackling skinned bird and homemade pancakes. You can get a whole duck ( 50) to go, and don t forget an order of shrimp with garlic shoots. Available for takeout and free delivery within a limited radius. Pho 75 1 pho 1721 Wilson Blvd, Arlington 771 Hungerford Dr, Rockville These soup parlors were ladeling no frills, soul warming bowls of Vietnamese pho long before the dish became trendy. You won t find large, varied menus just the soup, with extras like Vietnamese ice coffee. We re fans of the 1, floating with eye round steak, flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe plus heaps of herbs. Call for pickup cash only. The Prime Rib prime rib 2020 K St. , NW With a dress code policy and tagline like the civilized steakhouse, we were surprised to see this K Street stalwart offer takeout. But sure enough, you can get a juicy, 24 ounce hunk of prime meat on the fly, rounded out with lobster bisque or a wedge salad. Whether you don the proper jacket at home is up to you. Order here for pickup and delivery. Rappahannock Oyster Bar oysters on the half shell 1150 Maine Ave. , SW We ve spent many a happy afternoon over a chilled platter of briny Olde Salt and creamy Rochambeau oysters (meaty clams, too). The good news: that doesn t have to change thanks to the Wharf location s to go offerings, which even include chilled wines. Bivalves can be ordered shucked and ready, or whole to pop open at home. We re also fans of the crabcake, chowder, and peel and eat shrimp. Order online for pickup. Rasika palaak chaat 633 D St. , NW 1190 New Hampshire Ave. , NW Indian food is one of those cuisines that travels reliably well, and while chef Vikram Sunderam s crispy spinach may not hold up as well as a curry, we ve found it still fares well (credit the cooling yogurt, dates, and chutney each packaged separately). You can also buy homemade Rasika simmer sauces for cooking at home. Available for pickup or delivery. Red Hen rigatoni with sausage ragu 1822 First St. , NW This comforting bowl of pasta with a saucy Sunday style gravy packed with homemade fennel sausage and capped with parm has been on chef Michael Friedman s menu since day one. There s a reason it s never left. Order online for pickup or delivery. Rose s Luxury Pork and lychee salad 717 Eighth St. , SE Chef Aaron Silverman s unexpectedly addictive salad of sweet lychees, chilies, onion, pork, and coconut milk is a dish that helped land Rose s Luxury on the national map. You can now get it along with buzzed about entrees like grilled pork ribs as part of a three course takeout spread ( 45 per person). Order online for pickup. Sushi Taro chirashi 1503 17th St. , NW The Michelin starred Dupont restaurant never offered much takeout over its decades in business until the pandemic. Now it s all in, offering everything from its excellent lunchtime bentos (now available at dinner) to full at home omakase meals.

Therapeutic Application Options to Gain Importance in Biobanking Industry, Notes Fact.MR Biobanks are a type of repository which is used in the storage of biological samples, including human and animal tissues, which primarily find use in research applications. Consequently, the process of biobanking has become a very important part of medical research and has played a major role in modern science fields such as personalized medications, and genomics. The global market for biobanking is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 7 per cent through the end of the forecast period in 2027. This growth will account for the sales of relevant equipment to reach a value of USD 1 billion during this period. The growth is also expected to be supported by the ongoing transition from manual to automated systems within the industry. Rapid Growth in Asia Pacific Led by Activities in China The countries in the Asia pacific region have been witnessing a substantial growth in the number of biobanks under development. Major contributors to the industry are coming from Australia, China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. Request Sample Report https://www. factmr. com/connectus/sample?flag S rep id 4438 Most of the push into biobanking in the region in recent times is coming from China, which can be attributed to regional advances in terms of the pharmaceutical industry, which has resulted in a greater demand for biospecimens for the development and production of therapeutics. In turn, the governments have also set up initiatives towards improvements of existent infrastructure with the aid of additional funding, which will play a major role in the expanding scope of the industry. Further China is also witnessing a major increase in the number of biobanks, which will increase the demand for relevant equipment and services. With the substantial growth of the Chinese biobanking industry, the Asia Pacific region has been projected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 8 per cent throughout the forecast period. Temperature Control Equipment Gain Greater Traction The rising number of biobanks on a global scale are responsible for the higher demand of efficient storage equipment including varieties of biospecimens including nucleic acids, blood, tissues, and cells. Consequently, the sales of temperature control equipment such as freezers used for the preservation of such specimens is expected to witness greater traction in the years ahead. Read Report Overview https://www. factmr. com/report/4438/biobanking market On the other hand, the high expenses related to the tech advancements in terms of equipment and services are expected to remain a major challenge for manufacturers and service providers, which in turn increase operational costs for biobanks. In addition, the high costs of infrastructure, supplies, equipment, and trained professionals are also key to the restrained adoption rates for biobanks. The Growth of Therapeutics is Key to Future Development Across the global pharmaceutical industry, manufacturers have been increasingly opting for biospecimens over chemicals for the development of therapeutic options for the treatment of rare and chronic disorders. This trend is expected to increase the demand for samples of human cells, blood, and tissues, for the development of regenerative medications. Consequently, the demand for therapeutics, and biospecimens for clinical diagnosis will grow in the years to come, strengthening sales figures in the industry.

Attachment Exemption NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Docket No. 50 293 Holtec Pilgrim, LLC Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station Exemption I. Background By letter dated November 10, 2015 (Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML15328A053), Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (ENOI) certified to the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that it planned to permanently cease power operations at Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station (Pilgrim) no later than June 1, 2019 . On May 31, 2019 , ENOI permanently ceased power operations at Pilgrim. By letter dated June 10, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19161A033), ENOI certified to the NRC that the fuel was permanently removed from the Pilgrim reactor vessel and placed in the spent fuel pool (SFP) on June 9, 2019 . Accordingly, pursuant to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) Section 50.82(a)(2), the Pilgrim renewed facility operating license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention of fuel in the reactor vessel. The facility is still authorized to possess and store irradiated (i. e. , spent) nuclear fuel. Spent fuel is currently stored onsite at the Pilgrim facility in the SFP and in a dry cask independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI). II. Request/Action By letter dated March 25, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19088A127), as supplemented by letter dated July 30, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19211B509), ENOI requested an exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) concerning offsite primary and secondary liability insurance. The exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) would permit the licensee to reduce the required level of primary offsite liability insurance from 450 million to 100 million and to eliminate the requirement to carry secondary financial protection for Pilgrim. By letter dated November 16, 2018 (ADAMS Accession No. ML18320A031), ENOI, on behalf of itself and Entergy Nuclear Generation Company (ENGC) (to be known as Holtec Pilgrim, LLC ), Holtec International ( Holtec ), and Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI, the licensee) (together, Applicants), requested that the NRC consent to: (1) The indirect transfer of control of Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR 35 for Pilgrim, as well as the general license for the Pilgrim ISFSI (together, the Licenses), to Holtec and (2) the direct transfer of ENOI's operating authority (i. e. , its authority to conduct licensed activities at Pilgrim) to HDI. In addition, the Applicants requested that the NRC approve a conforming administrative amendment to the Licenses to reflect the proposed direct transfer of the Licenses from ENOI to HDI a planned name change for ENGC from ENGC to Holtec Pilgrim, LLC and deletion of certain license conditions to reflect satisfaction and termination of all ENGC obligations after the license transfer and equity sale. By Order dated August 22, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19170A265), the NRC staff approved the direct and indirect transfers requested in the November 16, 2018 application. Additionally, on August 22, 2019 , HDI informed the NRC (ADAMS Accession No. ML19234A357) that: HDI will assume responsibility for all ongoing NRC regulatory actions and reviews currently underway for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station . HDI respectfully requests NRC continuation of these regulatory actions and reviews. On August 26, 2019 , ENOI informed the NRC that the license transfer transaction closed on August 26, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19239A037). On August 27, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19235A050), the NRC staff issued Amendment No. 249 to reflect the license transfer. Accordingly, HDI is now the licensee for decommissioning operations at Pilgrim. The regulation at 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) requires each licensee to have and maintain primary financial protection in an amount of 450 million . In addition, the licensee is required to participate in an industry retrospective rating plan (secondary financial protection) that commits each licensee to pay into an insurance pool to be used for damages that may exceed primary insurance coverage. Participation in the industry retrospective rating plan will subject the licensee to deferred premium charges up to a maximum total deferred premium of 131,056,000 with respect to any nuclear incident at any operating nuclear power plant and up to a maximum annual deferred premium of 20,496,000 per incident. Many of the accident scenarios postulated in the updated safety analysis reports for operating power reactors involve failures or malfunctions of systems, which could affect the fuel in the reactor core and, in the most severe postulated accidents, would involve the release of large quantities of fission products. With the permanent cessation of power operations at Pilgrim and the permanent removal of the fuel from the reactor vessel, many accidents are no longer possible. Similarly, the associated risk of offsite liability damages that would require insurance or indemnification is commensurately lower for permanently shut down and defueled plants. Therefore, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to permit a reduction in primary offsite liability insurance and to withdraw from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. III. Discussion Pursuant to 10 CFR 140.8, ""Specific exemptions,"" the Commission may, upon application of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in 10 CFR part 140 when the exemptions are authorized by law and are otherwise in the public interest. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request for an exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) and has concluded that the requested exemption is authorized by law and is otherwise in the public interest. The Price Anderson Act of 1957 (PAA) requires that nuclear power reactor licensees have insurance to compensate the public for damages arising from a nuclear incident. Specifically, the PAA requires licensees of facilities with a ""rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more"" to maintain the maximum amount of primary offsite liability insurance commercially available (currently 450 million ) and a specified amount of secondary insurance coverage (currently up to 131,056,000 per reactor). In the event of an accident causing offsite damages in excess of 450 million , each licensee would be assessed a prorated share of the excess damages, up to 131,056,000 per reactor, for a total of approximately 13 billion per nuclear incident. The NRC's regulations at 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) implement these PAA insurance requirements and set forth the amount of primary and secondary insurance each power reactor licensee must have. As noted above, the PAA requirements with respect to primary and secondary insurance and the implementing regulations at 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) apply to licensees of facilities with a ""rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more. "" In accordance with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(2), the license for a power reactor no longer authorizes operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention of fuel into the reactor vessel upon the docketing of the certifications for permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel. Therefore, the reactor cannot be used to generate power. Accordingly, a reactor that is undergoing decommissioning has no ""rated capacity. "" Thus, the NRC may take the reactor licensee out of the category of reactor licensees that are required to maintain the maximum available insurance and to participate in the secondary retrospective insurance pool. The financial protection limits of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) were established to require a licensee to maintain sufficient insurance, as specified under the PAA, to satisfy liability claims by members of the public for personal injury, property damage, and the legal cost associated with lawsuits as the result of a nuclear accident at an operating reactor with a rated capacity of 100,000 kilowatts electric or greater. Thus, the insurance levels established by this regulation, as required by the PAA, were associated with the risks and potential consequences of an accident at an operating reactor with a rated capacity of 100,000 kilowatts electric or greater. The legal and associated technical basis for granting exemptions from 10 CFR part 140 is set forth in SECY 93 127, ""Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,"" dated May 10, 1993 (ADAMS Accession No. ML12257A628). The legal analysis underlying SECY 93 127 concluded that, upon a technical finding that lesser potential hazards exist after permanent cessation of power operations (and the reactor having no ""rated capacity""), the Commission has the discretion under the PAA to reduce the amount of insurance required of a licensee undergoing decommissioning. As a technical matter, the fact that a reactor has permanently ceased power operations is not itself determinative as to whether a licensee may cease providing the offsite liability coverage required by the PAA and 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4). In light of the presence of freshly discharged irradiated fuel in the SFP at a recently shut down reactor, the potential for an offsite radiological release from a zirconium fire with consequences comparable in some respects to an operating reactor accident remains. That risk is very low at the time of reactor shutdown because of design provisions that prevent a significant reduction in coolant inventory in the SFP under normal and accident conditions and becomes no longer credible once the continual reduction in decay heat provides ample time to restore coolant inventory and permits air cooling in a drained SFP. After that time, the probability of a large offsite radiological release from a zirconium fire is negligible for permanently shutdown reactors, but the SFP is still operational and an inventory of radioactive materials still exists onsite. Therefore, an evaluation of the potential for offsite damage is necessary to determine the appropriate level of offsite insurance post shutdown, in accordance with the Commission's discretionary authority under the PAA to establish an appropriate level of required financial protection for such permanently shutdown facilities. The NRC staff has conducted an evaluation and concluded that, aside from the handling, storage, and transportation of spent fuel and radioactive materials for a permanently shutdown and defueled reactor, no reasonably conceivable potential accident exists that could cause significant offsite damage. During normal power reactor operations, the forced flow of water through the reactor coolant system (RCS) removes heat generated by the reactor. The RCS transfers this heat away from the reactor core by converting reactor feedwater to steam, which then flows to the main turbine generator to produce electricity. Most of the accident scenarios postulated for operating power reactors involve failures or malfunctions of systems that could affect the fuel in the reactor core, which in the most severe postulated accidents would involve the release of large quantities of fission products. With the permanent cessation of reactor operations at Pilgrim and the permanent removal of the fuel from the reactor core, such accidents are no longer possible. The reactor, RCS, and supporting systems no longer operate and have no function related to the storage of the irradiated fuel. Therefore, postulated accidents involving failure or malfunction of the reactor, RCS, or supporting systems are no longer applicable. During reactor decommissioning, the principal radiological risks are associated with the storage of spent fuel onsite. On a case by case basis, licensees undergoing decommissioning have been granted permission to reduce the required amount of primary offsite liability insurance coverage from 450 million to 100 million and to withdraw from the secondary insurance pool. One of the technical criteria for granting the exemption is that the possibility of a design basis event that could cause significant offsite damage has been eliminated. The NRC staff performed an evaluation of the design basis accidents for Pilgrim being permanently defueled as part of SECY 19 0078, ""Request by Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. for Exemptions from Certain Emergency Planning Requirements for the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station ,"" dated August 9, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML18347A717). ENOI has stated, and the NRC staff agrees, that while spent fuel remains in the SFP, the only postulated design basis accident that would remain applicable to Pilgrim in the permanently defueled condition that could contribute a significant dose is a fuel handling accident (FHA) in the Reactor Building , where the SFP is located. For completeness, the NRC staff also evaluated the applicability of other design basis accidents documented in the Pilgrim Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) (ADAMS Accession No. ML16083A494) to ensure that these accidents would not have consequences that could potentially exceed the 10 CFR 50.67 dose limits and Regulatory Guide 1.183, ""Alternative Radiological Source Terms for Evaluating Design Basis Accidents at Nuclear Power Reactors,"" dose acceptance criteria or approach the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) early phase protective action guides (PAGs). In the Pilgrim UFSAR, the licensee has determined that within 46 days after shutdown, the FHA doses would decrease to a level that would not warrant protective actions under the EPA early phase PAG framework, notwithstanding meeting the dose limit requirements under 10 CFR 50.67 and dose acceptance criteria under Regulatory Guide 1.183. The NRC staff notes that the doses from an FHA are dominated by the isotope Iodine 131. Pilgrim permanently ceased power operations on May 31, 2019 . With 10 months of decay, the thyroid dose from an FHA would be negligible. After 10 months of decay, the only isotope remaining in significant amounts, among those postulated to be released in a design basis FHA, would be Krypton 85. Since Krypton 85 primarily decays by beta emission, the calculated skin dose from an FHA analysis would make an insignificant contribution to the total effective dose equivalent (TEDE), which is the parameter of interest in the determination of the EPA early phase PAGs for sheltering or evacuation. The NRC staff concludes that the dose consequence from an FHA for the permanently shutdown Pilgrim would not approach the EPA early phase PAGs. Therefore, any offsite consequence from a design basis radiological release is highly unlikely and, thus, a significant amount of offsite liability insurance coverage is not required. The only beyond design basis event that has the potential to lead to a significant radiological release at a permanently shutdown and defueled reactor is a zirconium fire. The zirconium fire scenario is a postulated, but highly unlikely, accident scenario that involves the loss of water inventory from the SFP resulting in a significant heatup of the spent fuel and culminating in substantial zirconium cladding oxidation and fuel damage. The probability of a zirconium fire scenario is related to the decay heat of the irradiated fuel stored in the SFP. Therefore, the risks from a zirconium fire scenario continue to decrease as a function of the time that Pilgrim has been permanently shut down. In the analysis provided in Attachment 2, ""Calculation No. PNPS EC 81416 M1418, Adiabatic Heatup Analysis for Drained Spent Fuel Pool ,"" to the letter dated February 18, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19056A260), the licensee compared the conditions for the hottest fuel assembly stored in the SFP to a criterion proposed in SECY 99 168, ""Improving Decommissioning Regulations for Nuclear Power Plants,"" dated June 30, 1999 (ADAMS Accession No. ML12265A598), applicable to offsite emergency response for the unit in the decommissioning process. This criterion considers the time for the hottest assembly to heat up from 30 degrees Celsius ( degrees C) to 900 degrees C adiabatically. If the heatup time is greater than 10 hours, then offsite emergency preplanning involving the plant is not necessary. Based on the limiting fuel assembly for decay heat and adiabatic heatup analysis presented in Attachment 2, at 10 months after permanent cessation of power operations (i. e. , 10 months of decay time), the time for the hottest fuel assembly to reach 900 degrees C is 10 hours after the assemblies have been uncovered. As stated in NUREG 1738, ""Technical Study of Spent Fuel Pool Accident Risk at Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants,"" dated February 2001 (ADAMS Accession No. ML010430066), 900 degrees C is an acceptable temperature to use for assessing onset of fission product release under transient conditions to establish the critical decay time for determining the availability of 10 hours for deployment of mitigation equipment and, if necessary, for offsite agencies to take appropriate action to protect the health and safety of the public if fuel and cladding oxidation occurs in air. The NRC staff reviewed the calculation to verify that important physical properties of materials were within acceptable ranges and the results were accurate. The NRC staff determined that physical properties were appropriate. Therefore, the NRC staff found that 10 months after permanent cessation of power operations, more than 10 hours would be available before a significant offsite release could begin. The NRC staff concluded that the adiabatic heatup calculation provided an acceptable method for determining the minimum time available for deployment of mitigation equipment and, if necessary, implementing measures under a comprehensive general emergency plan. In this regard, one technical criterion for relieving decommissioning reactor licensees from the insurance obligations applicable to an operating reactor is a finding that the heat generated by the SFP has decayed to the point where the possibility of a zirconium fire is highly unlikely. This was addressed in SECY 93 127, where the NRC staff concluded that there was a low likelihood and reduced short term public health consequences of a zirconium fire once a decommissioning plant's spent fuel has sufficiently decayed. In its Staff Requirements Memorandum, ""Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants during Decommissioning,"" dated July 13, 1993 (ADAMS Accession No. ML003760936), the Commission approved a policy that authorized, through the exemption process, withdrawal from participation in the secondary insurance layer and a reduction in commercial liability insurance coverage to 100 million when a licensee is able to demonstrate that the spent fuel could be air cooled if the SFP was drained of water. The NRC staff has used this technical criterion to grant similar exemptions to other decommissioning reactors (e. g. , Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station , published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1999 (64 FR 2920) Zion Nuclear Power Station , published in the Federal Register on December 28, 1999 (64 FR 72700) Kewaunee Power Station , published in the Federal Register on March 24, 2015 (80 FR 15638) Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Generation Plant, published in the Federal Register on May 6, 2015 (80 FR 26100) and Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station , published in the Federal Register on December 28, 2018 (83 FR 67365)). Additional discussions of other decommissioning reactor licensees that have received exemptions to reduce their primary insurance level to 100 million are provided in SECY 96 256, ""Changes to the Financial Protection Requirements for Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors, 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 140.11,"" dated December 17, 1996 (ADAMS Accession No. ML15062A483). These prior exemptions were based on the licensee demonstrating that the SFP could be air cooled consistent with the technical criterion discussed above. The NRC staff has evaluated the issue of zirconium fires in SFPs and presented an independent evaluation of an SFP subject to a severe earthquake in NUREG 2161, ""Consequence Study of a Beyond Design Basis Earthquake Affecting the Spent Fuel Pool for a U. S. Mark l Boiling Water Reactor,"" dated September 2014 (ADAMS Accession No. ML14255A365). This evaluation concluded that, for a representative boiling water reactor, fuel in a dispersed high density configuration would be adequately cooled by natural circulation air flow within several months after discharge from a reactor if the pool was drained of water. By letter dated July 30, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19211B509), ENOI provided a supplement to its exemption request addressing air cooling of fuel in a drained SFP. In the attachment to this letter, the licensee compared Pilgrim fuel storage parameters with those used in NRC generic evaluations of fuel cooling included in NUREG/CR 6451, ""A Safety and Regulatory Assessment of Generic BWR Boiling Water Reactor and PWR Pressurized Water Reactor Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Plants,"" dated August 1997 (ADAMS Accession No. ML082260098). The analysis described in NUREG/CR 6451 determined that natural air circulation would adequately cool fuel that has decayed for 7 months after operation in a typical BWR. The licensee compared the post shutdown fuel storage conditions with those assumed for the analysis presented in NUREG/CR 6451. The licensee found that the Pilgrim fuel storage configuration is nearly identical to the representative configuration used in the NUREG/CR 6451 analysis with respect to the fuel assembly size, the fuel storage pitch, the rack material, and the rack orifice size being larger than the BWR fuel assembly inlet nozzle size. Thus, the cooling air flow should be comparable. However, although the Pilgrim final cycle fuel operated at a lower power density, it achieved a higher total burnup than assumed for the NUREG/CR 6451 analysis. The licensee determined that the higher decay heat resulting from the increased burnup would be offset by the longer decay time (i. e. , 10 months) at the effective date of the requested exemption as compared to the decay time used in the NUREG/CR 6451 analysis (i. e. , 7 months), which results in a lower total decay heat rate. Therefore, at 10 months after permanent shutdown (i. e. , the effective date of the requested exemption), the NRC staff has reasonable assurance that fuel stored in the Pilgrim SFP would be adequately air cooled in the unlikely event the SFP completely drained. In SECY 00 0145, ""Integrated Rulemaking Plan for Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning,"" dated June 28, 2000 , and SECY 01 0100, ""Policy Issues Related to Safeguards, Insurance, and Emergency Preparedness Regulations at Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants Storing Fuel in Spent Fuel Pools,"" dated June 4, 2001 (ADAMS Accession Nos. ML003721626 and ML011450420, respectively), the NRC staff discussed additional information concerning SFP zirconium fire risks at decommissioning reactors and associated implications for offsite insurance. Analyzing when the spent fuel stored in the SFP is capable of adequate air cooling is one measure that demonstrates when the probability of a zirconium fire would be exceedingly low. In addition, the licensee performed adiabatic heatup analyses in which a complete drainage of the SFP is combined with rearrangement of spent fuel rack geometry and/or the addition of rubble to the SFP this type of analysis postulates that decay heat transfer from the spent fuel via conduction, convection, or radiation would be impeded. The licensee's adiabatic heatup analyses demonstrate that 10 months after the permanent cessation of operations, there would be at least 10 hours after the loss of all means of cooling (both air and/or water) before the spent fuel cladding would reach a temperature where the potential for a significant offsite radiological release could occur. In the March 25, 2019 , application, ENOI furnished the following information: ""Based on the length of time it would take for the adiabatic heat up to occur, there is ample time to respond to any partial drain down event that might cause such an occurrence by restoring SFP cooling or makeup, or providing SFP spray. As a result, the likelihood that such a scenario would progress to a zirconium fire is deemed not credible. "" In the NRC staff's evaluation contained in SECY 19 0078, the NRC staff assessed the ENOI accident analyses associated with the radiological risks from a zirconium fire at a permanently shut down and defueled Pilgrim site. For the highly unlikely beyond design basis accident scenario where the SFP coolant inventory is lost in such a manner that all methods of heat removal from the spent fuel are no longer available, the NRC staff found ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hat there will be a minimum of 10 hours from the initiation of the accident until the cladding reaches a temperature where offsite radiological release might occur. The NRC staff finds that 10 hours is sufficient time to support deployment of mitigation equipment, consistent with plant conditions, the NRC staff notes that similar exemptions from these insurance requirements have been granted to other permanently shut down and defueled power reactors upon satisfactory demonstration that zirconium fire risk from the irradiated fuel stored in the SFP is of negligible concern. A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law The PAA and its implementing regulations in 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) require licensees of nuclear reactors that have a rated capacity of 100,000 kilowatts electric or more to have and maintain 450 million in primary financial protection and to participate in a secondary retrospective insurance pool. In accordance with 10 CFR 140.8, the Commission may grant exemptions from the regulations in 10 CFR part 140 as the Commission determines are authorized by law. The legal and associated technical basis for granting exemptions from 10 CFR part 140 are set forth in SECY 93 127. The legal analysis underlying SECY 93 127 concluded that, upon a technical finding that lesser potential hazards exist after permanent cessation of operations, the Commission has the discretion under the PAA to reduce the amount of insurance required of a licensee undergoing decommissioning. Based on its review of the exemption request, the NRC staff concludes that the technical criteria for relieving Holtec Pilgrim and HDI from their existing primary and secondary insurance obligations have been met. As explained above, the NRC staff has concluded that no reasonably conceivable design basis accident exists that could cause an offsite release greater than the EPA PAGs and, therefore, that any offsite consequence from a design basis radiological release is highly unlikely and the need for a significant amount of offsite liability insurance coverage is unwarranted. Additionally, the NRC staff determined that, after 10 months decay, the fuel stored in the Pilgrim SFP will be capable of being adequately cooled by air in the highly unlikely event of pool drainage. Moreover, in the highly unlikely beyond design basis accident scenario where the SFP coolant inventory is lost in such a manner that all methods of heat removal from the spent fuel are no longer available, the NRC staff has determined that at least 10 hours would be available and is sufficient time to support deployment of mitigation equipment, consistent with plant conditions, to prevent the zirconium cladding from reaching a point of rapid oxidation. Thus, the NRC staff concludes that the fuel stored in the Pilgrim SFP will have decayed sufficiently by the requested effective date for the exemption of 10 months after permanent cessation of power operations to support a reduction in the required insurance consistent with SECY 00 0145. The NRC staff has determined that granting the licensee's proposed exemption will not result in a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Section 170, or other laws, as amended, which require licensees to maintain adequate financial protection. Accordingly, consistent with the legal standard presented in SECY 93 127, under which decommissioning reactor licensees may be relieved of the requirements to carry the maximum amount of insurance available and to participate in the secondary retrospective premium pool where there is sufficient technical justification, the NRC staff concludes that the requested exemption is authorized by law. B. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest The financial protection limits of 10 CFR 140.11 were established to require licensees to maintain sufficient offsite liability insurance to ensure adequate funding for offsite liability claims following an accident at an operating reactor. However, the regulation does not consider the reduced potential for and consequence of nuclear incidents at permanently shutdown and decommissioning reactors. The basis provided in SECY 93 127, SECY 00 0145, and SECY 01 0100 allows licensees of decommissioning plants to reduce their primary offsite liability insurance and to withdraw from participation in the retrospective rating pool for deferred premium charges. As discussed in these documents, once the zirconium fire concern is determined to be negligible, possible accident scenario risks at permanently shutdown and defueled reactors are greatly reduced when compared to the risks at operating reactors and the associated potential for offsite financial liabilities from an accident are commensurately less. The licensee analyzed and the NRC staff confirmed that the risks of accidents that could result in an offsite radiological risk are minimal, thereby justifying the proposed reductions in offsite primary liability insurance and withdrawal from participation in the secondary retrospective rating pool for deferred premium charges. Additionally, participation in the secondary retrospective rating pool could potentially have adverse consequences on the safe and timely completion of decommissioning. If a nuclear incident sufficient to trigger the secondary insurance layer occurred at another nuclear power plant, the licensee could incur financial liability of up to 131,56,000 . However, because Pilgrim is permanently shut down, it cannot produce revenue from electricity generation sales to cover such a liability. Therefore, such liability if subsequently incurred could significantly affect the ability of the facility to conduct and complete timely radiological decontamination and decommissioning activities. In addition, as SECY 93 127 concluded, the shared financial risk exposure to the licensee is greatly disproportionate to the radiological risk posed by Pilgrim when compared to operating reactors. The reduced overall risk to the public at decommissioning power plants does not warrant that the licensee be required to carry full operating reactor insurance coverage after the requisite spent fuel cooling period has elapsed following final reactor shutdown. The licensee's proposed financial protection limits will maintain a level of liability insurance coverage commensurate with the risk to the public. These changes are consistent with previous NRC policy as discussed in SECY 00 0145 and exemptions approved for other decommissioning reactors. Thus, the underlying purpose of the regulations will not be adversely affected by the reductions in insurance coverage. Accordingly, an exemption from participation in the secondary insurance pool and a reduction in the primary insurance to 100 million , a value more in line with the potential consequences of accidents, would be in the public interest in that this ensures that there will be adequate funds to address any of those consequences and helps to ensure the safe and timely decommissioning of the reactor. Therefore, the NRC staff has concluded that an exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4), which would permit Holtec Pilgrim and HDI to lower the Pilgrim primary insurance levels and to withdraw from the secondary retrospective premium pool at the requested effective date of 10 months after permanent cessation of power operations, is in the public interest. C. Environmental Considerations The NRC's approval of an exemption from insurance or indemnity requirements belongs to a category of actions that the Commission, by rule or regulation, has declared to be a categorical exclusion after first finding that the category of actions does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Specifically, the exemption is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25). Under 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25), granting of an exemption from the requirements of any regulation of Chapter I to 10 CFR is a categorical exclusion provided that: (i) There is no significant hazards consideration (ii) there is no significant change in the types or significant increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite (iii) there is no significant increase in individual or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure (iv) there is no significant construction impact (v) there is no significant increase in the potential for or consequences from radiological accidents and (vi) the requirements from which an exemption is sought involve surety, insurance, or indemnity requirements. As the Director, Division of Operating Reactor Licensing , Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation , I have determined that approval of the exemption request involves no significant hazards consideration, as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, because reducing a licensee's offsite liability requirements at Pilgrim does not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The exempted financial protection regulation is unrelated to the operation of Pilgrim or site activities. Accordingly, there is no significant change in the types or significant increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite and no significant increase in individual or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure. The exempted regulation is not associated with construction so there is no significant construction impact. The exempted regulation does not concern the source term (i. e. , potential amount of radiation in an accident) nor any activities conducted at the site. Therefore, there is no significant increase in the potential for, or consequences of, a radiological accident. In addition, there would be no significant impacts to biota, water resources, historic properties, cultural resources, or socioeconomic conditions in the region resulting from issuance of the requested exemption. The requirement for offsite liability insurance involves surety, insurance, or indemnity matters only. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b) and 51.22(c)(25), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared in connection with the approval of this exemption request. IV. Conclusions Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 140.8, the exemption is authorized by law and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Holtec Pilgrim and HDI an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) for Pilgrim. Pilgrim permanently ceased power operations on May 31, 2019 . The exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) permits Pilgrim to reduce the required level of primary financial protection from 450 million to 100 million and to withdraw from participation in the secondary layer of financial protection 10 months after permanent cessation of power operations. The exemption is effective as of 10 months after permanent cessation of power operations. Dated at Rockville, Maryland , this 6th day of January 2020 . For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .

Online condolences may be sent at www. tyreefuneralhome. com For National Bagel Day, Forward staffers share their favorite spots Bagels: we wait on line for them, we spend entire Sundays enjoying them, we gobble them on the subway in our darkest hours while strangers wrinkle their noses at poppy seeds cascading to the floor. Bagels are central to American Jewish life. Scratch that, they re central to American life. Actually, this year scientists uncovered Bronze Age mini bagels in Austria, so let s just go ahead and say bagels are central to human existence. Perhaps because of their near primal significance, throwing around phrases like best bagel place turns out to be a great way to start a fight. On Twitter, advocating unorthodox bagel slicing practices can render you an overnight pariah. If you admit to buying bagels at a chain, someone will immediately inform you that said chain has Nazi connections. And Americans who unironically refer themselves as citizens of the world may turn into unabashed xenophobes if told that it s possible to get a decent bagel in Montreal. This National Bagel Day, we want to usher in a new age of bagel d tente. So instead of slamming down hot takes, we re sharing the bagel places that have succored and sustained Forward staff, from our hometowns across the country to our current neighborhoods. We re not telling you what to do, merely giving some friendly hints much like Timoth e Chalamet handing out Tompkins Square Bagels on the red carpet, but without those fabulous eyebrows. Here s what our staffers have to say. Jodi Rudoren, Editor in Chief Hot Bagels Abroad, Monclair, N. J. : I have barely eaten a full bagel since 2011, but we live back to back with this little shop, and the boiled then baked smell every time I pull in the driveway gives me a bagel fix without the carbs. Also, I m there around 6:30 a. m. most mornings getting a plain, a little bit of butter for my son s lunchbox, and they ask every time if I want a receipt (no). Rachel Fishman Feddersen, CEO Publisher O Bagel, Montreal, Canada: Best one I ever had (sorry to say) was at O Bagel in the Jean Talon market. Chana Pollack, Archivist Monticello Bagel Bakery, Monticello, N. Y. : This is my local Upstate New York joint, on East Broadway in the old capital town of the Borscht Belt, complete with drive through window! Fresh and hot is how I like to have these, straight out of the bag they re packed in no cheese nor butter shmear necessary. And should you choose to hunker down and eat in at this half century old family owned joint, you will enjoy true archival bagel bakery atmosphere which is to say, a couple of tables, some chairs and an old rumpled up newspaper for company. Deb Greenberg, Development Operations Manager Absolute Bagels, Upper West Side: They have have the best texture chewy on the inside, crusty on the outside and just the right size. Also, they carry egg bagels! Almost no one has those anymore. John Kunza, Audience Editor Bagel Pub, Crown Heights: Yes, they have the hipster vibe price markup but the fresh lox classic made with cucumber dill cream cheese on an everything bagel is a godsend on most Sunday mornings (or afternoons if we are being honest). Molly Boigon, Investigative Reporter Kehillath Israel, Brookline, Mass. : The best bagel in America is served at around noon after Shabbat morning services at Kehillath Israel, a synagogue in Brookline, MA. The bagel itself is standard soft on the inside, chewy on the outside, ideally eaten with a slab of cream cheese. But munch on the bagel while sitting around a table and catching up with the friendly group of 20 somethings that gathers there, feel the sun stream in and ignite the light wood paneled floor. Then, slip upstairs to the balcony of the sanctuary, good book in hand, and listen to the chatter downstairs fade into the rest of the day. You ll never have a better bagel. Bagel Express III, Kips Bay: A great runner up. Grab a sesame seed bagel toasted with scallion cream cheese, a mango Naked juice and sit by the door to nurse your punishing hangover. P. J. Grisar, Culture Fellow Bagel Boys, Airmont, N. Y. : Each year at the Yom Kippur break fast, we rely on my aunt and uncle to import our bagels from near their home in Suffern in Rockland County. Having come of age in something of a bagel desert, this is as close to a hometown carb ring as I have. (Pity me. ) Still, for me they have that Proust s madeleine quality, transporting me to hunger pang days of Yom Kippurs past. They keep pretty well in the freezer, too, and there are usually some stragglers in the fridge when I make a homecoming. H H Bagels, Upper East Side: Jaded New Yorkers like to say this legendary bagelry has declined in quality since the Koch administration. But should they ask me how they re doing, I would answer: just fine. (Then again, I was born during the Dinkins years. ) Still a good, dependable, if overly dense and stuffed to excess bagel. The Sunday morning lines prove that there s still something special about this place, where, in the 80s, a worker once sagely refused to put tuna on my father s cinnamon raisin bagel. Here s a pro tip: You can order pickup on Seamless and breeze by the queued up yuppie masses. As that H H employee said to my gobsmacked dad after he selected a less exotic vehicle for his tuna fish excellent choice. Kia Davis, Executive Assistant Leo s Bagels, Financial Disrict: I am not a huge bagel fan but, since I ve been here my coworkers have introduced me to some very good bagels from Leo s, not too far from the office. I ve been there a few times and I think slowly but surely converting. My favorite bagel to get is an everything bagel toasted with plain cream cheese. Talya Zax, Deputy Culture Editor (The erstwhile) Nagel s Bagels, Crown Heights: For a couple years the pleasure of my life was my Sunday pumpernickel everything with whitefish at Nagel s Bagels on Lincoln road. Yes, the store was always weirdly filled with smoke yes, the bagels were looked down on by certain Manhattanites. But they were just dense enough, with wonderful strong but not tough crusts, and they were mine. Then Nagel s closed with no warning one weekend the grate stayed down over the store, and that was it. My neighborhood has low bagel density, so now I am forced to go to Bergen Bagel. It is smoke free, but it will never have my heart. Alyssa Fisher, News Writer Audience Engagement Associate Knickerbocker Bagel, Bushwick: I moved to Brooklyn two years ago this month, and that first weekend I eagerly scrolled Yelp for a true New York bagel shop. I found it around the corner from my empty apartment at Knickerbocker Bagel, and I was instantly hooked. I didn t realize how deprived I was living in Florida, with its thin, crunchy bagels that weren t ordered alone, but rather came as a side dish to an egg platter. At Knickerbocker Bagel, I learned what a bagel should be like: warm, with a fluffy center and perfectly browned crust. My first order, a sesame bagel lightly toasted sorry! with lox spread, became my staple. Expect a long line, but boy, it s worth it. (I even wrote a little ode to it. ) Too Jay s, Fort Lauderdale, Fla. : In Florida, bagels alone aren t breakfast. They re thin, crunchy and come in a plastic bin next to your eggs or pancakes (seriously), and you have to schmear it yourself. However, it s what we know and we love it. But going to Too Jay s was always a treat their bagels beat all the other delis and diners in South Florida. Irene Katz Connelly, Audience Engagement Intern H H bagels, Upper East Side: When my parents were dating, my father came into New York City from New Jersey every weekend and brought my mother bagels from H H. I myself have never eaten an H H bagel, but given how difficult it is these days to induce my father to come to New York ( the parking! ) they must be good. Ari Feldman, Staff Writer Brooklyn Bagel, East Village: My ideal Saturday starts with a trip to Brooklyn Bagel on 8th Street and one of their everything bagels, toasted at least twice! depending on how hot the bagel was to start with and positively shmeared with dill pickle cream cheese. Rise Bagel Co, Minneapolis, Minn. : I was born and raised in Minnesota, where Jewish appetizing culture is lacking, compared to New York. (My mother has long fantasized about opening an appetizing shop called The Hungry Jew. ) Recently, however, bagels have become a subject of culinary interest in the Twin Cities, and on a recent visit home my family and I engaged in a blind taste test of four bagel purveyors. The verdict: Rise, in Minneapolis. Though too small and not crusty enough for my taste, they had a strong yeasty flavor and a fluffy crumb with the right amount of chew. Roberta Caplan, National Director of Gifts and Events Tal Bagels, Upper East Side: Everything is fresh and they have whole wheat flat bagels! Gabby Brooks, Marketing Intern Ize s Deli Bagelry, Rockville, Md. : Located in a small, always packed shop on the Rockville Pike, Ize s reminds me of New York when I m back home. I know it s truly the breakfast of champions because Maryland s own Olympic star Katie Ledecky calls it one of her favorite places and the shop even has an omelet named after her. Bagels on the Square, Greenwich Village: Bagels on the Square is not the best bagel in the village, or probably even within a flew blocks radius from NYU, but it is the best bagel in my heart. There s something about the ridiculous number of bottled drink offerings and the sad, plastic wrapped muffins that is extremely comforting after submitting a twenty page sociology paper and running on nothing but Argo s green tea. Get a bagel, sit in Father Demo Square, and watch all the West Village toddlers in strollers that cost more than your rent go by. Forverts If you re up to it, why not make your own bagels following the recipe below (with English subtitles). Irene Katz Connelly is an intern at the Forward.

The victim was trying to cross Rockville Pike in the 12200 block when he was struck by a Nissan Sentra driven by a 28 year old Rockville man, according to a preliminary investigation by Montgomery County Police. Police responded shortly after 8:40 p. m. Authorities identified the victim as Michael Louis Gamboa, of Gaithersburg. He was taken to a hospital, where he died. The driver remained on the scene after the crash. He was not injured. Detectives are continuing to investigate. Anyone who may have seen the crash or who has additional information is asked to call the Collision Reconstruction Unit at 240 773 6620 Montgomery County leaders plan road safety town hall after recent pedestrian deaths Leaders in Montgomery County, Maryland, are reaching out to residents to hear their concerns and suggestions for how to keep pedestrians and cyclists safe. Despite Montgomery County, Maryland, being one of the first county governments in the U. S. to create a Vision Zero plan, a recent spate of pedestrian deaths involved two just this week on Rockville Pike. Numbers of other crashes have seen pedestrians or cyclists seriously injured. Now, Montgomery County leaders are reaching out to residents to hear their concerns and suggestions for how to keep pedestrians and cyclists safe. A town hall meeting is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 9 at 2 p. m. in Wheaton. Additional details will be released as they become available, but a news release from the Montgomery County Council said that the goal of the meeting is for leaders to hear directly from residents about safety issues they are seeing on roadways, sidewalks and in crosswalks. County leaders are committed to continuously reevaluating what we are doing in this area and providing the necessary resources for improvements, Council President Sidney Katz said in the release. As a council, we will continue to work with our residents, advocacy groups, and planning, transportation and public safety experts to find new and innovative ways to expand our pedestrian safety measures and revamp and enhance our public education campaigns to truly make our community a safe place to walk, bike and commute using multimodal transportation options, Katz said. More immediately, a briefing and update on the county s Vision Zero plan will take place at the council s meeting Tuesday, Jan. 28. The council will host representatives from the police department, county school system, the county s Department of Transportation, Park and Planning Commission and Maryland State Highway Administration.  Week Ahead: County Council to discuss bike registration, solar arrays County Council to discuss bike registration, solar arrays The Montgomery County Council will discuss bike registration laws and solar arrays during a busy Tuesday session. Council Members Tom Hucker, Will Jawando, Evan Glass and Hans Riemer will introduce changes to an ordinance that requires residents to register their bicycles with the county. Unregistered bicycles can be confiscated by police under the current law, which council members want to amend. The revised ordinance would make registration voluntary and remove language that allows Montgomery County police to deposit sales from impounded bicycles into an officer retirement fund. Riemer and Hucker are scheduled to introduce a bill that would allow larger solar arrays on the county s agricultural reserve land. Council members will also vote on a bill to require landlords to supply air conditioning in some circumstances. In the evening, they ll hold a public hearing on a community policing bill that would set new guidelines and policies for local law enforcement. The daytime portion of the session is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a. m. The evening public hearing will begin at 7:30 p. m. Both will take place in the third floor hearing room of the Council Office Building at 100 Maryland Ave. in Rockville. Gaithersburg to hold public hearing on local gun law On Tuesday, the Gaithersburg mayor and council will hold a public hearing on amendments to the city s current firearm laws. The amendments would make the city s ordinances more consistent with state laws and expand the prohibition against possession of weapons on city streets. The new ordinance would explicitly prohibit the possession of weapons on all public property, including churches, schools, and other places of public assembly. The council session is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p. m. in Gaithersburg City Hall at 31 S. Summit Ave. Planning Board to discuss Vision Zero plan The Montgomery County Planning Board on Thursday will discuss the county s Vision Zero work plan and additional funding for a program that would allow staff members to analyze data to better predict crashes. The county s Vision Zero plan aims to significantly reduce or eliminate traffic related fatalities by 2030. The program called predictive safety analysis uses traffic data to anticipate which roads are more likely to have severe crashes. The analysis makes it easier to suggest and implement safety improvements on dangerous roads. Three pedestrians have been struck and killed in Montgomery County since the start of the year, including two fatalities on Rockville Pike within 24 hours. The board will meet at 9 a. m. in MRO Auditorium at 8787 Georgia Ave. in Silver Spring.  Breakfast links: Some Metro riders experienced a bit of post-strike bus confusion Nicole Cacozza is a native Washingtonian, former ANC Commissioner, and current Adams Morgan resident.

Times have obviously changed, and one small silver lining: now you can get these classics old and new delivered to your door or for pickup. 2 Amys deviled eggs with green sauce 3715 Macomb St. , NW Sure, 2 Amys is one of DC s most popular pizzerias for a reason (the Neapolitan pizzas). But! We ve always loved the sophisticated, unfussy small plates heavy on anchovies, cured meats, and seasonal gems as much as the Neapolitan pies. These jammy eggs with herbaceous salsa verde always steal the show. Order online for pickup. A J dim sum 1319 Rockville Pike, Rockville 4316 Markham St. , Annandale We ve spent many a weekend waiting for a coveted table outside these tiny, family run Chinese spots (also: seeking out an ATM for the cash only rule).

Bad Saint 3226 11th St. , NW Who would have thought this tiny, ultra popular Filipino restaurant would package their line standing dishes to go? The takeout menu (served Thursday through Saturday) changes so often it s hard to pinpoint one item, but the punchy, creative flavors we ve come to expect are all there. Past dishes include crab fat noodles, spring rolls, and pork belly. There s also an online marketplace with homemade chili sauces, noodles, CSA boxes, and more. Order online. Beteseb vegetable platter and rib eye tibs 8201 Georgia Ave. , Silver Spring Ethiopian food travels beautifully, and out of all the options, we re partial to this family run restaurant in Silver Spring. Go for rib eye tibs saut ed with onion and green pepper and the heaping vegetarian platter. For the brave: the kitfo (tartare like minced raw beef) is superb. Call for pickup. Cane tiffin boxes 403 H St. , NE We loved crowding around the tables at chef Peter Prime s small H Street dining room pre Covid. The menu hasn t changed much for takeout a good thing and the tiffin boxes are a great way to go for both sampling and travel (curries generally carry well). Pick between omnivore or vegetarian, both loaded with curries, chutneys, and homemade bread. Order online for pickup. Columbia Room cocktails 124 Blagden Alley, NW Derek Brown s classy cocktail destination has been packaging seasonal drinks to go since the stat of the pandemic (and unlike some of the straightforward cocktails on the takeout market, good luck creating these at home). For January, Brown also has non alcoholic creations. If you re hungry, check out Your Only Friend sandwich pop up. Order online for pickup and delivery. Compass Rose khachupuri 1346 T St. , NW Rose Previte s 14th Street dining room certainly didn t invent the decadent Georgian cheese bread, but it can claim responsibility for popularizing it to Jumbo Slice level proportions in the minds of hungry Washingtonians. Instead of a server mixing molten cheese, egg, and butter inside the canoe shaped bread table side, the takeout version comes with instructions for doing it at home. Order online for takeout. The Dabney catfish sliders 122 Blagden Alley NW You ll have to order a three course menu ( 45) to get chef Jeremiah Langhorne s previously off menu crispy catfish sandwich but the addictive bite is worth it. Other seasonal dishes like barbecue chicken don t sound shabby, either. Order online for takeout and delivery. Daikaya ramen 705 Sixth St. , NW Daikaya s siblings all jumped onto the takeout wagon pre pandemic, including chicken centric Bantam King and Navy Yard s Hatoba.

Fiola Mare lobster ravioli 3100 K St. , NW It s always a special (re: very expensive) splurge to dine at Fabio Trabbochi s Georgetown restaurant. Takeout and delivery are no different. Does 60 ravioli to go seem insanely indulgent? Yes. But these ravioli come stuffed with lobster, half a tail, and a velvety lobster sauce. And they cost a fraction of that vacation you re not taking. Order online for pickup and delivery. Hank s Oyster Bar lobster roll Locations in Dupont Circle, the Wharf, Capitol Hill Over a decade later, our favorite item on chef Jamie Leeds menu is the lobster roll packed with sweet meat is on the menu of classics. For a side, go for the ultra creamy mac n cheese or lobster bisque. Available for pickup or delivery. Jaleo gambas al ajillo Locations in Penn Quarter, Bethesda, and Crystal City This simple yet delicious dish of garlicky shrimp debuted with Jose Andres first Jaleo in Penn Quarter 27 years ago and there s a reason its been on the menu of every Jaleo since.

Kinship roast chicken 1015 Seventh St. , NW Chef Eric Ziebold s fancy roast chicken strutted onto the scene when the luxe poultry trend was just beginning and it s still one of the best.

Komi pita bread 1509 17th St. , NW Chef Johnny Monis closed his fine dining destination at the start of the pandemic and reopened as Happy Gyro, a veggie centric ode his family s Greek diner. The menu of pizzas and sandwiches looks a lot different, but the homemade, ethereal pita breads that accompanied every Komi feast can be ordered as gyro sandwiches (we love the vegetarian and lamb) or solo to start the meal (go ahead and splurge on the barrel aged feta with it). Another thing we re psyched to see on the go: sommelier Kyle Wilson s carefully curated wines, beers, and ciders. Order online for pickup. Maketto fried chicken 1351 H St. , NE Chef Erik Bruner Yang isn t a newcomer to the takeout platform and that s a good thing for consistency s sake.

Le Diplomate cheeseburger Am ricain 1601 14th St. , NW Le Dip s burger is basically a cheffy riff on le Big Mac: two diner style, dry aged patties, creamy special sauce, pickles, and onions on a homemade brioche bun. It ll cost you 20 these days (with ultra crispy fries) but it s a meal in itself. Unless, like us, you re tempted by the brasserie s sleeper hit: the buttery shrimp salad. Available for takeout or delivery on multiple platforms. Little Serow whiskey pork ribs 1511 17th St. , NW In the old days, you d have to wait in line and then sweat through a fiery, multi course meal to reach Serow s pork y pinnacle: charred, whiskey marinated ribs.

Padaek/Thip Khao crispy coconut rice salad 6395 Seven Corners Center, Falls Church 3462 14th St. , NW Chef Seng Luangrath and Bobby Pradacith s Lao restaurants in DC and Falls Church are both open for takeout.

Available for carryout from Padaek order online for Thip Khao. Peking Gourmet Inn Peking duck 6029 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church The Peking duck at Eddie Tsui s Falls Church mainstay became so popular in the 80s that the family opened their own farm in Purcelville, Virginia to grow thousands of pounds of spring onions to accompany the crackling skinned bird and homemade pancakes.

Pho 75 1 pho 1721 Wilson Blvd, Arlington 771 Hungerford Dr, Rockville These soup parlors were ladeling no frills, soul warming bowls of Vietnamese pho long before the dish became trendy. You won t find large, varied menus just the soup, with extras like Vietnamese ice coffee. We re fans of the 1, floating with eye round steak, flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe plus heaps of herbs. Call for pickup cash only. The Prime Rib prime rib 2020 K St. , NW With a dress code policy and tagline like the civilized steakhouse, we were surprised to see this K Street stalwart offer takeout.

Order here for pickup and delivery. Rappahannock Oyster Bar oysters on the half shell 1150 Maine Ave. , SW We ve spent many a happy afternoon over a chilled platter of briny Olde Salt and creamy Rochambeau oysters (meaty clams, too). The good news: that doesn t have to change thanks to the Wharf location s to go offerings, which even include chilled wines. Bivalves can be ordered shucked and ready, or whole to pop open at home. We re also fans of the crabcake, chowder, and peel and eat shrimp. Order online for pickup. Rasika palaak chaat 633 D St. , NW 1190 New Hampshire Ave. , NW Indian food is one of those cuisines that travels reliably well, and while chef Vikram Sunderam s crispy spinach may not hold up as well as a curry, we ve found it still fares well (credit the cooling yogurt, dates, and chutney each packaged separately). You can also buy homemade Rasika simmer sauces for cooking at home. Available for pickup or delivery. Red Hen rigatoni with sausage ragu 1822 First St. , NW This comforting bowl of pasta with a saucy Sunday style gravy packed with homemade fennel sausage and capped with parm has been on chef Michael Friedman s menu since day one. There s a reason it s never left. Order online for pickup or delivery. Rose s Luxury Pork and lychee salad 717 Eighth St. , SE Chef Aaron Silverman s unexpectedly addictive salad of sweet lychees, chilies, onion, pork, and coconut milk is a dish that helped land Rose s Luxury on the national map. You can now get it along with buzzed about entrees like grilled pork ribs as part of a three course takeout spread ( 45 per person). Order online for pickup. Sushi Taro chirashi 1503 17th St. , NW The Michelin starred Dupont restaurant never offered much takeout over its decades in business until the pandemic.

Old Blue River Trail,"City working on updated bike, pedestrian system plan Manhattan planners are envisioning a future with improved bicycle and pedestrian routes, including additional bikeways and protected cycletracks alongside city streets. City commissioners Tuesday discussed an update to the Bicycle and Pedestrian Systems Plan, which lays out potential future projects to improve biking and walking around Manhattan. The previous plan was adopted in 1998. City administration created the plan, with input from Kansas State University, USD 383, RCPD, the Chamber and area developers. Feedback was also sought from stakeholders such as Downtown Manhattan, Inc. and the Aggieville Business Association as well as the Rotary Club. Manhattan paid 40,000 to formulate the plan, leveraging a nearly 150,000 KDOT grant to assist as well. Funds for various projects will be sourced from the 2017 voter approved Parks and Recreation sales tax, the City University fund and an assortment of federal and state grants. In recent years, Manhattan has been able to leverage more than a million dollars from 270,000 of city investment for trail projects. The plan lists out a number of future projects to be tackled as funds permit over the next 10 to 20 years. Those include installing wayfinding signage on trails and expanding bicycle parking possibilities, finishing the final 6 miles of the Linear Trail loop, creating divided bicycle lanes and two way cycle tracks and filling in gaps in the sidewalk system. A full list can be found here. Projects will be prioritized using a matrix that accounts for equity, safety, connectivity, demand, need and financial feasibility. Based on these factors, projects are divided into four categories of prioritization: Do Now, Do If, Do When and Long Term. Commissioner Linda Morse suggested that priority be given to creating and improving trails in areas without connectivity to the trail system before improving walkways in already served neighborhoods. It s a benefit for the people in our community, says Morse. And some of the areas have never had the opportunity to have a bicycle and pedestrian path. Mayor Pro Tempore Wynn Butler says he s not a fan of separated bike boulevards, though questioned whether the city could make some streets one way in order to accommodate more bike lanes. He says there were multiple one way streets around town when he first arrived in the community in the 80s. If we re truly concerned about safety and we want people to use bike lanes and trails , I d like to have some people just take a look at that and see if it makes any sense. Another specific project discussed Tuesday is a plan to pave and add lighting along the newly created Old Blue River Trail that connects Northview to Downtown and the Linear Trail system. Public Works Director Rob Ott says this project is unique and that they don t plan to light every trail. Lighting will be handled by Evergy, for which the city will pay a small fee of about 12 per light. Mayor Usha Reddi says she is glad that is a part of the discussion. It s a big safety issue, says Reddi. Hopefully it s not going to be so bright that it impedes on some of the neighborhoods and their windows and their houses, but it s enough that you feel safe and you re not riding your bike or walking in the dark. The decision to pave the trail, administration says, is to increase its usability, especially after heavy rain when the walkway is turned to mud. City administration also says they ve heard comments on how dark the pathway is, and as there aren t neighboring homes they are in favor of adding lighting. Currently, City administration is anticipating that project to cost 250,000, but hope to significantly reduce the impact on the city by drawing in grant money. RCPD Update Riley County Police are testing new uniforms with an option available for officers to wear a ballistic vest, which the department s director says is not just an aesthetic choice. Director Dennis Butler provided an update to the Manhattan City Commission Tuesday and says the vests can help better distribute the weight of necessary gear and help reduce hip pain and discomfort caused by a heavy belt. He told commissioners a story of an officer he worked with in the past who was too small to fit all required gear on her belt. We evaluated it there and decided to go ahead and authorize our officers there to wear them, mainly for practical reasons, says Butler. Flexibility, not because it looked cool. Butler says he never was a big fan of the look of such vests, and expressed a desire to avoid looking too militaristic. He says whatever route they choose to go uniform wise, he wants any ballistic vests to blend well with the standard uniform. Now it s hard, in some ways, to get away from that perception from some people, Butler says. But that is part of my evaluation if they do recommend an outer vest as part of the uniform. RCPD is currently field testing a different shade of blue alongside a navy and a grey uniform over a 90 day period. The change in uniform comes after repeated complaints that the outfit is uncomfortable in certain scenarios and as many police departments move away from the French Blue color traditionally donned by Riley County officers. Butler also says that due to that decreased demand, acquiring uniforms in that color will be increasingly difficult as manufacturers remove it from production. Additionally, Butler told commissioners that RCPD has begun the first of a million dollars worth of upgrades as Riley County plans its roll out of a new emergency services radio system. Butler says that price tag is necessary to re outfit all officers and vehicles with necessary radios, microphones and holders to be able to utilize the new system. Butler says there are hopes the system will go live this summer. Live doesn t mean we ll be switched over and operating on it, he says. Live means then they ll start testing the system to make sure everything is operational. Butler also gave an update on the new RCPD firing range, saying work continues steadily. They are working with the county and vendor to get the facility in order as the lease on their current range ends at the end of June. We re hoping to at least have the basic, qualifactioned, firing line in place sometime before the end of the summer. If work takes longer than anticipated, Butler says they have contingency plans in place as well to ensure they aren t without a training facility.

Claflin Rd,"City commission selects Wynn Butler as new mayor; discusses 17th St. name change New Manhattan mayor City commissioner Wynn Butler has officially been named Manhattan s mayor for 2021. The change was made Tuesday as part of an annual reorganization which involves a rotation among the city commission s five members. Butler says he wants the commission to focus on taxes, infrastructure and responsible growth during his term. I don t want to see property taxes go up, Butler said. I don t want to see sales taxes go up either. We ve got to continue with infrastructure. Of course the airport we ve got a runway issue. We ve got a maintenance shop we need to finish. We ve got a levee we need to fix. We need to do that staying within our budget. Former mayor and now commissioner Usha Reddi closed out her term by highlighting accomplishments from 2020, such as beginning construction on the Aggieville parking garage and the Douglass Rec Center, and reflecting on the pandemic. This impacted every governing agency, staff member, business, public education and family, Reddi said. We had to make tough decisions regarding our budget and even tougher decisions regarding public health. I am proud of our community. These are challenging times and the Manhattan family stayed strong and continued to work together. In addition to Butler becoming mayor, commissioner Linda Morse was named mayor pro tem. Potential name change for 17th St. The name of 17th St. may officially change to Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. in the near future. With the submission of a request by MLK Memorial Committee, the city commission will soon consider an ordinance to officially enact the change. Kevin Bryant, MLK Memorial Committee co chair, explained to the commission during their meeting Tuesday why 17th St. was chosen. 17th Street symbolism is the bridge, Bryant said. In the past, Yuma Street east and west acted as a chasm to people of various backgrounds. Renaming a north and south street in honor of Dr. King would act as a bridge to the local community instead of emphasizing historic divisions. He says the street also symbolically connects many important parts of the area. The connection of 17th Street symbolically connects our military, our historical local business sector on Poyntz (Avenue) and the commitment to education at Kansas State University, Bryant said. Butler says that while he was concerned area residents would not want to change their addresses, he is relieved to hear that a survey carried out by the MLK Memorial Committee shows a majority of residents living on 17th St. support the change. That would have been my only concern if we had a large amount of residents or property owners that do not wish to go through the logistics of changing that, then I would begin not to support it, Butler said. But otherwise, I don t have a problem. While other commissioners, such as Mark Hatesohl, shared the same concern, support for the change was largely unanimous. Through a letter of support, K State also endorsed the change. Commissioner Aaron Estabrook says the project presents an opportunity to do the right thing. When I left to come to this meeting, my 10 year old daughter stopped me and said, hey, don t forget the time is always right to do what is right,' Estabrook said. That s a Dr. King quote. I think it s important to have that sign, that naming, so we can think about these things in our community. The commission previously discussed the name change in 2006, but decided instead to memorialize the street in MLK s honor. This was done so that residents would not have to officially change their addresses. 17th St. runs from Fort Riley Blvd. , through parts of Manhattan and the K State campus and ends at Claflin Rd. City officials say the process of getting the ordinance ready, informing residents of the upcoming change, obtaining materials and putting together an installation plan could take 60 to 90 days.

He says the street also symbolically connects many important parts of the area. The connection of 17th Street symbolically connects our military, our historical local business sector on Poyntz (Avenue) and the commitment to education at Kansas State University, Bryant said. Butler says that while he was concerned area residents would not want to change their addresses, he is relieved to hear that a survey carried out by the MLK Memorial Committee shows a majority of residents living on 17th St. support the change. That would have been my only concern if we had a large amount of residents or property owners that do not wish to go through the logistics of changing that, then I would begin not to support it, Butler said. But otherwise, I don t have a problem. While other commissioners, such as Mark Hatesohl, shared the same concern, support for the change was largely unanimous. Through a letter of support, K State also endorsed the change. Commissioner Aaron Estabrook says the project presents an opportunity to do the right thing. When I left to come to this meeting, my 10 year old daughter stopped me and said, hey, don t forget the time is always right to do what is right,' Estabrook said. That s a Dr. King quote. I think it s important to have that sign, that naming, so we can think about these things in our community. The commission previously discussed the name change in 2006, but decided instead to memorialize the street in MLK s honor. This was done so that residents would not have to officially change their addresses. 17th St. runs from Fort Riley Blvd. , through parts of Manhattan and the K State campus and ends at Claflin Rd. City officials say the process of getting the ordinance ready, informing residents of the upcoming change, obtaining materials and putting together an installation plan could take 60 to 90 days.

Ogden Avenue,"Recreational Cannabis: Supply Shortage Happened as Expected, Experts Say On its seventh day, the Illinois recreational cannabis industry was marked with short supplies, long lines, and in some cases, shuttered dispensaries Tuesday. And no one in the industry was surprised. Day one and week one are not perfect, Pharmacann s Jeremy Unruh said. But they are going as we anticipated. For months, just about everyone in the cannabis industry warned that supplies would most likely dwindle to zero after recreational marijuana launched on Jan. 1. As expected, some dispensaries closed completely this week, while others imposed purchase limits, or sold only to medical patients (State law mandates that medical cannabis users get first priority). We have limited supplies left, said Jason Erkes, spokesman for Cresco Labs. We re certainly out of some products and some strains, but we put rations in place at the beginning when things launched to make sure we could stretch our products as far as we can to make sure we serve as many recreational customers as we can. At Cresco s Sunnyside dispensary in Wrigleyville Tuesday, customers waited as long as four hours in line to get a chance at whatever they could buy. Queing up in a vacant bank a block away, patrons were warned about the purchase limits of one item per category (flowers, concentrates, and edibles). Gavin Fox told NBC 5 he waited about four hours in line. I tried on the second day, he said. But the line was far too extensive. it wasn t worth the wait. The state s largest dispensary, The Herbal Center on Ogden Avenue, shut down recreational sales completely over the weekend, giving preference to their medical customers. We will resume with sales of edibles, topicals, etc. on Friday, spokesman Courtney Greve Hack told NBC 5. No flower sale date set until they can feel confident they have enough for medical patients. Cresco and Pharmacann both raise cannabis, in addition to selling it. But Pharmacann s Unruh says that does not give companies like his a leg up, because state laws say they can t favor their own dispensaries. That s a regulatory requirement that we take very seriously, he told NBC 5. Over the last five years we have developed very strong wholesale relationships with the other cultivators in Illinois, and we ve spent the last several months leveraging and working those wholesale relationships to make sure that we re prepared for day one, week one, month one. For now, expect the shortages to continue possibly for weeks or even months as demand continues to run high. Right now, all the cultivators in the state are ramping up their production and expanding their facilities so there will be deliveries that come in on a regular basis for the next couple of months, Erkes said. But spring is really when we ll see all that product come to market.  Senior Apartment Complex Planned For Hinsdale Politics Government Senior Apartment Complex Planned For Hinsdale Development would be the largest real estate project considered in more than a decade, village official says. Reply (1) David Erickson, a vice president of Ryan Companies, and other representatives of the firm attend the meeting of the Hinsdale Village Board on Tuesday night. They proposed a 262 unit senior housing complex in Hinsdale. (David Giuliani/Patch) HINSDALE A developer is planning a 262 unit apartment complex for senior citizens, which one Hinsdale official called the largest real estate project that the village has considered in more than a decade. It will meet an increasing need for such housing in the area, the developer said. The plan for the development was outlined at Tuesday's Village Board meeting. The complex, called Clarendale of Hinsdale, would be at the northwest corner of Ogden Avenue and Adams Street and just east of the Route 83 interchange. It will be on the site of the Institute in Basic Life Principles, which is described as a non denominational Christian organization. That building would be torn down. The developer is Minneapolis based Ryan Companies. It has built Clarendale complexes in three other Chicago suburbs Addison, Algonquin and Mokena. Over the last five years, the company said it has invested more than 900 million in senior living developments. The local investment is estimated at 95 million the complex is expected to hire a full time workforce of slightly more than 100. The project would cover nearly 17 acres in Hinsdale and an additional 6 acres in neighboring Oak Brook. Representatives of the company said they approached Hinsdale first because the village's portion is the driving force of the project. They said the company has not formally approached Oak Brook. ""We believe this location will have a competitive advantage,"" said Dave Erickson, a Naperville based vice president for Ryan Companies. ""Having a Hinsdale address is a good thing. "" The 262 unit complex would include 122 suites for independent living, 85 assisted living suites, 38 units for memory care and 17 independent villas. All would be rentals. The project would consist of 60 percent green space, according to the plan. More than 23,000 seniors live within 15 minutes' driving time of the proposed complex, Erickson said. Within that same radius, an overwhelming majority of the senior living units are occupied. Of the 1,275 units for independent living, for example, 97 percent are taken, according to the company. That's a high occupancy rate, which demonstrates significant demand in the market, Erickson said. One of the biggest challenges for the project is that nearly a quarter of the property is floodway or wetlands. The company must go through FEMA and DuPage County to get that remapped, which would involve moving dirt and paperwork, Erickson said. According to the plans, the buildings fronting Ogden Avenue would be two floors. Farther away from Ogden, the structures would rise to three stories, then four. That may become a significant issue, officials said, because building heights have been a hot topic before.  Ballots set for Wisconsin nonpartisan races The ballots are set for the nonpartisan spring election. On April 7, voters will decide who represents them in all 21 Douglas County Board districts. The odd numbered Superior City Council seats are on the ballot, as well. Statewide, voters will decide in February who moves on to the April election for a 10 year term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Justice Daniel Kelly, appointed by Gov. Scott Walker in 2016, faces challenges from Ed Fallone, a Marquette University Law School professor, and Dane County Circuit Court Judge Jill J. Karofsky. Only three Douglas County Board supervisors are facing a challenge this year all of whom represent rural districts. Incumbent Pat Ryan of County Road C is facing a challenge from John Lohse of East Burning Tree Drive to represent most of the town of Superior, and the villages of Superior and Oliver. ADVERTISEMENT Incumbent Susan Hendrickson, who represents a portion of the town of Superior and Parkland, is facing a challenge from Jon Allen of Lee Road. And incumbent Joseph Moen is facing a rematch against former supervisor Dan Corbin. Two years ago, Moen unseated Corbin as the representative for the town of Oakland and the northern portion of Summit. Joel Certa Werner of North 16th Street is the lone candidate to step forward to run for the seat held by former County Board Chairman Doug Finn for almost 40 years. In addition to supervisors representing the 13 districts in the city, County Board Chairman Mark Liebaert and Supervisors Scott Luostari, Steven Long, Jim Borgeson and Mary Lou Bergman are running unopposed. Three races set for City Council In Superior, three of the five seats on the ballot are contested, and two districts are headed for primary contests to narrow the field of candidates. In the 1st District, where Councilor Dan Olson is stepping down at the end of his sixth term, Kalee Hermanson of Central Avenue, Nicholas Ledin of Oakes Avenue and Brian DeMar of Ogden Avenue are vying to replace him. Only two will move on after the Feb. 18 primary to the April 7 election. Incumbent Brent Fennessey is facing two challengers for the 5th District seat on the Council. Amanda Foster of Norwood Avenue and Joshua Johnson of Belknap Street are running for a chance to serve the district that includes Central Park. Newcomer Kelly Schoen of Ogden Avenue is challenging 3rd District incumbent Warren Bender, who has served on the Council since 2008. ADVERTISEMENT Councilors Ruth Ludwig in the 7th District and Keith Kern in the 9th are running unopposed. Absentee voters will get two primary ballots With the nonpartisan primaries running in conjunction with the special primary for Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District, permanent absentee voters will receive two ballots, said Superior City Clerk Terri Kalan. There are two ballots for the February election, Kalan said. Ballot A includes only the contest for the 7th Congressional District as it is a federal election. Permanent absentee voters may have already received Ballot A, since ballots must be mailed 47 days prior to a federal election. Ballot B, which will be mailed by Jan. 28, will include the nonpartisan state and local races as well as the 7th Congressional District race. Voters who cast their ballots at the polls will only see Ballot B. Permanent absentee voters are encouraged to vote again in the congressional race even if they ve already voted using Ballot A. If both ballots are returned to our office, only Ballot B, containing all the contests, will be counted, Kalan said.  CHA gave $76M deal to movie studio head’s group while he was an FBI mole While secretly recording conversations to help the FBI expose an extortion scheme run by longtime Chicago Teamsters union boss John T. Coli Sr. , the president of Chicago s largest movie studio, Alexander S. Pissios, also had a starring role in another production that could bring him and his partners millions of dollars. Pissios Cinespace Chicago Film Studios teamed with public housing manager The Habitat Co. and Mount Sinai Hospital on a development in North Lawndale, getting the Chicago Housing Authority to approve their proposal for a 76 million development on Ogden Avenue including stores, offices and homes. Records show Pissios and his partners stand to share in more than 4 million in fees for developing nearly 11 acres that includes CHA land and also property that Cinespace and the not for profit hospital bought from City Hall during Mayor Rahm Emanuel s administration. Pissios and his partners put that plan together during the months long period he was secretly working with the U. S. attorney s office in Chicago to investigate Coli, hoping that would keep him and his wife from being charged with bankruptcy fraud. The Pissios group submitted its plan to the CHA on March 22, 2017. Nine days later, the U. S. attorney s office gave him a non prosecution deal, guaranteeing he would face no criminal charges, in exchange for helping them in the Coli investigation. It s unclear whether the authorities eavesdropped on any of Pissios conversations regarding the development project or were listening only to his conversations with Coli. CHA and Mount Sinai officials say they haven t been contacted by federal authorities regarding Pissios. Habitat executives won t talk about Pissios or their project. Pissios didn t return messages. Last month, a few days before Christmas, the Pissios group wrapped up a 21.78 million financing package for the initial phase of the CHA project, records show. This part of the housing authority development, which won t include any homes, will build new offices for Cinespace and Mount Sinai. Pissios has been a member of the hospital s board since 2013. The housing authority is helping finance the project, which is getting federal tax incentives and 2.5 million from City Hall s Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, money that Emanuel pledged before leaving office last year. That taxpayer funding is the latest in a string of government subsidies Pissios has gotten over the past decade despite his financial and legal problems. He got 27.3 million in state grants under Gov. Pat Quinn to help his uncle launch the West Side movie studio. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel helped Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, 2621 W. 15th Pl. , get a property tax cut worth as much as 3.4 million. He also gave the studio permission to close off and take over city streets to create a bigger Cinespace campus, forcing traffic, including CTA buses, to be rerouted. Tyler LaRiviere / Sun Times Later, Emanuel helped the studio get a property tax cut worth as much as 3.4 million. He also gave the studio permission to close off and take over city streets to create a bigger Cinespace campus, forcing traffic, including CTA buses, to be rerouted. The studio secured most of that government funding with help from Coli a powerful union supporter of Quinn and Emanuel who had been extorting money from Pissios during the time the studio boss was wearing a wire. Former longtime Chicago Teamsters union boss John T. Coli Sr. s guilty plea last summer to extorting 325,000 from Cinespace meant that Alexander Pissios wouldn t have to testify for the prosecution at his trial. Ashlee Rezin Garcia / Sun Times Coli pleaded guilty last summer to extorting 325,000 from Cinespace and agreed to cooperate with federal authorities. That means Pissios won t have to testify as the star prosecution witness at his trial. Pissios name also has surfaced in the ongoing federal investigation of the collapse of Washington Federal Bank for Savings, which was shut down in December 2017, days after bank president John Gembara was found hanged in the bedroom of a customer s home in Park Ridge. When Pissios filed for bankruptcy in 2011, he owed the clout heavy Bridgeport bank millions of dollars from real estate loans. It s unclear whether Pissios ever repaid those loans. Also unclear: how Pissios became a partner with Mount Sinai and with Habitat, which is headed by developer Daniel Levin, who, under a federal court order, had overseen the CHA s scattered site housing program for 23 years. Future site of Ogden Commons development at northwest corner of Ogden Avenue and South Talman Avenue. Apple maps Mount Sinai vice president James Bicak says the CHA encouraged the hospital to team with Habitat on the commercial and residential development, which is near the hospital. But hospital and CHA officials say they didn t know who exactly recommended the partnership. Emanuel has strong ties to Mount Sinai, where his late father, Dr. Benjamin Emanuel, did his medical residency. The hospital was founded in 1919 by a grandfather of Steven Koch, who was on the hospital s board for 24 years, the last seven of them as chairman. He resigned that post when he became Emanuel s deputy mayor in 2012. The former mayor says he has not been contacted by federal authorities regarding Pissios or Coli. The CHA s board, appointed by Emanuel, selected the Habitat, Cinespace and Mount Sinai team in June 2017 even though it gave the group a slightly lower score than it gave Brinshore Development, which also had bid for the work. CHA officials said they liked that Habitat was working with two major employers in the neighborhood Cinespace and Mount Sinai and that their proposal would encompass an extra 5.5 acres, including land they bought from the city. Among the CHA board members who approved the deal was John Hooker, who resigned as chairman last summer, as his lobbying work for ComEd had become part of a federal corruption investigation centering on Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, D Chicago. The construction site at Ogden Avenue and South Talman Avenue where the Ogden Commons development is planned. The Chicago Housing Authority had hoped the project would be finished by September 2020. But it s unclear when the development will be completed or even when construction will begin. Tyler LaRiviere / Sun Times The CHA board also included vice chairman Craig Chico, brother of former mayoral candidate Gery Chico. Gery Chico s law firm Chico Nunes is working for the Habitat, Cinespace and Mount Sinai partnership. CHA s legal department and ethics officer have determined that there was no conflict because vice chair Chico did not stand to derive any financial benefit, directly or indirectly, from the law firm s role as a retained party, according to CHA spokeswoman Molly Sullivan.  Naperville considering requirement to keep former city land on tax rolls Naperville considering requirement to keep former city land on tax rolls When Perma Seal bought a city owned property in Naperville in 2016, the plan was for the basement waterproofing company to move its headquarters there. Fast forward nearly four years, and plans have changed, city officials say. Perma Seal never built a headquarters at 1720 Quincy Ave. and now is trying to sell the 5 acre property, City Attorney Mike DiSanto said. He said Perma Seal has approached the city about challenges it is encountering in selling the property because of covenants the city placed on the site during the 2016 sale. The city sold the land in an industrial area off Ogden Avenue to Perma Seal for 770,000, which was about 81% of the land's 945,000 appraised valuation. The sale was contingent on Perma Seal carrying out the plan the company had proposed, DiSanto said, ""getting this (site) off the tax exempt rolls and onto a property tax generating owner. "" The council now plans to take a new action to ensure the land will continue to generate property taxes, even if or when Perma Seal sells it. The council is expected to review a resolution that will modify the covenants on the property to require any future owner to be a property tax generating entity, DiSanto said. Council members voted unanimously in support of the new requirements, with Patrick Kelly, an attorney, recusing himself because the property owner is a former client. Council member Paul Hinterlong said he would like a future owner to generate sales taxes as well. But Mayor Steve Chirico said that would be too exclusive, and it will not be required under the proposed modifications to the covenants. ""As a property owner, if you're trying to sell and you're limited to selling to somebody who only does retail sales in an industrial area, that would eliminate most buyers,"" Chirico said. ""So I think it would be very difficult for them to sell this property if we're going to put that restriction on them. "" Roy Spencer, Perma Seal's founder and president, did not return calls seeking comment.

North Clark Street,"Ringing in the new year with weed A daily marijuana user, she said she s glad to be able buy at a store instead of from a dealer. It makes things easier, said the 35 year old Forest Park resident, who spent 120 on some buds, joints and edibles. It s always in the back of your mind, you re going to get busted. Now it s less of a big deal. Ryan was among thousands who lined up outside marijuana shops in the city and suburbs to buy marijuana on the first day its sale became legal in Illinois, braving temperatures in the 20s while most people were still sleeping off New Year s revelry. Some are regular users like her who welcomed the chance to buy weed in a brightly lit store in the light of day. Others wanted to be part of history as Illinois became the 11th state to allow recreational sales of marijuana. I ve been waiting for this since the '70s, Jan Tranen, a writer who lives in Lakeview, said while waiting in a line that stretched around the corner from the tiny 900 square foot Sunnyside dispensary. Weed shops around the state opened at 6 a. m. to throngs of people. Cars packed the streets of a light industrial park in Mundelein, home to the state s busiest dispensary, Rise, owned by Green Thumb Industries. It s one of the few that s open in the northern suburbs. When CEO Ben Kovler arrived at 5:30 a. m. , there were more than 500 people lined up in the parking lot. Our first customer said he got here at 5 last night, Kovler said. It s a bigger crowd than we expected. The tidal wave (around recreational cannabis) is real. The crowd ranged from Kate, a 26 year old college student who, like many, said she was uncomfortable giving her last name because of the stigma that s still attached to marijuana use, to Nick, a man in his early 60s. Kate was waiting to buy edibles out of curiosity because she doesn t drink. Nick, who said he hadn t indulged in 16 years, bought some marijuana flower, pre rolled joints and edibles. Wendy, a 49 year old who asked not to reveal her last name, left home in Carpentersville at 4:45 a. m. , arriving in Mundelein at 5:30. She got in the door at 8:15 to buy a little flower. I ve been smoking for 28 years, she said. This is the first day it s legal. I wanted to be part of history. The first sale in the state was recorded at Dispensary 33 on North Clark Street in Uptown. Cresco said it sold more than 9,000 cannabis items to about 3,400 customers at its five shops around the state. The average ring was 135, which included taxes. Crowds were festive and in good spirits, despite waits. ""The weather is cooperating,"" said Paul Stewart, an adviser to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot who is the city's point person on marijuana. Politicians and weed industry veterans savored the moment. ""It's pretty cool,"" said John Sullivan, executive vice president for public affairs at Cresco. He opened what is now the Sunnyside dispensary in Lakeview five years ago under the MedMar name. ""We went through a lot to get this place open. We were sued. When you think about how far the state has come, it's amazing. "" State Reps. Kelly Cassidy of Chicago and Jehan Gordon Booth of Peoria, who were among the co sponsors of the bill that passed on the last day of the General Assembly's regularly scheduled session in May, celebrated outside Dispensary 33. ""We did get overwhelmed walking up here, seeing the line of people,"" Cassidy said. ""This is what it's supposed to be. "" Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton made one of the first purchases at Cresco, buying some Mindy s glazed clementine edibles. She celebrated the 11,000 pardons issued New Year's Eve by Gov. J. B. Pritzker, the first of many expected for people previously convicted of minor marijuana possession. Putting an end to what many activists and politicians see as a failed war on drugs was key to getting the law passed. For Gordon Booth, the issue is personal: ""My stepson, D. J. , lost his life five years ago over cannabis. We don't talk about the fact that people lost their lives over this product. "" Privately, many dispensary operators wonder how long the goodwill and availability of marijuana, especially the buds or ""flower,"" which are in high demand and short supply will last. Many dispensaries were limiting the amount of product people could buy. We did institute a purchase limit of 300 per customer to help manage inventory, and we did not run out of any product classes, but did run out of some specific popular products and strains, said Kris Krane, president of 4Front, which operates the Mission dispensary in the South Shore neighborhood. Cresco said it also ran out of some individual products at Sunnyside in Lakeview but still had products in every category. Windy City Cannabis tweeted that it cut off lines at its four suburban locations at 2:45 p. m. due to wait times and inventory. Illinois launched recreational sales just six months after Pritzker signed the law making Illinois the 11th state to allow weed sales to the public. It takes six months to build new cultivation facilities and three months to grow marijuana, so the industry was fighting an uphill battle against the calendar from the beginning. Dispensaries have been scrambling to get enough product, which can only be obtained from growers in the state. Mark de Souza, CEO of Revolution Global, which operates a medical dispensary in Mount Prospect and a cultivation center in downstate Delavan. The company sells to other dispensaries, making inventory available on Tuesday mornings. ""We were sold out in six minutes,"" said de Souza. ""It used to take hours. "" Illinois hopes to generate more than a half billion dollars annually from marijuana sales that are predicted to hit 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion a year when the market is fully grown. But it s not clear when that will happen. Marijuana, especially flower, or the dried plant that s most often smoked, will be in short supply until mid year if not all of 2020, growers say.  Illinois dispensaries open for recreational sales: Leafly’s live coverage IndustryPolitics Illinois dispensaries open for recreational sales: Leafly s live coverage Leafly Staff January 1, 2020 Edie Moore (right), executive director of Chicago NORML makes the first purchase on the first day of recreational cannabis sales in Illinois at Mission dispensary in Chicago, Illinois, Jan. 1, 2020. (Taylor Glascock/for Leafly) Legalization comes to the Land of Lincoln on New Year s Day, and Leafly is on the ground with coverage from cannabis dispensaries across Illinois. Check back throughout the day as we continue to bring you highlights from around the state. Illinois legalization launch clears liftoff, heads to orbit 2:00 p. m. , Chicago They came before dawn. Their extremities went numb. Yet they smiled and cheered, and then they got high. Launch day for Illinois legalization is well underway this afternoon, with tens of thousands of people likely to cycle through several dozen stores across the state. Meanwhile, on TV, the world watched and rooted them on. Waits ran four plus hours at the MOCA dispensary near Logan Square in Chicago at midday, and recreational supplies of flowers were already running low, staffers told the crowd. Still, none gave up their place in line. Rather, the sunny 40 degree weather and all the news reports only served to grow the throngs such was the draw of hype and history across the Land of Lincoln today. The days and weeks to come promise more lines, along with extensive recreational product shortages but those are mere growing pains. Every attendee that Leafly talked to today agreed that what began before dawn in Illinois promises to reverberate across the Midwest, South, and East of the US fomenting even bigger changes. I love this shit so much, said one man in a three hour line at Dispensary 33. This is great. Two latecomers, Patrick a 47 year old project manager and his partner Yolanda in her 40s and in finance noted the launch day was like the Popeye s Chicken sandwich rollout of 2019. Of course there is scarcity. And almost everyone could agree with Patrick, who said, I m kind of mad I didn t get up earlier. Thanks for reading along with Leafly s liveblog of the day s events. Keep reading below for all the quotes, photos, and color of the day. And stay tuned to Leafly for where legalization goes from here. David Downs 3 hour wait for legal herb? We don t mind 12:39 p. m. , Chicago Diontae, 35, and Monika 32, are both from the South Side of Chicago. Both saw the morning news coverage of opening day sales at Illinois cannabis stores, jumped in their car together, and drove down to Sunnyside near Wrigleyville to get into the back of what is now a three hour line to buy legal cannabis. It s also 21 degrees out in the sun. They didn t show the line on the news, said Diontae. This is crazy all these people openly standing in line to buy drugs, he said. We don t do lines. But this is one line we don t mind waiting in. It s so mind blowing, he said. We re from the South Side, so we re impacted by the war on drugs. Diontae had a cannabis conviction that he got expunged on his own. He expects to spend 120 to 140 on cannabis flower. We ll try edibles later. On their last trip to Las Vegas, the duo failed to make it to a legal store and promised themselves they d return to hit one up. Now they don t have to schlep to Vegas. You don t have to go to Cali or Michigan. David Downs I m thrilled to have these dispensaries 12:33 p. m. , Chicago Dispensary 33 in Chicago hosted a 10 a. m. press conference featuring several city and officials, including the Chicago Deputy Mayor Samir Mayekar, several alderman, and a number of state representatives. Dispensary 33 had served 350 people in just a few hours, with hundreds more still waiting to be served. Legalization bill sponsor State Rep. Kelly Cassidy stopped by the store and said this is surreal, referring to the hundreds waiting patiently down the block. 'This is the beginning of the end of the war on drugs. ' Cassidy said she looks forward to implementing equity licensing and automatic expungements. This isn t the finish line. This is the beginning of the end of the war on drugs. While many Illinois cities have rejected legal sales, some Chicago wards are welcoming them. Fortieth ward Alderman Andre Vasquez said friends have been arrested and some have died in the war on cannabis. It really does warm my heart on this very cold day, he said. Yeah, i m just geeked. Forty seventh ward Alderman Matt Martin celebrated Dispensary 33 s local ownership. We need to live our values, he said. This proves change is possible. I m thrilled to have these dispensaries in my ward. David Downs Licenses kill the illegal market but if you don t give out the licenses, people can t buy legally and the illegal market thrives. We ve seen this in many states. California s transition from illegal to legal is moving at a glacial pace because too many local towns and counties prohibit legal stores. Illinois is just waking up to the issue. I should ve figured the state of Illinois would fuck this up. Weed is recreationally legal today, but all the dispensaries around me haven t been approved by the state to sell recreationally. Dude wtf JBPritzker Pay College Athletes ( GeniusWithNoJob) January 1, 2020 Lines still forming at stores around Chicagoland 11:06 a. m. , Chicago As the morning approaches the noon hour, more New Year revelers are waking up and taking their place at the end of the still growing lines at legal cannabis stores around Illinois. Leafly s David Downs shot this video at Dispensary 33 on North Clark Street a few minutes ago: Donuts, hot dogs, and propane heaters in Homewood 10:41 a. m. , Homewood Windy City Cannabis in Homewood, IL, which is just ten miles from the Indiana state line, did it right for their customers: Outside heaters, donuts, and hot dogs for those in line. Richard, who was standing right under one of the heaters, was hoping to obtain some Blue Gelato and Durban Poison. A sativa fan, he was fifth in line and had been there since 8 a. m. Doors were scheduled to open at 11 a. m. He didn t have a medical cannabis card, Richard said. He came here from Oak Lawn because that city passed an ordinance banning adult use cannabis stores. That was a mistake, he said. I think they ll realize that soon. Another gentleman standing next to Richard well disguised, I might add, with sunglasses and enough bundling to never be recognized as well as keep the cold out did not wish to give his name, and he said he almost went to Joliet this morning because there were two open shops there, which could mean shorter lines. But I think I came to the right place. Brandon Weber Lt. Gov. Stratton marks history: A model for the entire country 10:12 a. m. , Chicago Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton was on hand Wednesday morning to buy cannabis at Sunnyside in Chicago s Lakeview neighborhood. We believe the social equity aspects of this legislation should be a model for the entire country, she said outside the store. Yesterday, Governor Pritzker pardoned 11,017 low level cannabis arrests and convictions. That s just the beginning. We have hundreds of thousands more who will be eligible for having their records expunged. That s a big deal. Better than waiting for the new iPhone Weed is now legal in Illinois. It feels like 15f outside. 500 people deep at 9am. Worse than a damn console release. Wow. pic. twitter. com/nuNnU1hZ06 Jesse ( ItsGime) January 1, 2020 The stigma is real for many Illinois consumers 10:07 a. m. , Chicago They pulled hoodies down over their faces and turned away from the news cameras. They declined to give their name, or used a fake. And they are many. Even though cannabis is now legal in Illinois, the stigma remains. You can lose your job, education, housing, kids, pain medication, or more over cannabis. Locals are savvy the consequences of being outed as a cannabis consumer. Thirty year old Noire declined to give her real name and confirmed, the stigma is real. All of these people are in jail on marijuana charges, she added. Illinois State Police made more than 34,000 cannabis arrests in 2016. Noire lined up around dawn to get edibles and be a part of the big day. It s historic. We are one of the only liberal states in the midwest. Others in line noted the diverse ages and ethnicities of the crowd. So this is who smokes weed, said one customer. People from all walks of life. David Downs It feels good to be a part of history 9:55 a. m. , Chicago Mohammed, 26, and Amir, 24, both of Chicago spent 90 each on Starkiller and Durban Poison. It feels good to be a part of history, said Mohammed. It ll show people cannabis use is no big deal. Mohammend hopes to visit every open cannabis store and catch em all like Pokemon. And both men look forward to prices coming down. We re not a big fan of the prices. As we were talking, a passerby eyed the line and said, My guy is faster than this. David Downs Romeoville represents in the 23 degree cold 9:50 a. m. , Romeoville At VeriLife s store here in Romeoville, Dylan arrived from his home in Naperville about 3:30 a. m. , and found himself first in line. Dylan sported a Chicago Blackhawks cap and as much warm weather gear as he could find. The only thing he was missing? Some good boots. His fiancee and he tag teamed to keep their spot in line, each taking time to warm up in their nearby vehicle especially his feet. As we were talking, a young man strolled past to find the end of the line, blocks away. He was dressed in sandals and warm socks. When asked what he wanted to find inside the store at the 9:00 am start time, Dylan said, I want a cartridge, and possibly a gram. As I moved down the line, somebody shouted, Hey, Dylan REPRESENT! Another waiting customer, Rich, wasn t even sure what he wanted to find. I ve been here since seven o clock, he said. I m just looking for something to help me sleep, and something to make me giggle. He didn t seem too upset about being in line. January first, everybody else is home with a hangover. Near the end of the line which was still adding people by the minute Gina and Lauren were pretty sure they wanted to get some high quality flower. They didn t seem to mind the line, or the 23 degree cold. It s not windy. It s really not that bad out. The sun came out, so that helps. Pro tip: An Illinois patrol car passed me by as I drove to a parking spot in this heavily industrial area, blocks past the end of the line. He flagged me. Just so you know, we re not patrolling the private parking lots. I didn t say that officially he added with a smile. Brandon Weber Sorry, military spouses must step off base to puff 9:30 a. m. , Chicago Scott Air Force Base News brings us information about cannabis use for those connected to the military: Marijuana may be legal in Illinois, but what about Scott Air Force Base? Though affiliated with military, be it active duty, Reserves, or National Guard, military spouses are still treated as civilians in the eyes of the law and the military. So, if something is legal in your state, then military spouses are treated the same as any other civilian. But that does not include cannabis use on government property as these are still federally controlled substances. Government property includes on base or in any military housing, on base or off. Also, be aware that even if you can use cannabis, your service member cannot. If you leave cannabis in a vehicle that your service member drives onto base, he or she has technically introduced an illegal substance onto a military installation. The use or possession of an illegal substance could end a service member s career. David Downs Illinois State Police: Use common sense, don t smoke and drive 9:15 a. m. , Chicago Illinois State Police chief Brandon Kelly discussed fears of DUI increases after legalization in a radio interview. There s differing opinions about what the data say, he said. For example, lots of folks look to Colorado as the test subject for this policy. Just for the record, in Colorado, traffic fatalities fell in 2019 to 533, down 55 from the prior year off a 2002 peak of 677. Colorado s also maybe not the best barometer, though they have very loose traffic safety laws you can t be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt. In the end it comes down to common sense, said Kelly. Not a lot will change on Jan.1 in terms of enforcement you can t be driving aorund in your vehicle high on cannabis, that s not safe, just as it s not safe to drive under the influence of alcohol, or heroin, or fentanyl. In Washington, the data continues to implicate alcohol as the problem driver in that legalization state. Here s Washington s snapshot of fatal accidents. It s flat. Still, two thirds of Illinois drivers in a AAA survey said they were very concerned about cannabis on the roadways. David Downs New day dawns at O Hare Airport as weed walks free 9:08 a. m. , Chicago Don t fly with cannabis. You don t have the nerve to be a smuggler like Han Solo. But if you accidentally do fly with cannabis out of Illinois, take heart. State police have to enforce state law. Personal amounts of cannabis cannot be seized. According to NBC: If it s not a violation, we would offer them proper disposal, if they wish, or they could continue on with their travels, Mullane said, adding that CPD cannot require someone to dispose of it if it is legal. We would explain to them that under federal law, it is still a violation and that based on where they are going to it may be a violation there, he added. No different if they are flying into Chicago with product. If they are legal, they are legal. But still, don t do it. The mayor s office also warned that federal law prohibits cannabis possession in any amount, which could affect travelers. Transportation of any amount of cannabis remains illegal across state lines, and possession of cannabis may be illegal in the state or country to which you are traveling, said a statement from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot s office. David Downs South Side Chicago cannabis sales start at Mission Illinois 8:31 a. m. , Chicago Edie Moore, executive director of Chicago NORML and a key champion of legalization, became the first person to buy legal cannabis in Chicago s famous South Side at 6 a. m. Wednesday. Moore was the guest of honor at Mission Illinois, the only South Side dispensary approved for adult use sales on launch day. It feels amazing to be the first purchaser, Moore told Leafly. It s a historic moment for South Side residents, she said. It means they have a place to actually come Mission is a really great facility and it s clean and it s friendly and they don t have to travel all the way to the north side that s great. Moore spent 70 on an eighth ounce of White Harmony. Lines are long and getting longer at Mission Illinois, as more folks see the news on morning TV and rush down. Additionally, Moore reported that the state purchase system went down briefly, creating additional delays. David Downs Kris Krane, founder of Mission Illinois and an industry veteran, said lines were running about three hours and more people were showing up to the only dispensary open on the South Side. It s an honor to represent legalization on the South Side, Krane said. This community has been hit hardest by cannabis prohibition, so it is heartwarming to be able to provide a professional environment where residents can legally purchase cannabis without fear of arrest or stigma of being branded a criminal. We look forward to being a productive member of the community for years to come. Springfield turns out early for opening day Hey, don t know if you heard, but weed is legal in Illinois. We are almost 2 hours in, and the line is still stretching around the block for Illinois Supply and Provisions in Springfield. People have been in line since 1 PM YESTERDAY pic. twitter. com/bIct7zgrpm Cole Henke ( cole Henke) January 1, 2020 Equity license applicant early in line 6:56 a. m. , Chicago One of the early customers at Chicago s Sunnyside cannabis store was Elise Swopes, age 30, from the Wrigleyville area. A medical cannabis patient since summer, she s helping her cousin Aaron apply for an equity license to sell cannabis. We re excited to be a part of it, she said. She said she s extremely hopeful for her cousin, Aaron, who gets bonus points on his application for having a cannabis conviction. The latest data available show that Illinois police made over 34,000 cannabis arrests in 2016, the majority of them for simple possession. David Downs Surreal in the best possible way Local reacted on social media to the state s first morning of legal sales. Today I am going to get into my car, drive 2 minutes down the road, enter a store, and purchase legal weed. This is so surreal, in the best possible way But don t think I won t get loud as hell if we don t see license priority for POC this year, Illinois. stephanie lynn ( stephanieIynnnn) January 1, 2020 Its 2020 and this part of Illinois doesn t smell like weed. Guess that argument of if you make it legal, everyone will do it didn t pan out, huh? LILWOOLEY ( theLILWOOLEY) January 1, 2020 After seeing the prices of Illinois weed they can go ahead and make that shit illegal again, at least it was affordable before Stevie Rich ( rich stevie) January 1, 2020 We got weed! in Joliet 6:37 a. m. , Joliet Just prior to opening at 6:00 a. m. , the atmosphere at Rise in Joliet was jovial despite the frigid 20 degree temperatures. The first person in line, Casey, had been there since 1:30 a. m. We wanted to wait inside our cars, where we had heat, but two other cars pulled in and we saw people getting out. So we beat them to the door! As the clock showed 5:59:50, the crowd began counting down. 5 4 3 2 1 YEEESSSSS! Casey was beaming as he completed his purchase. One item he was really pleased with? Got a pre roll White 99! The staff at Rise also gave him a free grinder for being there on opening day. Rise boasts that the family of its founder, Ben Kovler, played a part in the first prohibition: Rise s founder, Ben Kovler, comes from a legacy of post prohibition pioneers. His great grandfather, Harry Blum, invested in Jim Beam back in the early 30 s and transformed it into one of America s most iconic brands. Some of the folks in line were reluctant to be photographed. You don t want your boss to know? one person asked. I don t want my MOM to know! another answered. My work thinks I m in Chicago! As another happy customer headed out the door, he shouted as he held up his bag, WE GOT WEED! The crowd cheered in response. Brandon Weber Cannabis history made before dawn in Chicago 6:25 a. m. , Chicago Who says cannabis consumers aren t productive? While most of America snored through their New Year s Day hangover Illinois cannabis fans donned skiwear and braved sub freezing temperatures to smoke a piece of state history before dawn. Thirty five year old Forest Park resident Jackie Ryan took the sleep aid melatonin and went to bed at 7 p. m. on New Year s Eve to get up at 1 a. m. on New Year s Day and become the first in line to purchase legal cannabis in Illinois state history this morning. At 6 a. m central standard time, Ryan bought a pre roll, an edible, and an eighth ounce of Durban Poison for 120 as the crowd whooped and an international video feed broadcasted the images by satellite worldwide. Hundreds more customers waited outside. Ryan said she did it to be a part of history. I really didn t think I d ever see this day in Illinois. She said she knows people who ve gotten into major trouble with cannabis, including one friend who was imprisoned in Texas. She said legalization will absolutely change the conversation in the midwest. Video of first sale. pic. twitter. com/47PhuisqrQ David Downs ( davidrdowns) January 1, 2020 More than 100 people many still smelling of alcohol, or intoxicated from New Year s Eve revelry stamped their feet and tried to keep their hands warm in 21 degree darkness. Aaron Schneider, 24, from Boystown said he was standing 3rd in line in the cold outside for Weed! Schneider said he didn t vote for Gov. J. B. Pritzker, but he got the job done with regard to cannabis. Schneider got in line at 1:30 a. m. , part of a plan to spend the evening making history. The first time Schneider smoked weed he was 16, it was the 4th of July, it was great. He said Illinois legalization was inevitable after Colorado started in 2012. Cancer patient among first in line for rec sales 5:15 a. m. , Chicago Outside the Sunnyside cannabis store in Chicago s Wrigleyville neighborhood, one of the first guys in line in the cold was Dustin Kennedy, age 30, from the neighborhood. When his wife started getting sleepy after midnight, he excused himself to get in line. He forgot his ID though, meaning he could not buy anything. So his wife got up, came over, and dropped it off. Don t call me again, she said. The first time Kennedy had smoked was age 18, out of a soda can. He said he knew people busted for cannabis and it fucked their life up. Kennedy planned on spending 200 max, with his wife s permission on edibles and transdermal patches. He can t smoke. Kennedy is currently in treatment for lung cancer, and cannabis helps a lot with the itching and insomnia caused by his cancer medication. Kennedy said he knew legalization would come to Illinois eventually. I m excited to see the tax revenue. They need the money for sure.

Pritzker clears 11,000 cannabis convictions CHICAGO (AP) Illinois governor granted more than 11,000 pardons for low level marijuana convictions on Tuesday, describing the step as a first wave of thousands of such expungements anticipated under the state s new marijuana legalization law. The expungement process is a key part of the law, which takes effect Wednesday and made Illinois the 11th state to legalize marijuana for people 21 or older. When they crafted the policy, Illinois lawmakers said they wanted to repair some of the damage caused by law enforcement s efforts to combat sale and use of the drug, particularly in minority communities. Tomorrow, Illinois will become the 11th state to legalize and regulate adult use cannabis. But our state is today doing something that sets us apart: Illinois is putting equity first, clearing thousands of convictions and giving individuals their families a new lease on life. pic. twitter. com/IgoOJCAlZj Governor JB Pritzker ( GovPritzker) December 31, 2019 Pritzker announced the pardons at a church on Chicago s South Side. He said clearing the misdemeanor offenses from individuals records will make it easier for them to get jobs, housing and financial aid for college. State officials estimate that 116,000 convictions involving 30 grams or less of marijuana, including for possession of the drug, are eligible for pardons under the new law. Illinois State Police are responsible for identifying those convictions and sending the records to the state s Prisoner Review Board, which then forwarded eligible cases to the governor s office for pardons. Everybody s getting ready This will no doubt be the single largest gathering of my high school s graduating class since 2004 pic. twitter. com/xn1WW8Qdda Parker Molloy ( ParkerMolloy) January 1, 2020 Too high? Here s how to help Somebody s gonna overdo it and get too high. It happens on every opening day. With edibles, remember: Start low, go slow. If you haven t tried an edible before, try a low dose like 5mg or 10 mg, give it at least an hour to fully kick in, and enjoy the ride. If you find yourself or a friend kinda out there, Leafly has a couple great resources. The main thing to remember: Stay calm and breathe. This too shall pass. Nobody has ever died from consuming too much cannabis. Pro tip: Don t take it out of state You think those Indiana state troopers are sleeping late on New Year s Day? Think again. Prohibition states often like to make a statement by mounting emphasis patrols near the borders of legal states. In 2016, a federal court ordered Kansas state troopers to stop the practice of pulling over cars with Colorado plates just because they suspected their drivers of possessing cannabis. If history repeats, there will be plenty of state police cars prowling the east west highways near the Illinois border this week. Here s the risk you run in those border states for a first offense. (Information courtesy of our friends at NORML. ) Indiana: Possession of up to 1 ounce 180 days in jail, 1,000 fine Kentucky: Possession of up to 8 ounces 45 days in jail, 250 fine Missouri: Possession of up to 10 grams 500 fine Iowa: Possession of any amount 6 months in jail, 1,000 fine Wisconsin: Possession of any amount 6 months in jail, 1,000 fine Illinois and Michigan share a border in the middle of Lake Michigan, and cannabis possession is legal for adults in Michigan, but crossing state lines with cannabis remains technically illegal.

Not only are there now greater nationwide age restrictions when buying tobacco products, but Duke is launching a Smoke Free Campus initiative this summer. Looking at the history of smoking, its advertisements and its relation to Duke s campus can help us understand the impact and intentions of these changes. Tobaccoland reveals the complexities of marketing both for and against the tobacco industry. The exhibit s curators Hartman Center Reference Archivist Joshua Larkin Rowley, Head of Technical Services Meghan Lyon and Assistant University Archivist Amy McDonald created the exhibit using resources from the University Archives as well as books discussing the development of the tobacco industry. The photos, advertisements and artifacts of the exhibit show how Big Tobacco infiltrated both American media and life in Durham throughout the 20th century. It is known that cigarette advertising was once ubiquitous in the nation, but students often forget that Duke was founded on tobacco money. This exhibit displays the inherent connection between the Duke family, Durham and tobacco. Several defining pieces of Durham, including the American Tobacco Campus and the city s mascot (descending from Bull Durham smoking tobacco) are indicative of the city s success in tobacco manufacturing. Duke University had a number of researchers, including Paul Gross of Gross Hall , who were deeply involved in tobacco research, McDonald said. There were programs finding ways to farm tobacco in a more effective and economic way, but then there were also a lot of faculty members and students studying the composition of tobacco smoke and carcinogens, and that research was being fed to the different tobacco companies. Duke was connected to a lot of it. The university, however, was not consistent with its policies regarding smoking: Smoking was prohibited on campus in 1883, but by the 1920s, full page ads for Old Gold cigarettes filled The Chronicle. The stigmas and rules regarding smoking have fluctuated throughout the university s history, shifting as recently as this year s move toward a smoke free campus. Although the dangers of smoking are widely accepted today, preventative measures were often disregarded throughout the 20th century. The widespread ignorance of smoking s negative effects wasn t due to a lack of science, but rather the overwhelming influence of the tobacco industry in the media. The industry masterfully appealed to the salient demographics of a given era. Virginia Slims appealed to young working class women by stating that women are biologically superior to men, L M appealed to the Black Power movement by emphasizing African roots to be proud of and several companies attracted children with sugar sticks packaged as candy cigarettes. There have always been concerns over what the children are doing, concerns over appearances, who should be allowed to smoke and what is cool, Lyon said. All these different pieces seem cyclical, all the way back to the early marketing that the Dukes didn t necessarily invent smoking cigarettes , but certainly did popularize it . And yet, as long as people have been smoking, people have been fighting against smoking. Tobaccoland demonstrates how the movement against smoking is nothing new as early as 1868, there were publications demonizing smoking as a physical, mental, moral and social evil. Several books, posters and advertisements in the exhibit focused on the immorality of smoking to deter people from the habit. It wasn t until the 1980s, however, that the health implications of smoking entered public awareness. I think the more that public health advocates made the connection between diseases stemming from cigarettes, the more people started to push back on smoking in public and smoking around children, Lyon explained. There s been gradual public health campaigns that have gotten more funding based on litigation, but also general acceptance through the public. Such public health campaigns now look at the effects of e cigarettes, such as the widely popular JUUL. Tobaccoland illustrates how the development of these safer alternatives has followed the development of traditional tobacco products both were initially unpopular, both added flavors to increase popularity and both targeted the youth market with bright colors and advertisements on youth based platforms. Unfortunately, the long term effects of vaping have yet to be confirmed. By showing the advertising methods and secrets of the tobacco industry, Tobaccoland allows students to become more aware of how corporations manipulate the public for their interests. The exhibit suggests that by learning about the media of past corporations, we can protect ourselves from their modern descendants.

Clove Road,"Community board meetings resume this week STATEN ISLAND, N. Y. The aesthetics of a developer s plan to surround the Kreischer Mansion with a new active adult residential community will be presented to Community Board 3 s land use committee on Wednesday, Jan. 8. Architect Ron Victorio will make the presentation about the Charleston property at 7:30 p. m. in the board office, 1243 Woodrow Rd. The application is required because the mansion has been designated a historic landmark. Victorio is aiming to convince the committee that the plan by developer Isaac Yomtovian to build 48 homes for adults ages 55 and older is aesthetically appropriate to be placed on land adjacent to the historic home, located at 4500 Arthur Kill Rd. A plan to build 126 homes on the land, which had received approval in 2005, has been scrapped in favor of the active adult community, Victorio said. After the full Community Board votes later in the month, the plan will be brought to the Landmark Preservation Commission for approval on aesthetics. An LPC public hearing is scheduled for Feb. 4, he said. The development will pick up elements of the mansion, colors of the mansion, the style of the mansion, but will not copy it, Victorio said. ""The mansion has to remain the pinnacle on the hill,'' he said. ""The mansion has to be respected. '' The Community Board 3 Quality of Life Committee will meet on Tuesday, at 7:30 p. m. in the board office. Community Board 1 will consider several building applications on Wednesday, Jan. 8, at 7 p. m. , during a land use public hearing in its board headquarters, 1 Edgewater Plaza. On the table for approval are several proposals, including one for the enlargement of a diagnostic treatment facility at 1498 Clove Road. Additionally, the board will consider an application for the alteration of a steep slope for a new walkway and patio area at a single family home at 95 Louis Street in the Special Hillsides Preservation District. Also to be discussed are proposals in that district for the development of single family homes at 260 Brighton Ave. and at 50 Cedarcliff Road. In addition, the Community Board 1 Youth Committee will meet Tuesday at 7 p. m. in the board office. The Traffic/Transportation/Public Service committees of Community Board 2 will meet on Monday, Jan. 6 at 7:30 p. m. in the parish hall of New Dorp Moravian Church.

In Memoriam 2019: The Lives We Lost (And The Drivers Who Weren’t Charged) In Memoriam 2019: The Lives We Lost (And The Drivers Who Weren t Charged) Last year was the first year since the launch of Vision Zero in 2014 that the number of traffic fatalities increased. In 2019, 219 people died as a result of vehicle crashes in the five boroughs up from 203 in 2018. The dead include 29 cyclists, a triple digit percentage increase from 2018, when 10 were killed and 122 pedestrians up from 115 in 2018. Broken down by borough, eight people were killed in Staten Island, 27 in the Bronx (though no cyclists), 41 in Manhattan, 69 in Queens, and 74 in Brooklyn. The majority of dead cyclists 18 was in Brooklyn. The plurality of dead pedestrians 34 was also in Brooklyn. The primary culprit remains reckless drivers. Yet reckless drivers are so rarely charged: Car and truck drivers killed a combined 148 pedestrians and cyclists in 2019, yet 76 more than half! have not been charged. Breaking that down, only six drivers who killed cyclists were charged a rate of roughly one in five. And only 58 percent of drivers who killed pedestrians have received so much as a summons. Looking at the totality of the charges and matching them, case by case, to the deaths, it is difficult to understand why some drivers are punished and others are not. In some cases, the motorist was simply let off the hook by law enforcement but other times, the driver flees and has not been found, or police cannot prove that it was one driver behind the wheel at the time of the fatal crash. There s a number of obstacles and not the least of which is sometimes it s identifying the car is not the whole story. It s then who s driving the car and proving that they were in the car, said NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea during an unrelated press conference on crime statistics after initial publication of this story. Editor s note: In the weeks leading up to the new year, Streetsblog reached out repeatedly to the NYPD for updates on drivers who were not immediately charged, but may have been charged in the weeks and months after a crash. Our goal was to let the public see the results of investigations, which do indeed sometimes lead to charges. The NYPD did not respond to multiple emails, calls, an in person visit to NYPD headquarters, and personal button holing at cocktail parties. It is absolutely incomprehensible why the agency charged with bringing criminals to justice would not provide details of instances when it had, in fact, done so. So instead, Streetsblog culled various NYPD social media accounts, reviewed news reports, scoured publicly available data to compile this report. We apologize that some victims remain unidentified, but that information was also not provided by the NYPD. To honor the dead, we present our annual tribute to the people lost this year to violent drivers. Please share your remembrances in the comments section.

Update: Following publication, readers have reached out to identify some previously unidentified victims and correct details of their deaths.  HOV lane follies may be a reason to secede from New York state (opinion) STATEN ISLAND, N. Y. Even if Staten Island seceded from the city, we d still have dunderheaded decisions from New York state to deal with. Case in point: The unfinished HOV lane on the New Jersey bound side of the Staten Island Expressway. It seems simple enough: You build a lane for drivers with three or more passengers in their vehicles. You build the lane from the Verrazanno Narrows Bridge to the Goethals Bridge. You speed things along, and cars heading to Jersey never have to get in the local lanes at all. There s only one problem: The lane was never completely built out. It ends around Victory Boulevard. Which means that everybody has to cut back into the regular travel lanes once the HOV lane terminates. Which causes congestion. There have been efforts in past years to finish the job, and borough lawmakers have sent the flare up again in 2020. But the state Department of Transportation says that building the lane out won t improve traffic flow. Really? That makes me wonder if they think anything at all can be done to make traffic move better on the Staten Island Expressway. Or have we just given up? What makes this all the more galling is the fact that the expressway not that long ago underwent hundreds of millions of dollars in renovations. The end result being that some problems were fixed, while others were created. I still can t figure out why the entrance to the Brooklyn bound expressway at Targee Street was closed. All that does is force motorists to ride the service road all the way to the bridge, increasing traffic on the service road. Also unsolved by the renovation: The bottleneck at the Jersey bound entrance at Little Clove Road. Cars frequently back up onto Clove Road from the light at the entrance ramp. And cars often cut each other off as they jockey for position getting onto the highway itself. And then there s the exit only lane that got added to the Jersey bound lanes at Bradley Avenue. Too many people use it as an actual travel lane. The lane is long enough to allow it. Then they have to cut in at the actual Bradley exit. That causes congestion. And just down the road a piece, the cars are cutting back in from the truncated HOV lane, causing even more delays as well as dangerous jockeying for position. Couldn t anybody have foreseen this? And I m supposed to believe that building out the HOV lane wouldn t help even a little? How about building the lane out and just letting everybody use it? Would that not help? Because the HOV lane isn t operating as it s supposed to anyway. Too many people who don t have enough passengers in their vehicles use the lane. And true police enforcement is just about impossible. Who are we kidding? Look, I get it. There s going to be traffic. Some things just can t be avoided. And I m not even talking about the stuff you really can t control, like the accidents on the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn that cause the North Shore of the Island to become a frozen zone. But too many times Staten Islanders describe driving problem free throughout the tri state area," only to face a traffic calamity once they hit Staten Island. This happened to me this past Thanksgiving. I m sure it s happened to you plenty. It edges close to malpractice that the state DOT won t even consider extending the HOV lane. Maybe we should leave New York state entirely and see if New Jersey wants us to join them. Maybe they can help us with our traffic. We re running out of other options.

Kreischer Mansion,"Community board meetings resume this week STATEN ISLAND, N. Y. The aesthetics of a developer s plan to surround the Kreischer Mansion with a new active adult residential community will be presented to Community Board 3 s land use committee on Wednesday, Jan. 8. Architect Ron Victorio will make the presentation about the Charleston property at 7:30 p. m. in the board office, 1243 Woodrow Rd. The application is required because the mansion has been designated a historic landmark. Victorio is aiming to convince the committee that the plan by developer Isaac Yomtovian to build 48 homes for adults ages 55 and older is aesthetically appropriate to be placed on land adjacent to the historic home, located at 4500 Arthur Kill Rd. A plan to build 126 homes on the land, which had received approval in 2005, has been scrapped in favor of the active adult community, Victorio said. After the full Community Board votes later in the month, the plan will be brought to the Landmark Preservation Commission for approval on aesthetics. An LPC public hearing is scheduled for Feb. 4, he said. The development will pick up elements of the mansion, colors of the mansion, the style of the mansion, but will not copy it, Victorio said. ""The mansion has to remain the pinnacle on the hill,'' he said. ""The mansion has to be respected. '' The Community Board 3 Quality of Life Committee will meet on Tuesday, at 7:30 p. m. in the board office. Community Board 1 will consider several building applications on Wednesday, Jan. 8, at 7 p. m. , during a land use public hearing in its board headquarters, 1 Edgewater Plaza. On the table for approval are several proposals, including one for the enlargement of a diagnostic treatment facility at 1498 Clove Road. Additionally, the board will consider an application for the alteration of a steep slope for a new walkway and patio area at a single family home at 95 Louis Street in the Special Hillsides Preservation District. Also to be discussed are proposals in that district for the development of single family homes at 260 Brighton Ave. and at 50 Cedarcliff Road.

Trancas Street,"Take the Napa County highway trivia quiz Napa County has six highways and freeways running through it or is it seven? The answer to this seemingly straightforward question isn t quite clear. Here s a trivia but hopefully not trivial look at the county s main roads. What is the shortest stretch of highway or freeway within the county? This ends up being a trick question. Some maps show about 1,000 feet of Highway 37 passing through Napa County, others show it staying in Sonoma and Solano counties. Napa County Public Works Director Steven Lederer said he think Highway 37 does enter Napa County, but it s hard to tell. Planning, Building and Environmental Services Director David Morrison said Google Earth shows a segment might be in Napa County, though he s inclined to say no. County Assessor John Tuteur said no. Take away the Highway 37 conundrum and the answer is Interstate 80. The southeast corner of the county takes in a mile of the freeway between Vallejo and Fairfield. What is Napa County s longest stretch of highway or freeway? Highway 29, the Napa Valley s main drag. It traverses the entire county north to south, from the remote, forested Lake County line near Mount St. Helena to bustling, congested American Canyon. That s a distance of about 49 miles. Highway 128 cutting west to east across the county is almost as long, at 46.5 miles. This highway enters the northern county from Sonoma County, runs down the Napa Valley sharing the Highway 29 route, cuts east on Rutherford Road, then heads past Lake Hennessey and Lake Berryessa to Solano County. What are the six or seven highways and freeways stretches in Napa County? Highways 12, 29, 121, 128 and 221 and I 80 for sure, with Highway 37 a possibility. When did the Jameson Canyon highway get built? With automobiles becoming popular, the state in 1912 announced it would spend 18 million on a state highway system. Napa County wanted to be included. California was securing local right of way in 1914. The cement highway would come westward from Sacramento through Fairfield, go through Jameson Canyon into Napa County, pass through the city of Napa, then cut west to Sonoma County and beyond. A milestone came in November 1918. The new state highway south of Napa was thrown open to the public Monday, the Weekly Calistogan reported. This is a great boon to automobilists bound for Vallejo or Sacramento points, for it does away with the wide detour so long necessary out through Coombsville. In December, 1919, California completed the state highway section from the city of Napa to Stanly Lane heading toward Sonoma. Meanwhile, the county also worked on county highways, such as today s Highway 29 route up Napa Valley. What is the busiest Napa County highway/freeway? No, it s not Highway 29 in American Canyon, the city of Napa or the Upvalley not by a long shot. Highway 29 at its busiest point in Napa County near First Street in the city of Napa carries about 71,000 vehicles daily. That short stretch of I 80 in the south county carries around 145,000, according to Caltrans. Does Napa County have a state scenic highway? No. But the county has some contenders, should local officials ever want to the state to put up those scenic highway signs with the poppy. California law passed in 1963 allowed for state scenic highways and listed eligible highways. Listed for Napa County are Highway 29 from Vallejo to the city of Napa, Highway 29 from the city of Napa to Lake County, Highway 221 and Silverado Trail (Highway 121) south of Trancas Street. Last year, Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar Curry, D Winters, carried legislation that makes Highway 128 eligible. But the state doesn t impose scenic highway status on counties. Napa County has yet to apply and show its roads meet the criteria. You can reach Barry Eberling at 256 2253 or beberling napanews. com. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

Bay Area stationery retailer Papyrus to close all U.S. stores [Mercury News] Jan. 23 WALNUT CREEK Everything must go reads the sign hanging in the window of the Papyrus store in Broadway Plaza. In the latest sign of retail industry woes, the parent company of the card, stationery and paper gifts chain is closing more than 250 stores in the U. S. and laying off hundreds of employees. The retailer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In addition to the brick and mortar store sales, Papyrus is also offering 20 percent discounts on online purchases. Papyrus and the Schurman Retail Group, its parent company, were founded in the Fairfield kitchen of Marcel and Margrit Schurman, according to the Papyrus website. The couple started out importing European paper products and opened their first brick and mortar location in Berkeley in 1973. Nine years later, Dominique Schurman, the couple s daughter, began working for her parents and rising to serve as CEO. Schurman said this about the closure in a statement: Despite our Herculean efforts to realign our Papyrus and American Greetings stores to fit today s shopping environment, Schurman Retail Group had to make the difficult decision to close all 254 of our stores in North America, which will impact our workforce of about 1,400 employees. We will close most stores over the next 4 6 weeks. We want to thank all of our loyal customers for their patronage of our proud family business started by my parents 70 years ago. The chain, which also sells greeting cards and gift wrap, has these locations in California, according to the company website: Berkeley: 2924 College Avenue and 1793 Fourth Street Burlingame: 1227 Burlingame Avenue Corte Madera: 1726 Redwood Highway Danville: 401B Hartz Avenue Lafayette: 3645 Mt.

Larkmead Vineyards,"Larkmead Vineyards honors influential viticulture researcher with $200,000 gift to UC Davis The donation will preserve and digitize the work of the late Professor Emeritus Dr. Harold Olmo Dr. Harold Olmo helped pushed the Napa Valley into one of the world s top wine growing regions for cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. Last year I was sitting with Cam and Kate Solari Baker at their Larkmead Vineyards estate in Calistoga, tasting new releases and discussing their history that dates back to 1895. One of the wines that we tasted was the Larkmead Dr. Olmo 2015, a 100 percent cabernet sauvignon release from the same vines that were planted and studied over 80 years ago by Dr. Harold Olmo, who was a professor of viticulture at UC Davis. When Napa Valley icon, Larry Solari (Kate s father) purchased the winery in 1948, he and Dr. Olmo became fast friends and they worked together on clonal research that led to the production of highly sought after grapes from their property. Cam and Kate Solari Baker of Larkmead Vineyards in Calistoga. The Bakers initially honored the professor in 2015 with the release of the Larkmead Dr. Olmo 2013. Now, they are celebrating the winery s 125th birthday with a 200,000 gift to the UC Davis Library to preserve and digitize the work of the late Professor Emeritus who is considered by many as one of California s most prominent viticulture researchers. More than archiving Dr. Olmo s work, they anticipate that much of the effort can open doors into the future. In a statement about the gift, University Librarian and Vice Provost of Digital Scholarship MacKenzie Smith said, As we preserve and increase access to these documents, we hope to uncover elements of Dr. Olmo s research that could provide new insight into modern day generations. Cam Baker added, Napa Valley owes much of its success as a wine region to him. It s our hope that through the digitization and analysis of Dr. Olmo s research, more findings will come to light that will guide Napa Valley into its next chapter. Dr. Harold Olmo. (Courtesy photo) Dr. Harold Olmo joined the faculty of the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology in 1938 and over the ensuing years was not only instrumental in developing the finest university program of its kind, but also helped pushed the Napa Valley into one of the world s top wine growing regions for cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. During his lengthy career he introduced over 30 grape varietals, but it was his development of the Oakville clones that catapulted Napa into stardom. His worldwide travels and discoveries helped amass an extensive grapes collection that earned him the nickname, the Indiana Jones of viticulture. Kate Solari Baker, who grew up on the Larkmead estate, has seen firsthand the sustainability of Dr. Olmo s work. The true effects of Dr. Olmo s research are long term. Today, we actually have Dr. Olmo s groundbreaking Oakville clones planted in the vineyard, meaning that our cabernet sauvignon wines are in part a direct result of his work and legacy. Larkmead Vineyards winemaker Dan Petroski. (Courtesy photo) Larkmead winemaker Dan Petroski describes Dr. Olmo s research as fearless and says that he was always motivated to do whatever work was necessary to find the answer. However, he is hopeful that preservation of Dr. Olmo s research can provide future insights as he continues to help shape future discussions on climate change and wine. Hosted by Petroski, the Salons at Larkmead are discussion based forums for fellow winemakers, industry leaders, and journalists shaping the narrative on climate change. Larkmead Vineyards has created a new three acre research block on its property. (Courtesy photo) To that end, Petroski and Larkmead are spearheading an effort similar to that recently implemented in the Bordeaux region of France, by dedicating three acres of the 110 acre estate to experiment with new grapes varietals that may be more suitable to warming temperatures. The plot will be planted with grapes like tempranillo, touriga nacional and aglianico that normally thrive in regions of Spain and Portugal where it is significantly warmer. Petroski adds, Climate change is very real and already affects vintners around the world. The fact is, cabernet sauvignon may no longer be well suited to Napa Valley s climate in 20 to 30 years. As one of the world s top wine regions, we need to research and plan for inevitable warmer temperatures. The real story here is that Larkmead Vineyards is leading the effort to preserve the past and guide the future dialogue on one of the largest issues to ever confront, not only the wine industry, but the entire planet. The menu of the estate wines, while elegant, remains narrow and consistent. The Larkmead Wines, released in the fall, include three cabernet sauvignon wines called The Lark, Dr. Olmo and Solari and a rare Italian wine called tocai friulano from a small patch on the estate. The Vineyard Series/Spring releases include another cabernet sauvignon, the merlot dominant Firebelle, LMV Salon, a blend of cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon, and the well structured Lillie, a sauvignon blanc in honor of Lillie Coit, who lived at the estate for many years.

It s covered with a mix of straight lines that represent travel by air, dashed lines for car or horse including at times a wild horse known as a burro and dash and dot lines to show travel by train. Together they represent 12,000 miles covered by Harold Olmo in one year, while collecting plant seeds and cuttings that today form a key part of UC Davis collection of genetically diverse grapes. It is undoubtedly among the most impressive collections in the world. If you had to list the qualities needed to be a vine geneticist, you might think of placing research skills at the top of the list. Patience, intellect and a working knowledge of laboratory equipment from a microscope to a computer would probably all be priorities. And, of course, you wouldn t be too far out former UC Davis professor Carole Meredith, who took over as Olmo s successor three years after his retirement in 1977, recalls that during her tenure (from 1980 to 2003) technology was essential for the pioneering work she undertook to uncover, among other things, DNA sequencing of grapes. But the most important tools for her predecessor were (and I quote from an interview in Grape Collective) his own eyes and a pair of vineyard boots . They certainly helped Olmo build up a reputation as one of the world s most formidable and fearless researchers. Born in San Francisco in 1909, Olmo got his early education in horticulture at the University of California, Berkeley, then earned his doctorate from Berkeley in plant genetics. He began working in the field during Prohibition, making his first grape cross in 1931, and his work was essential to rebuilding the wine industry in the country after Prohibition was repealed in 1933. He joined UC Davis as assistant professor of viticulture in 1938, and remained there until his retirement, by which time he was professor emeritus. He created, among other things, a grapevine quarantine facility for imported vines, the highly prized Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon clone and a wide range of Chardonnay clones, all aimed at unlocking the best flavours and complexity within the Californian climate. And through it all, he continued to travel widely, becoming consultant to the UN for more than 20 years, as well as a Guggenheim Fellow and a Fulbright scholar. He died in 2006 one month before his 97th birthday, I had heard of Olmo when UC Davis contacted me about writing this story, but only in the most general of terms. And then a few days after I had been sent some of his research papers, I met up by coincidence with Bonny Meyer, wife of Justin Meyer and co founder of Silver Oak Cellars in Napa. Within a few minutes of chatting it turned out that, while writing her PhD (in a non related field), her desk was stationed in Olmo s office, and he had become a firm family friend. I remember he had filing cabinets full of research lined up against his office walls, said Bonny, with the drawers labelled Book One, Book Two, Book Three and so on. He was too busy to ever sit down and write those books, and I often wondered if that was why he wasn t more widely known outside of the industry. Today the contents of those drawers, in the form of correspondence, research files, slides on grape varieties, grape variety reports by county, and materials from various symposiums, conferences, and advisory boards, are held at UC Davis, under file collection number D280. The papers are recorded as covering 100 linear feet , which in non library speak means they would stretch 30 metres if laid out in standard archive boxes end to end. That s a lot of information. Compare it, for example, to 33.4 linear feet that UC Davis holds from Jancis Robinson MW, or 47.6 linear feet from Robert Mondavi, or 64.5 linear feet from Maynard Amerine. It s information that, to date, had only been accessible to visitors to the library. But a recent bursary from the owners of Larkmead Vineyards, where Olmo established a research plot in 1939, will preserve and digitise the collection so that it can be shared more widely. The first serious records should be available to consult online over the next 12 to 15 months, with archivist Beth Forrestal and head of special collections Kevin Miller currently working through them. The first step is to organise and describe the material in the collection down to item level. Right now it is described down to folder level, said UC Davis Axel Borg. The problem with Olmo s papers is that he would put several different items that he was working on into one folder. Let s say that he was economical. Once this process has taken place, we can expect to find invaluable information about a range of topics, including suggestions of varieties and clones that can thrive in the face of drought and heat issues, or that are resistant in the face of disease. But it s not just wine scholars and grape growers who should be lining up. Aspiring screen writers might want to take a browse also. It turns out that Olmo was called the Indiana Jones of viticulture for a reason. He spoke five languages, plus sign language, and was able to pick up local dialects within hours of being in an area , according to his daughter, Jeanne Marie. She tells of one story when, while searching for wild grapevines in the Kashmir Pass, the Afghan government insisted he take an armed escort of 20 soldiers because local warlords were fighting each other. Another time his driver ran their car off the road in an accident, and abandoned him. Olmo was eventually found by Nomads who cared for him and nursed him back to health. And then there was the arrest following an unfortunate fatal collision between donkey and car, which led to him being held in a local jail until he could buy a replacement donkey, with a little help from the American consulate. And he never stopped working, patenting his last grape aged 96, just a few months before his death. As soon as one question was answered, he was off to another, as Jeanne Marie puts it, still clearly taking great delight in talking about her father almost 15 years after his death. And when the rest of us get to comb through his travel diaries, I m thinking we re all going to be doing the same.

Financial details were not disclosed. The move marks a fresh chapter for Stony Hill, one of the legendary names of Napa Valley winemaking and which saw its first harvest in 1952. It is the latest of several deals involving businessman Gaylon Lawrence. He and McCoy Jr acquired Burgess Cellars in September. McCoy is president and CEO of Heitz Cellar, which Lawrence acquired in 2018 following that up in 2019 by acquiring Haynes Vineyard in Napa s Coombsville AVA. At Stony Hill, the new owners have appointed Jaimee Motley as winemaker. Stony Hill Vineyard has held a special place in my heart since my initial visit to the winery in 2011 after the harvest, said Motley, who has been assistant winemaker at Pax Wine Cellars and also launched wines under her own name. The estate feels as if there are ten different clos within the property and each of those parcels has the ability to present us a looking glass into the history of California terroir and the future of transparent winegrowing, she said. I look forward to maintaining a deep reverence with the land, honouring the past, and embracing the future of Stony Hill. Laurie Taboulet, who was formerly national sales manager at Larkmead Vineyards, has been appointed Stony Hill s estate director. Stony Hill was founded by Fred and Eleanor McCrea, who bought the property in 1943 as a weekend getaway. They initially planted 2.4 hectares of vines (six acres), including Chardonnay, Riesling and Pinot Blanc, and the first wines quickly found favour with wine lovers in the 1950s. Gew rztraminer, S millon, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah were later added. Fred McCrea developed the winemaking, while Eleanor handled the business side. After Fred s death in 1977, his assistant Michael Chelini took on the winemaking for the subsequent 40 years. During that time, in 1991, the McCreas son Peter and daughter in law, Willinda, assumed day to day management of the winery. In 2011, their daughter Sarah joined the business, although in 2018 a majority stake in Stony Hill was sold to Ted Hall and family owners of Long Meadow Ranch.

Silverado Trail,"Take the Napa County highway trivia quiz Napa County has six highways and freeways running through it or is it seven? The answer to this seemingly straightforward question isn t quite clear. Here s a trivia but hopefully not trivial look at the county s main roads. What is the shortest stretch of highway or freeway within the county? This ends up being a trick question. Some maps show about 1,000 feet of Highway 37 passing through Napa County, others show it staying in Sonoma and Solano counties. Napa County Public Works Director Steven Lederer said he think Highway 37 does enter Napa County, but it s hard to tell. Planning, Building and Environmental Services Director David Morrison said Google Earth shows a segment might be in Napa County, though he s inclined to say no. County Assessor John Tuteur said no. Take away the Highway 37 conundrum and the answer is Interstate 80. The southeast corner of the county takes in a mile of the freeway between Vallejo and Fairfield. What is Napa County s longest stretch of highway or freeway? Highway 29, the Napa Valley s main drag. It traverses the entire county north to south, from the remote, forested Lake County line near Mount St. Helena to bustling, congested American Canyon. That s a distance of about 49 miles. Highway 128 cutting west to east across the county is almost as long, at 46.5 miles. This highway enters the northern county from Sonoma County, runs down the Napa Valley sharing the Highway 29 route, cuts east on Rutherford Road, then heads past Lake Hennessey and Lake Berryessa to Solano County. What are the six or seven highways and freeways stretches in Napa County? Highways 12, 29, 121, 128 and 221 and I 80 for sure, with Highway 37 a possibility. When did the Jameson Canyon highway get built? With automobiles becoming popular, the state in 1912 announced it would spend 18 million on a state highway system. Napa County wanted to be included. California was securing local right of way in 1914. The cement highway would come westward from Sacramento through Fairfield, go through Jameson Canyon into Napa County, pass through the city of Napa, then cut west to Sonoma County and beyond. A milestone came in November 1918. The new state highway south of Napa was thrown open to the public Monday, the Weekly Calistogan reported. This is a great boon to automobilists bound for Vallejo or Sacramento points, for it does away with the wide detour so long necessary out through Coombsville. In December, 1919, California completed the state highway section from the city of Napa to Stanly Lane heading toward Sonoma. Meanwhile, the county also worked on county highways, such as today s Highway 29 route up Napa Valley. What is the busiest Napa County highway/freeway? No, it s not Highway 29 in American Canyon, the city of Napa or the Upvalley not by a long shot. Highway 29 at its busiest point in Napa County near First Street in the city of Napa carries about 71,000 vehicles daily. That short stretch of I 80 in the south county carries around 145,000, according to Caltrans. Does Napa County have a state scenic highway? No. But the county has some contenders, should local officials ever want to the state to put up those scenic highway signs with the poppy. California law passed in 1963 allowed for state scenic highways and listed eligible highways. Listed for Napa County are Highway 29 from Vallejo to the city of Napa, Highway 29 from the city of Napa to Lake County, Highway 221 and Silverado Trail (Highway 121) south of Trancas Street. Last year, Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar Curry, D Winters, carried legislation that makes Highway 128 eligible. But the state doesn t impose scenic highway status on counties. Napa County has yet to apply and show its roads meet the criteria. You can reach Barry Eberling at 256 2253 or beberling napanews. com. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

Merritt Parkway,"Woog’s World: Westport is full of double standards Here in Westport, we sometimes wear our hands out patting ourselves on the back. First plastic bag ban east of the Mississippi: Check! Plastic straw ban: Check! Sustainability task force, Go Green initiatives, net zero by 2050 check, check, check! Yet if you check under the hood, we re hardly as virtuous as we d like to think. The town that leads Connecticut in per capita Tesla registrations is also chock a block with Range Rovers, Grand Cherokees, and enough SUVs to sustain an entire United Arab Emirate. We build energy efficient homes and keep the swimming pool heated and open through Thanksgiving. Those same homes have so many rooms that some of them don t even have names. They also have four car garages because it s an unwritten rule that in Westport every driver needs his or her own vehicle. We live our lives a lot like that. Westport has its yin and yang we re torn between the push toward progressivism and the pull to be just another American suburb (if quite a bit wealthier). We revere our history. Newcomers move here for the New England charm, the lovely streetscape, the sense that this place is rooted in and honors its past. Yet we tear down those same homes with abandon, not to mention the century old trees surrounding them. We build faux stone walls and add fences on top, shutting the streetscape off from the street. We love our neighborhoods, but we have no idea who our neighbors are. We love the concept of mom and pop stores too. We all wish there were more of them everywhere. But we shop online, not at Savvy Grace, Indulge by Mersene or Le Rouge by Aarti. We hit them up every time we solicit donations for a benefit we learned long ago that chains are chintzy but we seldom say thank you with our feet and our wallets. Westporters are fitness fanatics. We go to the gym, spin centers and yoga classes. And we drive maniacally there, cutting off everyone in our path in our zeal to park as close to the entrance as possible. We are not pleased that our roads have been overtaken by every driver on the Merritt Parkway, and every driver and trucker on I 95. We bemoan the fact that Waze has made not only the Post Road but Cross Highway, Long Lots and Greens Farms Road into just slightly better alternatives any time there is a fender bender on the highway. Yet who among us has not used Waze to do the same, in some other town? We love to say we are an arts loving community. We are rightfully proud of many organizations, including the Artists Collective of Westport. This vibrant, eclectic group has found a home at the Westport Country Playhouse s Sheffer Studio. But if we really walked the arts talk, we d fill the Playhouse to capacity for every show. One of the first summer theaters in the country and about to celebrate its 90th season the Playhouse deserves far better support from our arts loving community than it gets. Westport is an extremely generous town. We volunteer, fundraise, walk and work for an astonishing variety of causes. We donate furniture for immigrants, give toys to impoverished kids, and tutor adults whose education fell far short of our own. We appreciate the dedication of our town employees. We would not be the Westport we are without our teachers, firefighters, police officers, EMTs, Public Works workers and many more. Some of them live absurd distances from Westport they can t afford to live here. We have done a decent job of providing housing for some low income residents far better than tightly written state regulations give us credit for but we could do more. Not every developer comes in with nefarious plans not all use affordable housing as an extortion sword to hang over our heads. There are legitimate ways to provide more housing to folks who can t otherwise afford Westport, and whose presence could greatly enrich our entire community. Does all this make us hypocritical? I don t think so. I can t imagine that Westport is any more or less conflicted than any other community. It s possible to want to take the virtuous high road, yet flip off the other driver when (this one s on you, Waze) the road gets too crowded. But that doesn t mean we can t be better. We always can. We can curb our waste. We can care for our past. We can shop locally. We can become Playhouse patrons. We can remind ourselves that we live in a wonderful, caring community one we are blessed to enjoy. And we can never forget that with that privilege comes great responsibility. That s my wish for the new year and the new decade.  State Police Charge Fotis Dulos with Murder, Kidnapping [UPDATED] Fotis Dulos killed his estranged, fearful wife on the morning of May 24, 2019, in the New Canaan home where she and their five kids had been living for more than one year, according to a state police detective s sworn affidavit made public Tuesday. He d left Farmington at daybreak that Friday morning in a pickup truck and took the Merritt Parkway to New Canaan, pulling off of Lapham Road alongside Waveny and then pedaling to her Wells Lane home on a bicycle from his own childhood that he d brought to the United States when he moved here from his native Greece, according to an arrest warrant application (see PDF below) from Detective John Kimball of the state police Western District Major Crime Squad. Once at the house, Fotis Dulos laid in waiting for her, officials have said. The last known image of Jennifer Dulos alive is captured 8:05 a. m. by a neighbor s video surveillance system she s driving her SUV home after dropping the kids off at school. A subsequent analysis of the garage, house and SUV by the state s chief medical examiner, including bloodstains, blood spatter and blood loss, led the state official, Dr. James Gill, to determine that Jennifer Dulos sustained an injury or injuries that would be non survivable without medical intervention. Gill categorized the event as a homicide of violence where 36 inch zip ties were used to secure and incapacitate Jennifer Dulos for some time period to prevent her escape. The murder itself likely included some combination of traumatic, blunt force injuries such as a bludgeoning/beating and/or sharp force injuries such as a stabbing/slashing, according to Kimball s affidavit. Fotis Dulos then packages Jennifer Dulos at the house, using plastic zip ties and places her inside her own SUV, then cleans the garage using supplies he finds in the garage and paper towels from the kitchen, Kimball said in the arrest warrant application. A nanny would arrive about an hour after Fotis Dulos left with his estranged wife s body, apparently on the passenger seat of the SUV that he reverse into a space off of Lapham Road, near where d parked the pickup that morning. Back inside the house, Lauren Almeida found Jennifer Dulos s unopened granola bar and mug of tea on the kitchen counter, and noticed that a paper towel roll near the sink needed to be replaced. Almeida found it incredibly strange that there were just two fresh rolls of paper towels left in the pantry, since she d stocked it with a brand new 12 pack the night before. Almeida soon picked up four of the Dulos kids and they ate lunch in their own kitchen. At that point, no one knew their home was the scene of a violent crime it was still several hours before Jennifer Dulos, usually responsive to phone calls and texts, would be reported missing to police. On discovering that Jennifer Dulos hadn t shown for a children s orthodontist appointment at 4:40 p. m. , Almeida said her first thought was that Fotis did something, that something happened and that Fotis was most likely involved, according to Kimball s affidavit. He was, according to newly released details of a months long local, state and federal police investigation. On Tuesday, state arrested Fotis Dulos already charged twice with felony tampering and hindering for what appear to be botched cover up jobs on charges of murder, felony murder and kidnapping. His one time girlfriend Michelle Troconis, also charged twice with tampering, was arrested for conspiracy to commit murder, as was a friend, Connecticut attorney Kent Mawhinny. New Canaan Police, minutes before issuing a brief statement saying that Fotis Dulos had been arrested on Tuesday morning, posted a single word to the agency s Twitter account: Justice! Kimball s 35 page affidavit includes new details in an ongoing investigation and missing person case that has generated concern and wide support in New Canaan for Jennifer Dulos s family, while also piquing curiosity and interest nationally. A friend of Jennifer Dulos s family issued the following statement in the wake of this week s arrests: Above all we thank the Connecticut State Police and the New Canaan Police Department, as well as the assisting local departments for their tireless commitment and diligent, painstaking work that have led to these arrests. Although we are relieved the the wait for these changes is over, for us there is no sense of closure. Nothing can bring Jennifer back. We miss her every day. We will forever mourn her loss. We believe the arrest warrants will speak for themselves. We ask that you please respect our privacy during this time. Many of those following the case have speculated as to whether or not a murder charge could be brought against Fotis Dulos even without a physical body, should authorities come to believe the worst, as it now appears. In many ways, the new information sheds light on areas that long have puzzled those following the case for example, the question of how Fotis Dulos traveled from Lapham Road to Welles Lane after parking near the southwestern corner of Waveny (there s video surveillance that shows him riding the distinctive bicycle on Weed Street). The arrest warrant applications, signed by Superior Court Judge John Blawie, also lay out Fotis Dulos s financial difficulties at the time of his wife s disappearance and detail for the first time the location of bloodstains and both of their DNA on several items in the home and on a car in the garage at Welles Lane. An item that Kimball notes multiple times in the affidavit is a pair of white camping pillows that Almeida noticed in the days after Jennifer Dulos s disappearance had gone missing from the south garage bay at her New Canaan home. They d only been used twice by the Dulos children during a school trip. Almeida had noticed the pillows within the past two months while searching for an old towel to use for an activity with the children, Kimball said in the application. The pillows appear to have become part of a sloppy dump run that Fotis Dulos and Troconis took the day after the murder, leading to the first charges brought against them. Police used phone location and video surveillance evidence to show that they steered a black pickup truck through north Hartford, making 30 stops to dump bags in trash cans and storm drains, including items that later tested positive for Jennifer Dulos s blood. (Police had seized Fotis Dulos s phone during a May 25 interview with him at NCPD headquarters Kimball revealed in the new arrest warrant application that his passcode was 0 0 0 0. ) During the dump run, one surveillance camera showed that several plastic bags can be seen in the rear bed the pickup that Fotis Dulos was driving with Troconis in the passenger seat. Less than two minutes later, after turning onto a different road and making a U Turn, the pickup truck passes the same camera and the rear bed of the truck is seen to hold only one black plastic bag. An additional video from the Hartford Police Department Special Operations Group Capital City Command Center showed Dulos remove what appeared to be a large, rigid object from the rear of the Ford Raptor and lean it up against a building. The object was consistent with the appearance of a WeatherTech brand rear cargo liner determined to be missing from Jennifer s 2017 Chevrolet Suburban, Kimball s affidavit said. Capital City Command Center video also showed an unidentified person removing what appears to be a light colored piece of material containing a large blood like stain. This item appeared consistent with one of two small camping pillows which Jennifer s nanny Lauren Almeida reported were missing from the garage storage shelves at the 69 Welles Lane crime scene. Investigators subsequently identified and interviewed the homeless male who told investigators he had seen what he described as a bloody pillow but he had not taken the item. Also new in the Kimball affidavit was a detailed list of evidence that police recovered from garbage bags that were dumped in Hartford that Saturday. The evidence includes cleanup and other items with bloodstains and DNA from Jennifer Dulos, Fotis Dulos and Troconis, including a sponge, mop handle, clear poncho, bra, Vineyard Vines striped shirt, garden glove, duct tape and zip ties. Most of the accusations against Troconis and Mawhinny revolve around lying to police in attempts to provide Fotis Dulos with alibis around the time of the murder, and their help in his efforts to cover up the crime by eliminating evidence. For example, Fotis Dulos had left his own cellphone back in Farmington on the morning he drove to New Canaan to kill his wife, according to Kimball s affidavit. A friend from overseas called Fotis Dulos s hone and Mawhinny instructed Troconis to pick it up so that the 17 second call that followed was officially logged into the system, the affidavit said. Troconis s involvement in the cover up appeared to go much further, as she accompanied Fotis Dulos not only on the dump run, but was also actively helping him develop an alibi, clean up a house where he went directly after the murder, bring the pickup truck he d used to make his trip to New Canaan to a car wash for detailing and withhold that information from an employee of Fotis Dulos s construction company who owned that vehicle. Both Troconis and Mawhinny changed their stories multiple times about their interactions with Fotis Dulos on the morning and afternoon of May 24. During a second interview with police last summer, Troconis was asked if there was tension between Dulos and herself because of his divorce and the problems surrounding it, according to Kimball s application. Her response was, We fight all the time. Detectives asked Troconis if the turmoil might be a motivating factor to get rid of Jennifer. Troconis reported that Dulos had expressed to her that he never thought Jennifer would do this to him, and that he never saw this side of her. Troconis also conveyed Dulos had told her, Sometimes I hope she disappears. Also during a police interview, When Troconis was told that Dulos had killed his wife and involved her Troconis in the clean up, she responded by saying, That s like even worse. I hate him because of that. Affiant Kimball told Troconis, He got you in trouble. Troconis replied, But I was cleaning the house. I wasn t cleaning Jennifer. Fotis Dulos is being held on 6 million bond, while bond for Troconis and Mawhinny was set at 2 million apiece. They have yet to be arraigned on the new charges. Fotis Dulos already is scheduled to appear Thursday in state Superior Court in Stamford on the prior charges, while Troconis is scheduled to appear Jan. 31.  Estranged husband charged with murder in missing wife case The arrest Tuesday capped months of searches by police for Farber Dulos, who was last seen dropping off her children at a school in New Canaan on May 24. Authorities have searched woods, ponds, trash plants and houses from New Canaan to Farmington but have been unable to find any trace of the 51 year old Farber Dulos other than a blood stained shirt found in a Hartford trash can they believe she was wearing the last time she was seen alive. CT STATE POLICE have provided an update and a glimpse inside of their search of a Hartford trash plant in the JenniferDulos case. https://t. co/72cUqpaIuj pic. twitter. com/dkLJUouiZ2 FOX61 ( FOX61News) June 22, 2019 Pattis said he pulled up to Dulos' house at Jefferson Crossing in Farmington at 11 a. m. Tuesday, 10 minutes before a convoy of five unmarked state police cruisers, one with flashing red and blue lights, swept into the residential compound. The state police cars surrounded the front entrance to the house and left after about 15 minutes with a handcuffed Dulos in one of their vehicles.

Credit: Mark Mirko Credit: Mark Mirko Today is a somber day, Pattis said while standing at the entrance to Jefferson Crossing after the vehicles had departed. I m not surprised that the state decided to bring the charge. I'll be surprised if they can win it. Mr. Dulos contends that he was not involved, and I don't think the evidence will show that he was. He said it was his understanding that the court put a 6 million bond on Dulos with the condition that he cannot post it until after he is arraigned. You can imagine what it's like to say to someone, prepare for the bottom to fall out of your world. In a paradoxical way, we welcome this fight because we think we will win it. In fact, we're confident we will. And now we won't have to speculate about what it looks like any longer, Pattis said. New Canaan Police tweeted shortly after Dulos' arrest. More about Fotis Dulos Dulos, 52, a Farmington luxury homebuilder, has been arrested twice and charged with tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution in connection with the disappearance of Farber Dulos. He has been free on two separate 500,000 bonds. Dulos has steadfastly maintained he had nothing to do with his wife's disappearance, and Pattis has suggested a variety of theories of what happened to her from a Gone Girl scenario where she faked her own death and is still alive to a ""revenge suicide theory speculating that she killed herself and made it look like Fotis Dulos was involved to keep their children away from him.

Credit: Mark Mirko Credit: Mark Mirko The couple has been going through a long, bitter divorce since June 2017 with a judge severely limiting Dulos' access to his five children over the last year. Dulos was first arrested in early June. Police in court documents said surveillance video from the Albany Avenue area in Hartford showed Dulos dumping two black trash bags into garbage cans on that street. The cameras also showed him putting a FedEx package into a storm drain right in front of Michelle Troconis, his girlfriend at the time, police said. Investigation and evidence Police later retrieved the FedEx package, which had an old license plate belonging to a car Dulos no longer owned in it. They have never explained what connection, if any, the old license plate has to the case. State police detectives also recovered a shirt with blood on it that they believed Farber Dulos was wearing the day she disappeared, a bloody mop and some towels from the trash. DNA testing revealed the blood on those items belonged to Farber Dulos. Two days after the trash bags were dumped on Albany Avenue, a homeless man found one of them and inside he said he found a bloody pillow and a knife that he later sold for 5 for a rock of crack cocaine to a man named Fudge. Fudge said he later sold the knife to a man for 10 to buy food. He was unable to identify the man to police, and the knife has never been found. The girlfriend Michelle Troconis, who was referred to as the Argentinian paramour in court papers by Farber Dulos' divorce attorney, also has been arrested twice on tampering with evidence charges. She is free on a 500,000 bond and a 150,000 bond, respectively.

File photo. pic. twitter. com/oC4Wjmce8e Courtney Zieller ( courtneyzieller) January 7, 2020 The bond after her second arrest in September was lower because she has cooperated with state police detectives. She recently also moved her remaining belongings from the Farmington home she shared with Dulos. She now lives in Avon. What s in the arrest warrant It was after the second arrests that Norwalk/Stamford State's Attorney Richard Colangelo released a 43 page detailed arrest warrant affidavit that laid out the case against Dulos. State police obtained video surveillance from gas stations, home security systems and New Canaan school buses to document the trail of a red Toyota truck as it drove from Farmington to New Canaan earlier on the morning of May 24. The truck belonged to Pawel Gumienny, an employee of Dulos' home building company, The Fore Group Inc. , who had let Dulos use it while he drove Dulos' black Ford Raptor to a job site in New Canaan. Gumienny is expected to be a key witness for the prosecution. The arrest warrant affidavit said the truck is first seen on a gas station surveillance camera along the Merritt Parkway in Fairfield at 6:36 a. m. that day. The truck is captured parked on Lapham Road in New Canaan at 7:40 a. m. by a school bus camera. The truck is parked less than 100 feet from where Farber Dulos' white Chevy Suburban was found later that same night. Police believe that Dulos left his truck there and went to his estranged wife's home about 3 miles away and waited for her to return from bringing the children to school. The white Suburban can be seen returning to her Welles Lane home at 8:05 a. m. It is seen leaving at 10:24 a. m. , and police allege Dulos was driving it and the body of his wife was inside of it. They theorize that he was lying in wait for her in the garage and attacked her there, according to court documents.  Dan Haar: A pro-toll senator lashes out at the diluted plan Democrats will barrel ahead with a vote on tolls for trucks at a dozen locations as soon as next Wednesday, sources at the Capitol say, adopting the measure with apparently zero Republican votes. That will give Gov. Ned Lamont some of the money the state needs to shore up aging bridges. Still unclear is whether Sen. Alex Bergstein, D Greenwich, will vote for the final package. That matters not because the Senate needs her vote it might have the needed 18 yeses without her but because of what she stands for and says. I am woefully disappointed in what s being presented to us now, Bergstein told me Wednesday. It s like putting a Band Aid on a patient who needs emergency surgery. Bergstein, perhaps alone in the General Assembly, certainly alone in the Senate, is willing to say loudly and with fervor that her colleagues Democrats as well as Republicans are doing the wrong thing for political reasons. She says the only correct path is tolling all vehicles as a way to cover a gap in bridge and highway costs that will reach at least 300 million by 2023, and probably twice that much. The tolling plan for trucks would raise between 150 million and 190 million a year. Democrats might want the early vote in part to create as much space as possible between it and the November election, and in part to get this whole, ugly tolls debate off the table before the February start of the three month General Assembly session. They also vow to bake into the bill a promise that contrary to universal Republican accusations this is not the first step in a bait and switch plan to toll all cars on all interstate highways. That, too, rankles Bergstein. I am not endorsing a statement that says we will never toll other vehicles, she said. Our word has to be worth something and I will not be disingenuous. I have always advocated for tolling of all vehicles. It s the only responsible choice and I will not endorse any statement to the contrary. She s right. It is the only responsible choice, especially as the trucking industry challenges trucks only tolling. The good news for in state trucking is that only the largest rigs will face a gantry levy, not the delivery vans, oil trucks or even those 2 axle, 24 foot box trucks that carry, say, furniture from Bob s. Lamont knows she s right and he pushed for full tolling but couldn t make it happen. Here s a solution: Forget the promise of never tolling cars, and build into the bill that any expansion of tolling must be accompanied by an equal, balanced tax cut someplace else. That means, for example, if we tack on a fee for cars and general trucks at those same gantries, we create a new income tax credit (good idea) or we cut the gasoline tax (bad idea). That one for one trade off would yield a bonus of 40 percent, the amount of tolls that would come from out of state drivers using our roads. It s like a company match in your 401(k). Take it! Sen. Bob Duff, D Norwalk, the majority leader, likes the idea of eliminating the local property tax on cars, which he says punishes city residents. Would he pair that with an expansion of tolls? He wouldn t bite on that, saying only, Well, I d like to end the car tax. Bergstein exited the Senate caucus a couple of hours early on Tuesday afternoon. Did she storm out? No, she and at least one person in the room at the state Capitol said. I had heard everything I needed to hear, I said what I needed to say. I wasn t angry, she insisted. She s not angry at her fellow lawmakers, that is. On an individual basis, I have profound respect for all of my colleagues in the legislature. No, she s unhappy over the process that led to a watered down tolling bill when a truly meaningful one was in reach. If elected officials don t have the courage to stand up for what they know to be in the best interests of the people in the state then they shouldn t run for office, she said. The culture of bullying in Connecticut by a few people apparently has intimated some of our elected officials into shying away. One little issue is that there s no final bill yet. Details, details. The 12 gantries on the target list same as the 14 Lamont proposed in November, minus the Merritt Parkway, which has no trucks, and Route 9 in Middletown could still change. And as one person pointed out, it doesn t make sense to name each tolling location in statute. Trucks would pay between 6 and 13 at each location significantly higher than the fees trucks faced in rhe previous plan and that s bound to help the interstate truckers legal case that they re being unfairly targeted. Yes, the controversial I 684 location that s basically in New York state is on the list, for now. The bigger issue, Bergstein said, correctly, is that we still face limited options: Tax more every year to pay for transportation upgrades borrow more, which will lead to much higher costs in the long run neglect the infrastructure and fall behind further as a state and expand tolling to the people who use the highways. Most lawmakers who supported full tolling, and still want it, are lined up behind this flawed bargain. Political reality being what it is, the proposal currently on the table is a reasonable compromise addressing some of the most pressing needs at this time and I hope we can move expeditiously to get it passed, said Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D Bridgeport, a strong tolls supporter. Bergstein, whose tolling plan included an infrastructure bank that would bring significant financial advantages and federal dollars, said she s sensitive to the rising cost of living in Connecticut. We need to invest so that there is less pressure to tax, she said. dhaar hearstmediact. com Car Engulfed In Flames Closes Merritt Parkway The fire occurred around noon between Exits 42 and 44 on the northbound side of the road, according to Fairfield Fire Department Deputy Chief Kyran Dunn, who said Westport firefighters arrived on scene first and extinguished the blaze. The car was engulfed in flames, a Westport Fire Department news release said, and the parkway was completely shut down for about 20 minutes. No one was injured, according to the news release. The area was clear by 1:15 p. m. , according to the Twitter account for Connecticut Department of Transportation District 3.  On the Market: Raised ranch along Lee Pond in Westport WESTPORT Winter has been relatively kind to the region so far. Snowfall hasn t amounted to much, and temperatures have seesawed from seasonally appropriate to unseasonably warm. Still, many people are anxiously awaiting the arrival of spring, particularly those who live along Lee Pond, where residents can row boat, canoe, kayak, paddleboard and enjoy bird watching. There is a chance to live within this water community by purchasing the cream colored raised ranch at 11 Stone Drive. The listing agent calls it the perfect home in a great location at the right price. It s a wonderful neighborhood and is convenient because of its nearness to town and all of Westport s amenities, including the Metro North train station, shopping, restaurants and local beaches, according to the agent. The house is only about one mile from downtown. A mile away in the opposite direction is the entrance to the Merritt Parkway. This six room, 2,016 square foot house has picture postcard curb appeal, the agent said. It sits at the end of a private cul de sac off Calumet Road on a level and sloping 0.75 acre property. Views of Lee Pond are visible from the living room, dining room and kitchen. It was built in 1964 and has since received many improvements. It has a newer roof, mechanicals and air conditioning system. Even with its many updates, the kitchen and baths could use some TLC. The driveway is lined with fieldstone retaining walls, concluding in front of the attached underhouse two car garage. One side of the driveway is planted with a row of attractive perennials. The windows on the front facade are punctuated with window boxes. The blue front door stands out against the light colored exterior. This door is framed by sidelights and topped with a tall multipaned transom. On the main living level, the open floor plan allows for an ease of flow from one room to the next for everyday living and entertaining. There are no walls between the living and dining rooms. One is completely open to the other. The living room has a built in bookshelf, and the dining room has a window seat and a door to the large raised wood deck that has multiple tiers. The kitchen features open faced cabinets and stainless steel appliances. There are three bedrooms in this house, all on the main level. The master suite has a private bath. The lower level features wood paneled walls and a floor to ceiling antiqued red brick fireplace with a raised hearth. The large open space serves as a family room and enough space to include a gym, play room, music room or home office.

(contributed photo) Stamford, CT On January 16, the Stamford Museum Nature Center welcomed more than 250 guests of all ages to meet prolific American nature photographer and conservationist, Thomas D. Mangelsen, at the opening reception Thomas D. Mangelsen A Life in the Wild. Produced by David J. Wagner, LLC, the exhibition features 40 arresting photographs from a body of work amassed over four decades traveling to the wildest corners of North America, Africa and beyond. Thomas D. Mangelsen: A Life in the Wild will be on view in the Stamford Museum s Bendel Galleries through March 15, 2020. Gallery hours are Monday through Friday from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. , and 11 a. m. to 5 p. m. on Sundays. Mangelsen has become legendary for a body of work that includes some of the most recognizable landscape and wildlife scenes ever photographed. Recently featured in an in depth interview on CBS s 60 Minutes, he has been praised by many as a spiritual descendant of Ansel Adams, Eliot Porter, and Edward Weston. Each image in Mangelsen s portfolio has been taken in the wild under natural conditions the result of waiting for the picture perfect moment across decades, and often in hostile conditions, said Jillian Casey, Curator of Collections Exhibitions for the Stamford Museum Nature Center. Such a body of work can only be achieved by having a heightened sense of animal behavior, an uncanny ability to read the environment, and work with such patience.

Ferries on Long Island Sound Just Don't Work for Commuting : Cameron on Transportation - Darienite Just when I thought Gov. Ned Lamont was getting it together to launch a thoughtful, considered take two on his transportation vision, bam along comes another nonsensical idea. Jim Cameron It wasn t enough that he tried to sell us on the zany, physically/fiscally impossible 30 30 30 vision of faster train speeds, now he is (literally) refloating the idea of high speed ferry service from Bridgeport and Stamford to New York City. Such ferry service wouldn t take cars off of Interstate 95. Those drivers aren t going where the ferry does. And if they haven t already opted for the train, why would they ever take a ferry? The lure of federal funding is driving the Lamont team to revisit the often studied, always rejected, idea of aquatic commutation. Since 2006, I have written about why ferries will never work here. But let me remind you of the high points: High speed ferries are not fast. They can only go 29 mph in open waters, half the speed of a Metro North train. Speeds in excess of 30 mph mean higher operating costs for additional highly skilled crew. They only carry 149 passengers compared to 1,000 on a train and are gas guzzling polluters (vs. clean electric trains). A fleet of two such ferries might make two round trips a day (vs. every 20 minutes for rush hour trains). They can t operate in all weather. The fares would be at least double those of the train and they d still need huge subsidies to attract operators. New York state and federal subsidies of 4.7 million were wasted on a ferry from Yonkers to New York City, which ran for four years. At its peak, it carried just 90 passengers a day, paying 8 each way subsidized at 50 per ride. Or consider Glen Cove s experience with failed ferries on Long Island. In 2001, that bedroom community just 28 miles from New York City on the Long Island Railroad, began ferry service to the city at fares pretty close to those charged on the train. It failed after a year due to low ridership even though it received a 1 million subsidy from the MTA. In the summer of hell in 2017 when track work at Penn Station delayed trains, the service resumed with two boats each rush hour carrying a total of fewer than 80 passengers. The subsidies for the July to September runs totaled more than 1.5 million. That s a 257 subsidy per passenger per trip. In 2016, Glen Cove used a federal grant to build a 16.6 million stylish new ferry terminal and dock. But aside from the summer of 2017, the city has been unable to find a ferry operator to resume service. So guess what: the feds asked for their money back. Glen Cove had until last January to resume ferry service or refund Washington its money. After an extension, the city council voted 4 3 to hire a new, heavily subsidized ferry operator not because they liked the proposal, but because the alternative of paying back 16 million was even worse. So if the Lamont transportation team is so excited about using federal money to study, build or even start a private public partnership for ferry service from Connecticut, they should consider the consequences. Federal money may seem free, but if it locks you into a money losing, heavily subsidized, under utilized fast ferry for Fat Cats going to Wall Street, the long term cost could be huge.

Here's When Storm System Will Bring Mix Of Snow, Ice, Rain To Region A storm system that will bring a mix of snow, ice and rain to the region will follow a return to more seasonable temperatures. Milder air arrives on Thursday, Jan. 23, which will be mostly cloudy with a high temperature in the mid 40s and wind chill values between 25 and 35 degrees. Friday, Jan. 24 will be partly sunny with a high temperature in the low to mid 40s. Then comes the chance for a wintry mix and snow farther inland as the overnight low falls to at or below the freezing mark in areas north of I 287 in New York and the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut. (See first image above. ) Precipitation should arrive after 3 a. m. Saturday, Jan. 25 as rain with some sleet mixed in for New York City, Long Island, southern Westchester and coastal Connecticut. In the areas farther north, a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain will continue until around 10 a. m. Accumulation of about a half inch of snow and sleet is possible. The entire region will see rain at times during the day and evening on Saturday. Saturday's high temperature in the upper 30s inland to the low 40s farthest south under mostly cloudy skies. There will be another chance for a wintry mix and snow overnight Saturday into Sunday, Jan. 26, again in areas north and inland. Sunday will be another mostly cloudy day with the high temperatures around 40 degrees. There will be a chance of rain from 9 a. m. Sunday through the rest of the morning. Skies will become partly sunny in the afternoon. Monday, Jan. 27 will be mostly sunny with the high temperature around 40 degrees. Check back to Daily Voice for updates.

Selectmen: More Information Needed on Scenic Road Proposal for Binney Park On Thursday about two dozen residents turned out to support the idea of a proposed Scenic Road designation for a .6 mile loop in Old Greenwich, around the northern part of Binney Park. Candace Garthwaite, who has spearheaded the effort along with Rita Baker, noted that one of the Town s POCD s objectives is to encourage the designation of more scenic roads in town. She noted that the idea was suggested in the first place by P Z back in 2018 when DPW proposed a large rotary by the Perrot Library. At the time, neighbors came out in force to oppose the rotary. It was suggested that if there was a Scenic Road designation that might have protected the existing, smaller rotary that residents are so fond of. Since the Scenic Road ordinance was adopted in 1992, five local roads have received the designation: Cliffdale Road, Burying Hill Road, Selden Lane, Buckfield Lane, and Sawmill Lane. This proposed Scenic Road in Old Greenwich would be the Town s first south of the Merritt Parkway. Garthwaite noted that might set an encouraging precedent for Scenic Roads around other parks in the future. If we achieve the scenic road designation, it could have an impact on other important and beautiful roads such as the roadway around and through Bruce Park, Garthwaite said. The Town Charter s preamble states: Scenic Roads are irreplaceable resources, the destruction of which has had and will have an adverse impact on the town s historic and scenic heritage. A Scenic Road application requires endorsement by owners of a majority of property that abuts this proposed scenic loop, and Garthwaite said that all of them gave written approvals except two who rent their properties. They also received signed written approval from the Perrot Library and the First Congregational Church. We just need your help, Garthwaite said of the requirement of the Selectmen s blessing to go ahead and submit the application. Nancy Chapin who is a member of the Binney Park Advisory committee asked how the Scenic Road might impact her committee s ability to do work including planting trees. Garthwaite said while a Historic District designation has an impact on homeowners, a Scenic Road designation does not impact a neighboring property whatsoever. Owners of properties on scenic roads preserve their property rights, including the town, she said. Garthwaite said P Z that has the authority to designate scenic roads, but in order to get the proposal before them, the Selectmen would need to put the item on the RTM Call to seek their approval, which would allow Garthwaite s group to pay the 1,200 application fee and submit the application to P Z. If approved by the Planning Zoning Commission, the Scenic Road would then have to be approved by the RTM. It s fine to preserve architecture, but it s also important to preserve settings. Paul Pugliese, Greenwich Preservation Trust Paul Pugliesi founding member of the Greenwich Preservation Trust and 30 year member of the town s Architectural Review Committee (ARC), said the previous night ARC had agreed that town character and preservation of history are reflected not just in buildings, but in scenic landscape. We want it to move forward in a public forum so that we can all discuss this and add a little bit of protection, Pugliese said. It doesn t mean we can t make traffic and safety improvements. It s almost like a historic designation. So often when I go to the Perrot Library to drop off or pick up a book, I have to stop on the Perrot steps and admire the unique view of Binney Park the glistening water, the arched stone bridges, and elegant trees and lawn. It truly is a treasure and right across the street is the First Congregation Church established in 1665. Candace Garthwaite Garthwaite said she had hoped the application could be placed on the March RTM Call. Unfortunately, First Selectman Camillo said one of the town attorneys had advised holding off due to concerns. Nothing is as easy as it seems, Camillo said. It seems DPW had an issue. Zoning has had an issue with this designation, and attorney Wetmore from the Law Dept weighed in regarding the intense vehicular component of this . Three different entities had serious concerns about it. Garthwaite said the real discussions around pros and cons should take place in front of P Z. We re asking for transparency, she said. Dept of Public Works deputy commissioner Jim Michel refuted any implication of lack of transparency. He said most DPW projects are subject to public hearings, and any major redesign of a roadway goes before P Z. There are checks and balances in place. We try not to work our projects in this cloud of secrecy. DPW Deputy Commissioner James Michel Allan Lovejoy said, We re asking you to ask the RTM for permission to sign as an abutter and then let the P Z do its job. The RTM has to approve for Fred to sign. Since Binney Park is the majority abutter, Garthwaite said there is a need for the Selectmen to sign on behalf of the town. We need the town s signature in addition to the church, library and 13 neighbors that all signed, she said. Selectperson Jill Oberlander said she was generally sympathetic to the request, and the mission of protecting scenic beauty, but that the board was newly formed and should take time to gather pros and cons and consider unintended consequences. I don t have enough information to vote on it, she said. Oberlander tied the Scenic Road conversation in with the approval earlier in the meeting of a Parks Rec fee hike for the banner across the top of Greenwich Avenue. She said she hoped for a townwide discussion on a commercial advertising policy, particularly the advertising along Greenwich Avenue, and what it does to the character of Greenwich s civic beauty. I encourage you to all come out when we weigh in on townwide advertising, and commercial advertising policy and what it does to the character of our communities. Selectperson Jill Oberlander In the end, the board declined to move the request along, for now. It wasn t a no, Camillo said. I give you my word we will follow up with (town attorney) and Katie (DeLuca, P Z director), and work with Dept of Public works. We re fundamentally with you on this. Camillo said the proposal would likely it will be back on the agenda at the next Board of Selectmen meeting, and rather than have it on the RTM Call for March, it might not be until April. Connecticut s General Statutes Scenic Roads section says, Any town, city or borough may, by ordinance, designate highways or portions of highways as scenic roads. Greenwich s Municipal code Chapter 11, article 3 preamble talks about the value of Scenic Roads. Scenic roads are irreplaceable resources, the destruction of which has had and will have an adverse impact on the town s historic and scenic heritage. The purpose of this Article is to establish standards and procedures for designating town highways 1 or portions thereof as scenic roads and for regulating and preserving the town s scenic roads for the benefit of present and future generations.

Op-Ed: Floren On The 'Honor of a Lifetime' Politics Government Op Ed: Floren On The 'Honor of a Lifetime' """"Greenwich has been my home for nearly fifty years"," and it gives me great pleasure knowing I was able to give back to my community. """" Reply Livvy Floren submitted an op ed on Jan. 5", 2021. (Shutterstock) The following op ed was submitted by Livvy Floren on Jan. 5, 2021: The Honor of a Lifetime After twenty unforgettable years serving the 149th Connecticut House District, it is time for me to say goodbye to a job I truly love, and colleagues I will dearly miss, but in the words of one of my favorite philosophers, Winnie the Pooh," """"How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard. """" From my early years in local politics as a member of the Representative Town Meeting and the Board of Estimate and Taxation", to my latest roles as Assistant House Republican Leader and Ranking Member of the Bonding Subcommittee, it has been quite a journey. In my two decades in office, I have served with four Governors, five Speakers of the House, three Minority Leaders, four Greenwich First Selectmen, and three Stamford Mayors, and have logged 174,000 miles on the Merritt Parkway. During that same time span, Doug and I celebrated our fifty third wedding anniversary, the marriage of all four of our children, and the birth of ten grandchildren. As I look back on my time in Hartford, I am grateful for the friends I have made and for the important work we have done together. For starters, I am pleased with the work we have done to advance women's issues, especially our bipartisan efforts on reproductive rights and the expansion of healthcare coverage to include essential benefits for women, children, and adolescents. We've also come together as a legislature to address sexual assault and harassment, pay inequality, and domestic violence. I was proud to cosponsor these initiatives and to see these bills prevail in the House and Senate. I also consider our joint conservation efforts to be landmark accomplishments. We have taken many steps to protect our water supply, air quality, forests, and open spaces because we recognized the need and urgency to preserve our natural resources for our children and grandchildren. Speaking of young people, we have made great strides in advancing educational and professional opportunities by investing in local schools, including Wright Tech and UConn Stamford, and have championed local businesses that hire from within the community. I have always fought to make Connecticut more welcoming and more competitive for employers because when they succeed, our economy succeeds. And that brings me to my role in the budgeting process, and the important work we've done to keep our state's finances in order. Balancing the state budget is never easy and difficult choices are required," but we must always remember to live within our means and to put real needs before """"nice to haves. """" Over the years", we have kept important state programs and initiatives funded, but we must continue to reevaluate our spending to ensure viability, efficiency, and sustainability in everything we do. It is also important to remember that Connecticut is an expensive place to live, work, and raise a family, which is why I always fought for tax reform. One of our greatest accomplishments in this area was a Republican initiative to expand the income tax exemption for pension, Social Security, and annuity earnings to more individuals. Our seniors deserve to retire in this state with dignity and financial security, and I hope future legislatures will keep this in mind because at the end of the day, it is their constituents' tax money, and it should be collected and spent wisely. It is never easy representing so many individuals with vastly different experiences and ideas, but every speech I delivered and each vote I cast on the House floor was made with my entire constituency in mind. I have always tried my best to represent you equally because you deserve no less. Greenwich has been my home for nearly fifty years, and it gives me great pleasure knowing I was able to give back to my community, as well as our neighbor, the City of Stamford. I've had the privilege of working with remarkable local leaders, both past and present, who have been exemplary role models that work tirelessly on behalf of our residents. I thank them for their friendship and for being outstanding partners in our common goal of bettering Greenwich and Stamford. I am also thankful for my family's love, support, and encouragement, especially during those late session nights. Doug, our children, and grandchildren have always been a source of inspiration throughout my career in public service, and now, I look forward to spending more time with them. To my colleagues in Hartford, I thank them for the wonderful memories. Whether they served on the left or right side of the aisle, they always advocated in the best interest their constituents, and we learned much from one another. I was fortunate to have served with them, and I wish those also retiring the very best as they begin a new chapter in their lives. Their communities were fortunate to have them at their service. Finally, I would like to thank you, my friends across the 149th District who have placed your trust in me year after year, for the honor of a lifetime. It has been the highlight of my professional life to serve each of you, and I wish our incoming State Representative Kimberly Fiorello, and the entire 2021 2022 General Assembly," all the best in the upcoming session.

Year in review: Coronavirus, Dulos, protests, shootings dominated Stamford news STAMFORD A landmark presidential election and yet another reckoning with the country s racial history notwithstanding, 2020 will first and foremost be known as the year of the COVID 19 pandemic. In Connecticut, that was as true for Stamford as anywhere. For part of the spring, Stamford was the epicenter of the disease in the state, seeing more new cases per day than any other municipality. In April, the Connecticut National Guard and U. S. Army Reserve arrived in the city to help with the caseload at Stamford Hospital and repurpose a building on its grounds to help meet extra demand. Restaurants in the city were shuttered, as were many non essential businesses. In an effort to help local eateries, an outdoor dining campaign called Streateries was launched by the Downtown Special Services District over the summer. The city budget was also slashed by 32 million due to the economic effects of the virus. That included about 12 million from the schools budget. Stamford schools shifted to a full remote learning model in March, and returned to partial in school teaching in September. As cases of COVID 19 started to rise again after Thanksgiving, the district decided to go back to full distance learning until Jan. 19. As 2021 begins, vaccine distribution promises to be the story of the year. In Connecticut, the rate of vaccination so far has outpaced New York, but the disease s positivity rate remains high. Dulos saga The year began with new developments in what had been one of the biggest local and state stories of 2019. In January, Farmington resident Fotis Dulos was charged with the murder of his wife Jennifer who was reported missing to New Canaan police where she lived with the couple s five children on May 24, 2019. A few weeks after the arrest, the 52 year old Dulos was found unresponsive in a vehicle in the garage of his home. He was flown to New York in critical condition, and put on life support while suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. Fotis Dulos died on Thursday, Jan. 30. Jennifer Dulos body has yet to be recovered. Michelle Troconis, ex girlfriend of Fotis Dulos, and Kent Mawhinney, his former attorney, have pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Their cases remain ongoing. Racial justice protests This summer was marked by protests against police brutality in cities across the nation. Again, Stamford was among them. Nationwide, protests erupted after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis in May. In Stamford, a number of demonstrations, under the banner of Black Lives Matter and others, took place. In July, a contingent of demonstrators calling themselves Justice for Steven Barrier set up an encampment in Latham Park to protest the death of the Stamford resident, who died in police custody in October of 2019. Some of the people involved in that effort also took part in a campaign to remove a statue of Christopher Columbus from Stamford s downtown Columbus Park. Police eventually ordered protesters to leave Latham Park or be arrested. The Columbus debate, which resulted in dueling rallies, has since quieted down, as city officials stated they would wait until 2021 to address it. But tension between the Latham Park activists and police reached a boiling point in August, when a long protest led to altercations on Broad Street. An internal affairs investigation was completed and the results are to be presented to the Stamford Police Commission at its next meeting scheduled for Jan. 4. Shootings on the rise Stamford has garnered a reputation for being one of the safest cities in America in recent years, but 2020 saw many shootings reported across the city. The increase in gun violence led to a rally in December, with community leaders speaking out against the spate of shootings, many of which are believed to be the result of hostilities between neighborhood factions in the city. Several people have been shot. And on Sept. 20, Shernetta Dunmore, a Stamford mother, was shot and killed when a gunman or gunmen fired on people gathered in a parking lot on Ursula Place. Two others were wounded in the shooting. Police days later arrested Ian Evans in relation to one of the men wounded at the party. He was charged with first degree assault, criminal use of a firearm and other offenses. To date no arrest has been made in Dunmore s death. In early December, a Stamford Hospital worker was shot while driving home from work after he was struck by a stray bullet from a shootout on West Broad Street. The 56 year old hospital employee was admitted to the hospital but his wound was not life threatening. Police have made an arrest in relation to that incident. Gunfire has occurred in various parts of the city, from Connecticut Avenue on the West Side to Pequot Drive in Waterside and Lockwood Avenue on the East Side to Hope Street in Glenbrook. In November, two shootings in neighborhoods near Westover Magnet Elementary School terrified parents, staff and students, causing lockdowns at the school and leading to a virtual meeting hosted by the school principal and police department staff. Police officers implored residents to quickly report any acts of violence to help get guns off the streets. The Gun and Crime Stoppers program allows people to report crimes anonymously, and offers rewards for tips that lead to arrests. The hotline can be reached at 203 977 TIPS. People can also text the keyword Tips2SPD and a tip to CRIMES (274 637), or go to www. StamfordPD. org/Tips. School closes Enrollment and deficit problems led to the closure of the 60 year old Trinity Catholic High School this year. By February, school officials received word that only 19 freshman students had committed to the school for the 2020 21 school year, well below expectations. Projected enrollment for next year was up to 110 students, while enrollment for the 2018 19 school year was 295 students. Closing Trinity broke my heart, said Bishop Frank J. Caggiano. In the past, the diocese had to pick up the cost of operation, mostly payroll and healthcare expenses. This year s budget deficit was expected to be 1.3 million, and would have catapulted to 2.3 million next year based on the reduced enrollment of roughly 100 students. The building, however, won t be vacant for long. In November, Mater Salvatoris, operated by the Spain based Sisters of the Company of the Savior, purchased the property, and will begin teaching there in September. Currently, Mater Salvatoris operates an all girls college preparatory school of about 49 students from pre K to fourth grade in a building on Scofieldtown Road. It opened in 2018 and is one of only seven schools in the world founded by the Sisters of the Company of the Savior, and the only one in the continental United States. ignacio. laguarda stamfordadvocate. com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wormtown Brewery,"Greater Good brews latest batch of Worcester's Bravest Staff Writer Telegram Gazette WORCESTER The latest batch of Worcester's Bravest, a beer honoring Worcester firefighters, entered the brewing stage Monday at Greater Good Imperial Brewing Co. The beer will honor Fire Lt. Jason Menard, who died in a house fire Nov. 13. Wormtown Brewery, Wachusett Brewing Co. and Greater Good Imperial Brewing Co. are brewing Worcester s Bravest to raise money for Menard s wife, Tina, and his three children. They will donate all of the proceeds to the Menard Children s Fund, established by the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts and International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1009. The breweries will host release events: Wormtown on Jan. 24, Wachusett on Jan. 25 and Greater Good on Jan. 31.  Wormtown Brewery plans larger taproom next door, add distillery Matthew Tota Correspondent When Wormtown Brewery s Shrewsbury Street taproom opened on St. Patrick s Day 2015, it carried an aura of coolness and originality that captured the essence the city s first brewery in decades. Sure, the taproom was small but by design. Examining an early drawing of the taproom two years earlier, co founder Ben Roesch and managing partner David Fields had deemed it too large, taking away valuable space for brewing and bottling. We both looked at each other and said, What is that? We don t need that much space for our taproom. We need production space, Fields has said. And we had them shrink our taproom by at least 50 percent, maybe more. It was a decision their future selves having seen how taprooms have transformed the craft beer business would have no doubt vetoed. And while the move in no way hindered Wormtown s rise, Roesch and Fields still regret downplaying the importance of their taproom. Over the past several months, though, they have quietly pushed to rewrite history. And Wormtown is taking over an additional 5,000 square feet of its building to build a new taproom and restaurant. Wormtown has moved into the section of 72 Shrewsbury St. formerly occupied by simjang, the America Korean fusion restaurant. The brewery has a final hearing next month with the city to extend its licenses to cover the new taproom. The space, more than double the size of the brewery s current taproom, comes with a full kitchen and two levels for dining and drinking. We had recognized at Wormtown, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, that, while this was a state of the art taproom six years ago, first of its kind in Worcester County, it needed a facelift, Fields said. Wormtown had been eyeing simjang s space for more than a year. And the chaos created by COVID 19 only reinforced the need to move to a larger taproom. We really realized by the end of the summer, when outdoor dining went away, we had to do something to allow for a bigger, more social distancing friendly space for our guests, Fields said. The taproom s size is hardly what makes it special, however. Wormtown intends to use it to debut a new venture: distilling. The brewery has already applied for a federal license to become a distillery, a process that will take between four to six months. We will be approaching the city of Worcester with the hope of becoming Worcester s first distillery, much like we were Worcester s first brewery, in generations, Fields said. Once it receives its federal license, along with approval from the city, Wormtown hopes to begin making its own line of spirits, offering them first as cocktails in the new taproom. The consumers will ultimately determine how it evolves, Fields said. Really, what we want to do is drink stuff that we make ourselves. We always start by fulfilling our own desires, making and drinking some cool stuff. Our team loves spirits, especially bourbons and whiskeys. Wormtown also expects to use the taproom s kitchen to host pop ups. Fields said a few local restaurants are already excited about the opportunity, especially given the struggles they re facing now with COVID 19.

Kerrytown District,"Treasure Mart, an Ann Arbor staple for 60 years, is up for sale Amid a time of widespread change in Michigan's best known college town, Ann Arbor's staple consignment store, Treasure Mart, has gone up for sale. Treasure Mart is a family owned store that focuses on the trade of small antique items and furniture. It sits on Detroit Street at the heart of the Kerrytown District in Ann Arbor, an area known for its year round farmer's market and eclectic retail shops. The owner, Elaine Johns, announced the news Tuesday via a Facebook post that featured two photos of the blue, mid 19th century building that houses her business. Yesterday was a really, really hard day for me (for us), she wrote. I got up and immediately started sobbing uncontrollably because we had to list Treasure Mart and the property for sale due to my health issues. Johns, who has managed the store since 1995, was diagnosed with ALS in November and realized she wouldn t be able to work for much longer. She and her husband, Carl Johns, decided to put Treasure Mart up for sale to focus on tending for her health. It s not gonna be long before Elaine can t work anymore and her health is going to dictate that, Carl said. If she hadn t gotten sick, we might ve been here another five or six years, but at some point, things have to change. The area has changed much in the 60 years since Elaine's mother, Demaris Cash, opened the store to keep her family afloat following her husband's two heart attacks and her older daughter's diagnosis with muscular dystrophy. According to Carl Johns, friends told Cash that nobody would go to a store in that area, but Treasure Mart has become a fundamental and constant presence for the Kerrytown community. Martha Woolson is a current on call employee of Treasure Mart and has been going to the store since she was a child. She compared its possible demise to that of Detroit's J. L Hudson's. When they tore down Hudson s, it was as if they took the heart out of Detroit,"" she said. ""I am not saying that Treasure Mart will take the heart out of Ann Arbor, but it s not just a brick but more like a little something being taken out. It is going to be a fine city, but it won t be the same city. The Johnses understand how important their store is for the community and are intent on selling Treasure Mart to someone who will respect it. We are hopeful that we will find that person,"" Carl Johns said. ""Unfortunately, the property in Kerrytown right now is worth a whole lot more than businesses. I would hate to see it go away because so many of the older businesses around town are vanishing right now. "" He said a few individuals have expressed interest in acquiring the property and business, but there have not been any formal offers yet. Despite Treasure Mart being one of the few stores of its kind left in Ann Arbor, a common thread ties its story, not only to Hudson's but also to those of other locally owned retail stores in the Kerrytown District. The owner of Motte Bailey Booksellers in Kerrytown, Gene Alloway, also expressed concern because of a trend he has observed in the last few years: local stores closing and paving the way for chain stores and upscale restaurants to take their place. A lot of people sell online. Instead of taking to consignment shops like Treasure Mart, they put it on Craigslist or eBay, Amazon even,"" Alloway said. ""It s just not enough to open your door and have good stuff anymore. More:New express bus will run from Detroit to Ann Arbor More:Horizon Books, a cherished Traverse City bookstore, to close after 58 years Woolson also fears losing individuality and character in the community. She claims the city has been gradually filled with modern and plastic ""stuff. "" But preservation is still of utmost importance for the Johnses, who hope to keep their businesses afloat at all costs. I would hope people don t get the idea that we are gonna close the doors and not be open anymore because that is just not in the cards right now, said Carl. We plan on being open through this whole process.

Michigan Science Center,"Detroit RoboCop statue's final form to be 'unveiled later this winter' Detroit Almost a decade after the idea turned into a reality, the statue of Detroit's favorite science fiction legend, RoboCop, appears to be nearing final assembly ahead of a debut at the Michigan Science Center. On Tuesday, organizers of the Kickstarter campaign website who crowdfunded the larger than life sized RoboCop for the city posted a few teaser photos of the statue with a note that its final form is coming ""later this winter. "" ""With his head on, he is 11 tall,"" organizers wrote in the update. ""The stainless steel base he is on weighs half a ton by itself. He is big, he is clean, he is bronze, he is perfect. "" RoboCop is the star of a 1987 film that is set in Detroit. The film spawned a television series, a video game, comic book and more. The genesis of the RoboCop statue for Detroit began in 2011 with a single tweet. A man sent a tweet to then Mayor Dave Bing who noted that Philadelphia has a statue of Rocky and RoboCop would be a ""GREAT ambassador for Detroit. Bing tweeted back, saying there were no plans in Detroit for a statue of RoboCop. But Detroiters Brandon Walley, a filmmaker, and Jerry Paffendorf, co founder and CEO at Loveland Technologies, ran with the idea, envisioning it as a tourist attraction. A Kickstarter campaign launched in 2012 raised 67,436 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide. Since then, Giorgio Gikas, one of Detroit s premier sculptor conservators, has been creating the sculpture. While the statue was expected to be unveiled last summer, organizers instead announced RoboCop's home would be at the Michigan Science Center, instead of the previously announced location at Wayne State University's TechTown urban research and technology business park. This week, organizers say the next time RoboCop is seen, he will have a dark gray patina. ""This is as much detail as we can share for now as control of the statue is being fully handed off,"" organizers wrote. ""We re working hard to help get him outdoors and installed so you can finally pay him a visit. ""You will find that the scale and quality of craftsmanship were worth the wait.

Detroit’s giant RoboCop statue almost finished after nearly 10 years: Where it will be displayed DETROIT Detroit will soon have its long awaited RoboCop statue on display in the city. After nearly 10 years in the making, the giant bronze statue depicting the cyborg law enforcer from the 1987 movie, who patrolled the streets of Detroit in the near future, is nearly complete. Organizers, who started the Kickstarter campaign in 2011, tell MLive the statue should be done by the end of March. Once it s complete, the statue will be put on display outside the Michigan Science Center on John R St. most likely sometime this spring. We wanted the statue to be outside on the grounds of the Science Center where people didn t have to pay money to go into the museum to see it, said Brandon Walley, one of the people behind the project. We wanted people to be able to see it anytime just by walking. Walley says the Science Center hasn t picked a spot yet where it will be displayed, but a huge ceremony is expected to take place. He says there s a good chance actor Peter Weller, who played RoboCop, will be there. Weller and the original director have expressed interest over the years in coming to the unveiling, but there s no guarantee. We have built up a relationship with Weller. We met him at a local comic con a few years ago and got to know him. He s fascinated with Detroit and the city s architecture. Once the head is on, the statue will be 11 feet tall. It has a stainless steel base and weighs a whopping half a ton. Venus Bronze Works of Detroit is a big part of the project. Walley says it was important that as much of the statue was built in Detroit as possible. He says a lot of the Kickstarter money went into giving the restoration company the tools they needed. This could have been finished sooner with other institutions, but we wanted this done in Detroit. Finding Venus Bronze Works, one of the top bronze statue restoration companies in the world was big. They do the Joe Louis fist, the Spirit of Detroit statue. We outfitted them with the capabilities of being a foundry. They weren t really built out for a project of this size. But having a Detroit artist making it in Detroit was really important to us. How the project happened: About 10 years ago, someone on Twitter pointed out that Philadelphia had a statue of Rocky and that one of RoboCop would be a great ambassador for Detroit. The Twitter user tagged then Mayor Dave Bing who tweeted back saying there were no plans for a RoboCop statue. That s when Walley, a filmmaker, and Jerry Paffendorf, co founder and CEO of Loveland Technologies went with the idea and created a Kickstarter campaign which raised more than 67,000 with nearly 3,000 worldwide backers. It starts with a couple of us having a crazy idea. Then people from all over the world pitched in. We had to figure out on the fly how to make this happen as successfully as possible, Walley told MLive. Why so long? We had to contact MGM who owns the likeness of RoboCop, making sure we did everything right through them. It became a really long process. We had to get the exact model made. That model had to be blown up to over a 10 foot mold. That happened in Vancouver, and Idaho. That took years as well. The owner of Venus Bronze Works went through a cancer scare. That was two more years. Our main goal was to get him done right with the exact likeness. We wanted to make sure it was bronze and beautiful. We would have loved for it to have been off of our plate a half decade ago, but we rolled through it and are seeing it through the finish line. Walley says the next time you see the statue, it will be sporting a fully finished dark gray patina.

The work of art that began as an offbeat idea back in 2011 is now almost finished, according to one of the men who launched its crowdfunding campaign. ""The casting is completely done. All that is left is applying the patina and welding the large sections together,"" said Brandon Walley of the Imagination Station via email in a status update on the nine years and counting project. According to Walley, the crew at Detroit's Venus Bronze Works should have the statue finished and ready to leave the shop by March. ""We do need to wait until the freeze of winter is over and the ground to thaw to be able to install outside,"" he said. Recent photos were posted in late December on the project's Kickstarter page by Imagination Station, a community arts nonprofit group based in Corktown. They reveal that once RoboCop's head is welded onto his body, the results are going to be pretty amazing not to mention 11 feet tall. ""He is big, he is clean, he is bronze, he is perfect,"" the posting reads. ""The next time you see him he will be sporting a fully finished dark gray patina. "" In the pictures, you can see approximately what that patina will look like in the portion of the breast plate. Walley, a Detroit filmmaker, and Jerry Paffendorf, co founder of Loveland Technologies started the Imagination Station's grassroots effort to raise money for the RoboCop statue in 2011 and ended up with pledges for more than 67,000. The spark for their campaign was a Twitter message sent to Detroit's then mayor Dave Bing. A Massachusetts man suggested to Bing that the half man, half cyborg police officer from the 1987 sci fi cult hit ""RoboCop"" could serve as a Motor City ambassador, much like the statue of Rocky does in Philadelphia. Bing replied that no plans were underway, but the idea spurred much online attention and began a life of its own. Now the light at the end of the tunnel seems to be here for the monument born with a tweet. ""You will find that the scale and quality of craftsmanship were worth the wait,"" teases the December Kickstarter posting. Giorgio Gikas has been overseeing the process at Venus Bronze Works, one of the leading sculptural restoration and conservation businesses in the nation. Gikas, an art conservation expert, has spent decades restoring iconic local works like the Joe Louis fist, the ""Spirit of Detroit statue and more. Before work even could start, however, there were many legal and technical hurdles to overcome, including obtaining copyright permission and navigating the many complicated mold and model making steps in the lead up to the pouring of the casts. In May 2018, Imagination Station announced that the statue would have a home on the grounds of the Michigan Science Center, which then was under the direction of president and CEO Tonya Matthews. The RoboCop statue is expected to be installed somewhere on the site in the spring or summer of 2020, if it is completed in that time frame, according to Christian Greer, the head of the Michigan Science Center since June 2019. From 2017: RoboCop statue's bronze pieces revealed A veteran of Chicago's Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and, most recently, a chief officer of the Saint Louis Science Center, Greer says that he doesn't want to comment on any specifics until the statue actually is finished. Any details also will need to coordinate with the Michigan Science Center's busy planning schedule, notes Greer. Imagination Station is promising to everyone on Kickstarter that the wait will be worth it: ""This is a once in a lifetime work of art, engineering, and persistence. The hours involved have been innumerable, from craftsmen all over the country to being made in Detroit, this has coalesced into something truly great and truly unique.

Detroit's Glorious Robocop Statue, Nearly a Decade in the Making, Is Almost Done Detroit's extremely long delayed bronze statue of RoboCop will be finished in March. We've almost invented actual robot cops in the nine years it's taken to complete the statue. The huge statue was delayed by copyright problems, manufacturing issues, and more. After nine years, Detroit is finally getting that RoboCop statue, dammit. The Detroit Free Press reports that the comically long delayed statue s parts are all fully fabricated, and now they're all just waiting on a final weld and finishing patina. But the statue s journey has been long and arduous. Kickstarter/Imagination Station Detroit In 2011, a Twitter user suggested to Detroit s mayor that RoboCop the superhuman cyborg law enforcer from the Motor City in the film franchise was a great potential mascot for the city of Detroit, much like how Rocky Balboa represents Philadelphia. At the time, Detroit was in the news mostly for its ongoing economic and population crises, which were profoundly worsened by the nationwide recession. So Brandon Walley and Jerry Paffendorf opened a Kickstarter from the now defunct Imagination Station Detroit. In one of the campaign s first updates, they said the official licensed maker of RoboCops for sale, Fred Barton, was going to fabricate the molds used to then cast the statue. Famous last words. In 2012, W e just checked back in with Fred Barton who has assured us that the parts will be ready soon. In 2013, N ow he's headed to Venus Bronze Works in Detroit for casting and manufacturing in bronze. In 2014, they said the statue would be unveiled later that year, and in December 2014, they said the following spring. Finally, in 2018, they said, The first steps took years, and then when the foam parts and armature arrived at the last bronze shop in Detroit it took years more. The Free Press says realities of the manufacturing process, combined with copyright issues did they not have a licensing agreement when they began raising money? should be familiar to anyone who s backed a many times delayed or even canceled Kickstarter campaign. The statue is slated to stand outside the Michigan Science Center, but that institution, too, has changed leadership in the time since it was announced. The new leader told the Free Press that he doesn't want to comment on any specifics until the statue actually is finished. On the Kickstarter campaign s most recent update, one backer wrote in a comment, In this time this project was funded until now . Detroit entered and exited bankruptcy, a NEW Robocop movie was shot, edited and released, and Detroit has flourished and become almost an unrecognizably BETTER city. The statue, now finally nearing completion, is 11 feet tall, with a base that weighs a half ton on its own. The whole RoboCop body is made of bronze and will be finished with dark gray patina that mimics the original RoboCop costumes worn in the movies. Those costumes were made of fiberglass, foam, and plastic , and even so, they weighed at least 50 pounds. Each movie had a new spin on the suit, from different paint colors to better mobility. The patina on the statue will be gray, but the original suits have something in common with naturally occurring patina on bronze. The RoboCop suits are more green than anything when seen in real life, the RoboCop Archive site explains . T hey're painted with a special photoreactive paint that registers metallic on film.

Cass Avenue,"In Michigan, legal age to buy cigarettes, vaping devices is now 21 Michigan 18 year olds can vote, buy rifles or register for the military draft, yet they are now too young to legally buy cigarettes or vaping devices. The federal minimum age for purchasing any tobacco products, including e cigarettes, jumped to 21 on Dec. 20, when President Donald Trump signed a 1.4 trillion spending bill that had the tobacco age restriction tucked into it. The new minimum age took effect immediately, which came as a surprise to many retailers who expected some type of transition period. The timing of the rule change shortly before Christmas was also unexpected. There is still confusion among Michigan officials regarding when the new age restriction will start being enforced. Some stores and gas stations still display signs showing 18 as the age for tobacco products. However, some merchants have gone ahead and raised their minimum purchase age to 21 to avoid any potential trouble with authorities. ""A lot of people are aware of it and angry,"" said Hamze Ezzeddine, a manager at a Shell station on Woodward Avenue in Midtown Detroit that is near Wayne State University. Ezzedine sells a lot of cigarettes and sees many young customers who are students. A spokeswoman for the Michigan Attorney General's Office said Thursday their office is awaiting further guidance about the new regulation from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's tobacco division. The FDA did not respond to a Free Press request for comment, but its website says the law is now in effect. The Michigan Retailers Association has recommended that its members begin following the new federal rule and stop selling tobacco products, including e cigarettes, to those under 21, said Amy Drumm, the association's vice president of government affairs. The association is waiting to learn whether Michigan officials intend to immediately enforce the new rule, Drumm said. ""There is still a lot of confusion,"" she said. A spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health Human Services said that because the new 21 plus federal law is more restrictive than current Michigan law for tobacco sales, no separate amendment or state statute is necessary for enforcement to begin. More:FDA officially raises federal minimum age to purchase all tobacco products from 18 to 21 More:FDA bans mint and fruit flavored vaping products but exempts menthol and tobacco Fruity vape pods ban There are more federal regulations for smokers on the horizon. The FDA said Thursday that it will soon ban fruit and mint flavored pod products used in e cigarettes, while allowing vape shops to still sell flavors from tank based systems, which let people mix their own vaping juice. The pods are considered more convenient. The ban, aimed at curtailing youth vaping, will take effect in 30 days and will not apply to menthol and tobacco flavored products. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned flavored vapes earlier this year but that was put on hold this fall by a court injunction. Bring an ID Nathan Esquivel, owner of the Corktown Smoke Shop in Detroit, said he stopped selling any cigarettes or vaping products to 18 , 19 and 20 year olds as soon as he heard about the new federal 21 plus rule. Now everyone needs to be ID d if they look under 30, he said. Esquivel said his shop doesn't attract many young smokers, so he has not had to turn anyone away. ""They ve all been 21 so far,"" he said. ""I had a person call just to see, and it sounded like he already knew about the law, but he wanted to see if we didn t know about it. He was like Do I need to bring anything?' And we re like, 'An ID. You have to be 21. ' And he s like Oh, really? Esquivel said the coming federal ban on fruity vaping pods will have a bigger impact on his business. Roughly 80% of his vaping sales are for fruit flavored products, he said. Some of the flavors he had on display were frozen mango, pi a colada and cr me br l e. Most of our people are 21 and up, but they still like the fruity vape,"" he said. ""They re going to have to switch over to menthol or tobacco. "" Jamal Saad, manager of the Wayne Party Store on Cass Avenue, directly across from Wayne State, said he anticipates some unhappy customers when students return to campus Monday and discover that he is enforcing the 21 plus rule for vaping products. Most of his student age customers buy vaping products, rather than cigarettes, he said. Wayne State has a ban against any smoking or e cigarette use on campus. ""It s going to affect the business,"" he said. ""This means a person who's 20 now and been smoking for one year, he s going to buy cigarettes he can t.

Downtown Plan Pushed in Darien Politics Government Downtown Plan Pushed in Darien The mayor's proposal would require moving Lace Elementary students to another site. Reply Darien Mayor Joseph Marchese, left, told the City Council this week about a plan to create a downtown on the northwest corner of Cass Avenue and 75th Street. (David Giuliani/Patch) DARIEN A half century ago, residents of four residential subdivisions formed an association that ended up founding Darien. Because of that history, Darien has no downtown. But that is something the mayor and others would like to change. At this week's City Council meeting, Mayor Joseph Marchese talked about preliminary discussions for a proposed development on the northwest corner of Cass Avenue and 75th Street, which he called the geographic center of the town. The 12 acre project would take up the current site of Lace Elementary School, the Old Lace Schoolhouse Museum and Safety Village. The city is now gauging the Darien School District's support. Marchese plans to meet with school officials soon. ""This is something we need to pursue. If it ends with the school district saying they are not interested, then it ends with them,"" Marchese told the council. He said the ideas for the northwest corner of the intersection reflect the city's 2006 comprehensive plan, which guides the city's development long term. Because of that plan, he said, Darien Pointe shopping center was developed some years ago on the southeast corner. The mayor said the northwest corner would promote ""sustainable living"" that could include apartments, condos, retail and parking. ""It could become our downtown area. This won't happen in a month. This is a two to four year project,"" he said. Marchese said the school district would need to find a new site for the students at Lace Elementary, possibly adding on to another school. He said the district's enrollment had dropped to about 1,300 currently, from 2,600 in the early 2000s. The enrollment has dropped, but not quite so much, according to the Illinois Report Card website. Enrollment was 1,463 in 2019, down from 1,795 in 2002, a nearly 20 percent decrease.

Michigan Central Station,"Journey Through Western European Flavors at Cork & Gabel For a moment, let s consider the cultural phenomenon of mozzarella sticks. Fresh mozzarella cheese is rolled in a medley of breadcrumbs spiced with traditional Italian seasoning, deep fried, and served with a side of tangy sweet marinara sauce. Though each ingredient it takes to make a proper serving of mozzarella sticks is a fundamental of Italian cuisine, somehow, the dish with its stretchy cheese proportionately as enamoring for mature adults as it is for wide eyed children has become the archetype of the American appetizer. At Cork Gabel, the mozzarella sticks aren t entirely American or Italian. At Cork Gabel, they re hardly mozzarella sticks at all. Here, the Fried Dubliner Cheese is a starter course ushering diners into the German Irish Italian fusion that s to be expected from all of the dishes to follow. Gooey Dubliner cheese wedges are coated in a crisp herb crust and served atop a smear of marinara sauce and garnished with fresh basil, shaved Parmesan, and a fiery splatter of hot honey. The medley of flavors and techniques is a nod to Executive Chef Matthew McGrail s Italian Irish roots, Owner Joe Mifsud s penchant for German food, and the Corktown restaurant s New American approach to traditional dishes native to each culture. Pi g an Aoire is constructed with all of the ingredients of an authentic Irish Shepherd s Pie a piping hot blend of ground beef and lamb, diced carrots, green peas, rice, cheddar cheese, and silky mashed potatoes but fried crisp into spheres the size of meatballs and plated with a puddle of savory brown gravy. For the Italian Caprese, a fall menu item, wedges of mozzarella are served in rows of three with beautifully charred lines from the griddle, sliced cooked tomatoes, and a ring of balsamic reduction drizzle. Varieties of German sausages show up on the Bangers and Brats portion of the menu. A dish featuring kielbasa and sauerkraut made for a comforting entr e on a cool fall day. The skin on the back of sliced links of kielbasa offers the perfect snap, while the meat itself is tender, with just the right amount of grit that makes a good sausage. Golden sauerkraut peppered with bits of green onion is tangy, complementary to the pile of potato salad served on the side. A heavy hand of vinegar that s steeped into chunks of potato is slightly overpowering, but not enough to stop you from eating every last bite. 1 of 8 The restaurant, originally intended to open as a German style biergarten, has an industrial setting that exudes the feel of a cavernous beer hall. Plates are served to wooden tables with wrought iron details, exposed brick, and vaulted wooden ceilings as the backdrop of your dining experience. The space is unassuming, and a lighthearted energy fills the room. Diners at communal tables are unashamed to eyeball their neighbors dishes or probe for menu recommendations and meal reviews. On one night last spring, the high pitch tone of live Irish bagpipes blared throughout the space, played by a bearded man suited in a proper kilt. On another night, a six piece band tuned up its keyboard and guitars for a lively set that brought diners to their feet for an unexpected night of dinner and dancing. And this past fall, the restaurant was preparing to open an outdoor patio, where guests are welcome to continue the party just steps away from Michigan Central Station. The European fusion crystallizes with Cork Gabel s dessert menu. The Mayflower, the namesake of the restaurant s origin as a doughnut shop founded by German immigrants in the 1940s, is a sweet ode to the venue s historic start. Four warm doughnuts rolled in cinnamon sugar are slid onto the tabletop on a dark wooden plank. Dollops of whipped ricotta cream the most decadent part of the dessert divide the pairs of dense, bite size treats, which are more cake like than a bakery style doughnut hole. But the Irish Waffle Bomb steals the show. A thin, fluffy, rich, boozy Guinness infused chocolate waffle is crowned with one scoop of Baileys Irish Cream ice cream impaled with a shard of chocolate. After the last bite, which comes far too soon, you ll likely be inclined to drag your spoon across the plate, chasing every bit of the chocolate covered pretzel dust that is grated over top of the plate, trapping sweet salty bits in a sticky scrawl of Jameson caramel sauce. And while it may never reach the level of cult status of America s beloved mozzarella sticks, the dish is a marvel in cultural fusion deserving of acclaim in its own right. Cork Gabel, 2415 Michigan Ave. , Detroit 313 638 2261 corkandgabel. com. D Mon. Fri. , BR,L,D Sat. Sun. Smoke Show Seated at a communal table at Cork Gabel, my dinner guest perked up at the sight of an item being served to a diner sitting at the table behind me. It wasn t a dish that commanded his attention and that of the various other diners craning to catch a glimpse of the elaborate presentation but rather, to my surprise, one of the several cocktails on the restaurant s drink menu. Dubbed the O. F. A. F. , the drink is a unique take on a classic the old fashioned. It s encapsulated in a glass case filled with cherry wood chips and a cloud of smoke. Woodford Double Oaked Bourbon, rich demerara simple syrup, orange oil, and a blend of angostura and black walnut bitters are smoked behind the bar in that case and served tableside. Our waitress explained that in house smoking is one of the chef s prized techniques. On the food menu, you ll find smoked blue cheese made for dipping the saucy Gabel Wings, and applewood smoked bacon appears on the popular Schnitzel BLT. But nowhere is it more pronounced than in the artful O. F. A. F. The over the top cocktail comes at a lavish price of 25 for just one serving.  On this day in Detroit history: Final train departs Michigan Central Station Michigan Central Station served as a bustling transportation hub in Detroit until it closed in 1988. (Photo courtesy of Ford) DETROIT After a decline in train travel, the last train left Michigan Central Station on Jan. 5, 1988. Michigan Central served as a transportation hub in Detroit for 75 years. It opened earlier than planned on Dec. 26, 1913, after a fire at the old depot at Third and Jefferson avenues rendered that station inoperable. It was once bustling and booming, but that would change. The concourse at Michigan Central Station before the train depot shuttered. The main waiting room was closed in April of 1967. Amtrak would later take over the station in 1971, reopen the waiting room and pour more than 1 million into renovating MCS. This renovation included the addition of a bus terminal. However, those improvements weren t enough to save the station. As the Chicago bound train left MCS in 1988, the depot would begin a fall into decay and vandalism. Ad The video below is a segment from 1991, as the station started its descent toward decay. Vacancy and decay Over the next three decades, plans for the station would continually fall through. Real estate developer Mark Longton Jr. purchased the building in 1989 with plans to open a casino, however the plan never materialized. In 1996, Controlled Terminals Inc. , a company owned by Manuel Moroun, bought the station. MORE: A brief history of Michigan Central Station Since Moroun acquired the building, several ideas have been proposed for MCS, including a trade processing center, a casino, a new Detroit Police headquarters and a new Michigan State Police headquarters, but the space has remained empty. As the hulking structure stood unoccupied, it attracted both negative and positive attention. It became a place for vandals, homeless people and urban explorers. The inside and outside of the building were canvases for graffiti and the hundreds of windows were smashed. Scrappers also did a number on the station, stealing much of its wiring and plumbing. Ad The elements also took its toll, evident by the puddles pooling inside the building. Inside Michigan Central Station in July 2017 (Amber Ainsworth/WDIV) In the past few years, renovations have given the station a facelift. Security was ramped up as work started. New windows were installed in 2015, as well as an elevator that is able to transport heavy construction materials and machinery to the top floors. In 2018, 30 years after the station shuttered, new hope was announced. Ford shares plans for MCS Ford Motor Co. announced it had purchased the train station in the summer of 2018. Since then, the automaker has been pouring money into the depot, with intentions of moving its autonomous vehicle team into the building as part of a development that will include other buildings. Ad Ford is planning on creating a campus that will consist of about 1.2 million square feet of property in Corktown. The mixed use space will feature office space, retail space and residential housing. While efforts are underway to revitalize the building, Ford has said it plans to try to restore the depot to its former glory. It has turned to artifacts that were stolen and returned for inspiration, and it said original limestone will be used.  Gold Cash Gold restaurant in Corktown to close Gold Cash Gold, a 5 year old Corktown restaurant in an old pawn shop on the Detroit neighborhood's main drag, is set to close around Feb. 2. The Southern influenced American restaurant's chef partner Brendon Edwards disclosed the news in an email obtained by Crain's. The business will be up for sale, as well, according to co owner Phil Cooley, also of nearby Corktown staple Slows Bar BQ. Restaurant ownership declined to disclose the asking sale price. They plan to keep ownership of the renovated building at 2100 Michigan Ave. Edwards' email listed Feb. 2 as Gold Cash Gold's last day in business. But Cooley said sale details could affect the target date. Edwards cited a variety of reasons for the closure. He said business is slow in Corktown during the week, and in an increasingly populated restaurant market, diners are often driven to buzzy new places. "". we have battled with keeping weekday business which often is a hindrance to our bottom line,"" Edwards wrote in the email sent Friday evening. The end of the year was less profitable than expected, he wrote, and Gold Cash Gold faces a January without the extra business drummed up by the North American International Auto Show downtown. The event moved to June as of this year. Edwards and Cooley also spoke to Corktown's slower growth compared with other areas in the greater downtown. Downtown and Midtown have the foot traffic, but Corktown doesn't yet, Cooley said. He expressed optimism, though, with Ford Motor Co. 's renovation of Michigan Central Station underway as the centerpiece of a mobility focused satellite campus. Gold Cash Gold opened in late 2014. Its ownership includes brothers Phil and Ryan Cooley, as well as their father, Ron Cooley, and Toby Barlow and Brian Boyle. Phil Cooley said they plan to sell Gold Cash Gold's assets including liquor license and equipment as a turnkey restaurant to another owner who is at the time in their career where they want the challenge. Gold Cash Gold, in the crowded fine dining sector, was not profitable. But Cooley said he has ""nothing but tremendous respect"" for the staff, chef and leadership. There are no plans to sell Slows, Cooley said. There could be pop ups after the closure, and Gold Cash Gold plans to honor event bookings, Cooley said. Edwards wrote there could be future opportunities for staff, and that he would help those who want assistance finding other jobs. "". My heart is nothing but sad about this,"" Edwards wrote in the email. "". the goal I have had since day one here is to continue to grow and push and educate all who comes through our doors. Each person that leaves here I believe to be better than they came and for that I am happy. Detroit has been my home for a decade and I have been inspired by it and the people who work so diligently to make it better. "" Gold Cash Gold in Detroit's Corktown to close Feb. 2 Having a restaurant with automaker Ford Motor Company in your neighborhood could appear to be a gold rush. But Gold Cash Gold, Corktown s 70 seat eatery, located in a former pawn shop, is closing. Brendon Edwards, the chef at the helm of Gold Cash Gold, and his partner said brunch on Feb. 2 will be its final service. Edwards cited several factors in the decision to shutter. There is definitely some market saturation, he said. ""Corktown has not seen a population increase at the rate as downtown or Midtown. We import our customers, they drive from all over and there a lot of other restaurants. Another contributing factor, Edwards said, was the North American International Auto Show moving to June. Edwards said a large portion of its sales came in the first quarter and was based on the auto show. More:The latest in a string of closures, Royal Oak's Bistro 82 to shutter Jan. 25 More:Detroit's big restaurant stories in 2019 and what to look forward to in 2020 Between buys from actual automakers, Toyota and Hyundai supported us for a number of years, as well as some private parties and large parties of executives coming in, they all contributed to a good amount of our sales for the first quarter. "" Gold Cash Gold was open during the week for dinner and served brunch on Saturday and Sunday. Our brunch has been wildly successful and on Father s Day we served 350 in a 70 seat restaurant, Edwards said. Trying to keep up on the weekdays has been more of a struggle. Edwards indicated that after the closure, they are still looking at doing some pop ups and special events in the restaurant space. Edwards, 36, has been at the helm of the restaurant since late fall 2016 when the menu reflected many southern influences. Coming on board at Gold Cash Gold, Edwards said, he didn t want to be restricted to that cuisine, being so close to Slows Bar BQ. New American became the buzz words for describing the menu Edwards said it's a nod to letting you know you might be familiar with it. I wanted to diversify the cuisines within the neighborhood, Edwards said. Most recently the menu reflected Latin American and Spanish influences. Edwards' career has taken him to Michelin star restaurants in Chicago. And locally, his name has been part of the Detroit restaurant scene with stints at the Antietam, which closed in 2018, and Standby in downtown Detroit. The restaurant opened in December 2014. It was quickly named to late Free Press restaurant critic Sylvia Rector s Top 10 Best New Restaurant list for 2015. Its menu was noted as having southern influences. Gold Cash Gold is known for its pickle brined chicken and focus on farm to table fare, partnering with the likes of Guernsey Dairy, Wasem Fruit Farm and Stone Hedge Farm. The Corktown area has evolved into one of Detroit s trendiest neighborhoods. And Ford s investment in the area, including the redevelopment of Michigan Central Station, has given it a bigger boost. Gold Cash Gold is located nearly across the street from the train station. Real estate in the area has boomed. New condos and townhouses located just blocks away, on the site where Tiger Stadium used to stand, start around 400,000. More:Things are still raw inside Michigan Central Station but progress is happening I think that it s a really unfortunate thing to have to happen, Edwards said. But I think the entire staff as well as myself are proud of what we've done. We supported a lot of local farms. We started a lot programs we are proud of and . turning it from a restaurant that was at a bit of a loss to one of positive growth since I ve been here.

Greenwood District,"OSU-Tulsa offering course on history of Black Wall Street Quraysha Lansana, an adjunct professor at Oklahoma State University Tulsa, finds himself in the unique position of conducting a history course on the very grounds where many of the events he will teach about actually occurred. Black Wall Street, the History and Evolution of Greenwood is part of the Africana Studies curriculum. It was the brainchild of Lansana, who has been researching Black Wall Street and the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre for nearly 20 years. Presenting the subject matter in all its complex layers is a venture that Lansana, a poet and author himself, described as something very important to me. I m teaching about Black Wall Street while on Black Wall Street and that s significant, he said about the realization that his classroom sits in the shadow of the historic street. This history has not been taught by design throughout the state. Lansana, an Enid native who spent 28 years in Chicago before returning to Oklahoma in 2019, explained that the overall purpose of the undergraduate lecture style course was to share the narrative of Black Wall Street and the Greenwood District as more than just its demise as a result of the race massacre, though the events will be discussed at length. Black Wall Street, he said, thrived in the midst of rampant racial segregation in the early 1900s, and was the epicenter of black wealth and economic prosperity in Tulsa that predated black communities across America that experienced similar success during the period. We have to understand the importance of the vibrancy and vitality of Black Wall Street, said Lansana. Black folks thriving is something to celebrate. During the 16 week course, which began on Wednesday, students will study works such as Black Wall Street: From Riot to Renaissance in Tulsa s Historic Greenwood District by Tulsa author Hannibal Johnson, Death in a Promised Land: The Race Riot by historian Scott Ellsworth, Reconstructing Dreamland: by Alfred Brophy and Tulsa 1921: Reporting a Massacre by Tulsa World reporter Randy Krehbiel. Despite Lansana s ambition, interest in the new course from students at this point has been an issue in part because of its late addition to the OSU Tulsa course offering schedule, he said. The professor is hopeful that promotion through word of mouth and other avenues will create an enrollment surge. The class is open to undergraduates and non degree seeking students. The course enrollment deadline is Jan. 24. In the meantime, Lansana will focus all of his energies on providing students with an intimate look at a time and place in Tulsa s history that has remained until recently largely untapped in academia. I want to make the connection from what happened in the past to Tulsa in 2020, he said.

Before it was destroyed in 1921, the Historic Greenwood District used to be home to hundreds of locally owned small businesses. While the history of Black Wall street was almost snuffed out, the spirit of entrepreneurship for those who have roots in the area was not. There s a new business on Greenwood Street called the Black Wall Street Liquid Lounge, but it is much more than a coffee shop it s a symbol for what many hope is to come. We made a decision to open up a coffee shop to really bring back the memories of Black Wall Street ,"" said Guy Troupe. He and his wife, Yvette Troupe, opened their coffee shop on 10 North Greenwood Avenue S101 on Jan. 6. Like it s name suggests, the Black Wall Street lounge specializes in lattes, espressos and teas, but Troupe says the feeling of belonging is sweeter than any pastry they serve. ""That rich history that since of community how people understood the need to barter and trade to work together is really what we have to rebuild,"" Troupe said. ""To really create an environment to socialize and engage. Troupe says that spirit of Greenwood runs in his roots. My great aunt Lucile Troupe taught the majority of beauticians at Troupe s Beauty College in the 40s and 50s on historic Black Wall Street. Historic Greenwood Chamber of Commerce CEO, Dr. Freeman Culver, wants more people and businesses to feel that connected to Greenwood. This is a story of resiliency and success,"" said Dr. Culver. ""If it can happen right here on Greenwood it can happen again, some other place in America or some other place in the world. "" Which is why Dr. Culver and his colleague Stevyn Turner started a million dollar campaign to restore the 10 historical buildings that are left in the Greenwood's Black Wall Street after the 1921 Tulsa Massacre. ""Our ancestors would be proud if we could restore what they left to us,"" said Dr. Culver. If we can get this place to where it once was, it will be a hope to everyone, because that s the new American dream to be an entrepreneur. To donate, click here.

Follow us on Twitter Like us on Facebook  Martin Luther King Jr. spoke in Tulsa only once. But 60 years later, his 'inspiring and electrifying' presence has not been forgotten There was never any question about attending the funeral in Georgia. As soon as he heard, Jim Goodwin knew he was going to go. It didn t even have to be articulated, the Tulsan said. I felt compelled. To honor the life of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. , it was the least he could do, he added. Plus, Goodwin couldn t help feeling a small connection to King, their lives having once intersected. It had been brief. But, as he went on to join other mourners in Atlanta, he couldn t stop thinking about it. Eight years earlier, Goodwin, 20 at the time, had been present for King s only visit to Tulsa, and he even had a small speaking part. It was a great honor, he said of being called on to participate in the rally, which occurred on Thursday, July 28, 1960 60 years ago this year. And King did not disappoint, Goodwin said. Speaking to an overflow crowd at First Baptist Church North Tulsa, he was as inspiring and electrifying as they d heard. He boomed Her first time to see King in the flesh, Princetta Newman had to do a double take. He was not what I expected. He was too short, said the Tulsan, 16 at the time. I thought, It can t be him. But then she heard that voice. Even in everyday conversation, he boomed, she said. That s just how he talked. Newman was luckier than most: She got to meet King in person before his speech. She served as a hostess at a reception put on by Tulsa members of King s fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha. Newman s father, John Cloman, was a fellow Alpha, she said. It had been Cloman, as president of Tulsa s Colored Voters of America chapter, who invited King to town. Newman still has King s reply, a signed typewritten letter that she keeps in a frame. In it, he told Cloman that he planned to be in Oklahoma City soon but, regrettably, couldn t work Tulsa in. Fortunately, he was able to change the plan later. At the reception, King showed a more relaxed side, said Newman, whom he dubbed little Cloman. She remembers him as a jokester who liked to laugh. But all jokes aside, the commanding presence that could grab and hold an audience s attention was soon to be on full display. More than 1,500 people attended the church Freedom Rally, as it was billed. The then 31 year old pastor delivered a heartfelt message. It included a rousing call for unity: We must learn to live together as brothers, or we ll die together as fools, King told the audience. At the same time, he praised the effectiveness of nonviolent protest while urging black Tulsans to exercise their right to vote. Maybelle Wallace, like others on hand, soaked up King s every word. He was fighting for civil rights. Him coming to Tulsa it was something you wanted to be a part of, she said. Wallace, who recently turned 90, had a floor seat in the church sanctuary, which like the horseshoe shaped balcony above was crammed full, necks craning to see King. I even remember what I was wearing, she said. A black dress with a white front. My Sunday go to meeting dress. For such a tremendous occasion, nothing less would do. It was wonderful wonderful to see one of our leaders in person, Wallace said. King s appearance in Tulsa was co sponsored by the Oklahoma Eagle, the newspaper owned and operated by Goodwin s family. Goodwin, a Tulsa attorney and himself a onetime Eagle publisher, said he was home that summer from Notre Dame University, where he was about to start his senior year. Goodwin doesn t recall how he landed his part in the program introducing the Rev. Ben Hill of Vernon AME Church, who in turn introduced King. His best guess, he said, is that the late Hill, who wrote editorials for the Eagle, asked if he would introduce him. However it came about, the young college student found himself sharing an audience and pulpit with King. The place was packed, Goodwin said. And it was a very receptive audience. Afterward, many of the attendees stayed around. Newman said she was struck by how gracious King remained amid all the clamoring for his attention. King went on to spend that night at Tulsa attorney Amos Hall s house. The next morning, he attended a YWCA breakfast in his honor, speaking there to a group of pastors, before leaving for Oklahoma City. Goodwin can t see how anybody who heard King in Tulsa that night departed uninspired. More motivated than ever to make a difference, Goodwin returned to Notre Dame, where he went on to write his senior paper on racial injustice and black business. In the paper, a copy of which he still has, he talked about the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which destroyed the city s thriving black Greenwood District a subject not many were talking openly about then. We Shall Overcome Like much of the rest of the nation, when news of King s death broke eight years later, the Tulsans who d seen him were shaken. I was numb, and I stayed numb. It didn t seem real, said Newman, who had been in Memphis just days before King s assassination there in 1968. She was dating an activist there at the time, she said, and during a visit the previous weekend she had even seen King again. Newman was back in Tulsa when she got the phone call. Sometimes it still isn t real, she said. Wallace cried when she heard. It hurt me real bad, she said. It was very traumatic. It was such a tragic loss, added Goodwin, who started making plans to go to King s funeral. He meant so much to people and to the world, really. To be struck down by an assailant out of sheer hatred. And at a time when he was so desperately needed. Accompanied by his father and brother to Atlanta, Goodwin didn t try to get inside the packed Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the service was held, he said. But they joined in the march afterward, accompanying King s casket on foot through the streets. I remember we sang We Shall Overcome, Goodwin said. Newman said her hope is that future generations will keep alive the story of King and what he stood for. All these years later, there s still plenty of overcoming to do. He could make those same speeches again today, Newman said. His message, every word of it, is still appropriate and applicable.

Bloomberg pledges $70 billion to bolster black America in new plan TULSA, Okla. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will announce on Sunday his presidential campaign s plan aimed at bolstering economic opportunity for black Americans, promising to triple their income over the next decade, but stopping short of promising reparations. The announcement comes as the billionaire continues to face questions about the controversial ""stop and frisk"" police tactic he endorsed as mayor, and as he seeks to build support among African Americans, a key voting bloc in the Democratic primary. Bloomberg s Greenwood Initiative plan is named after the Greenwood District, otherwise known as Black Wall Street, a Tulsa neighborhood that was once considered one of the most economically prosperous black communities in the U. S. The neighborhood was the center of a deadly two day attack by a white mob during the 1920s. Ninety nine years later, Bloomberg will announce his plan in the same district. Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg addresses a news conference. (Photo: Reuters/Joshua Roberts) For hundreds of years, America systematically stole black lives, black freedom and black labor, Bloomberg will say, according to his prepared remarks. And the impact of that theft over a period of centuries has meant an enormous loss of wealth for individuals and families, across generations a kind of compound interest in reverse. Well, it s past time to say, Enough and to damn well do something about it. New York social activist and black leader Geoffrey Canada will be present in the audience and is expected to endorse Bloomberg later Sunday evening. Bloomberg, one of the richest men in the world, with a media empire and 50 billion estimated net worth, attributed some of his gains to the privileges that come with being a white man in America. I also know that my story might have turned out very differently if I had been black, and that more black Americans of my generation would have ended up with far more wealth, had they been white. Later in the speech, he is expected to add: I didn t know it at the time, but when my parents moved to the house I grew up in, the owners wouldn t sell to them. They didn t want a Jewish family in the neighborhood. Luckily for us, our Irish lawyer was willing to buy it and transfer it to my parents. But if my mother and father had been black, we would not have been so lucky. Story continues Bloomberg speaks to supporters in Texas.

The money will be controlled by a new White House office, the Neighborhood Equity and Opportunity Office, which will coordinate across federal agencies. The plan provided did not explicitly state the criteria to determine a level of disadvantage beyond being place based and evidence based. In his proposal, mortgage and loan guarantors will also be forced to update their credit scoring requirements, which the plan maintains is rigged against African Americans. Under the initiative, a new Housing Fairness Commission would be established with a 10 billion fund to work with localities and municipalities to test and potentially reserve housing laws that might discriminate against buyers or renters of color. Bloomberg s presidential bid has been clouded by his fraught history with the NYPD stop and frisk policy when he was mayor. For years, Bloomberg passionately defended the practice, which gave officers broad authority to stop and search anyone suspected of a crime. But critics saw the police tactic as discriminatory against black and brown New Yorkers, who were an overwhelming percentage of those stopped. Then, again in January of last year, in response to a question about the prejudiced perception of the policy, Bloomberg maintained that it had lowered crime rates. Bloomberg speaks at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, where he addressed his past support for ""stop and frisk"" tactics. (Photo: Yana Paskova/Getty Images) But several months later, as he was exploring announcing a presidential bid, Bloomberg apologized. I was wrong, he admitted at a black megachurch in Brooklyn. And I am sorry. Police brutality is mentioned twice in his Greenwood Initiative, which requires implicit bias training for the law enforcement agency. Specific forms of reparations did not appear in the plan. The reparations issue is often met by skittish behavior from presidential candidates, and none of the four frontrunners former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and former South Bend, Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg address reparations directly in their policies focused on black Americans. All have conceded that the idea be studied further. A senior Bloomberg adviser told Yahoo News that the former mayor s thinking on reparations is in line with his rivals in support of continued study. Read more from Yahoo News: Bloomberg pledges $70billion plan to invest in African American communities Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has made a 70billion campaign pledge named after the neighborhood destroyed during the 1921 Tulsa race massacre in a bid to tackle racial economic inequality in America. Bloomberg made a pitch to African American voters the day before the national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr during a visit to the Greenwood district, the site of the massacre. The former New York City mayor spoke out against an American history of race based economic inequality from slavery to segregation to redlining, and outlined a proposal aimed at increasing the number of black owned homes and businesses. Bloomberg's plan includes a 70billion investment in the nation's most disadvantaged neighborhoods. 'For black Americans, there was nothing that white landowners, businesses, banks, and politicians might not take: Their wages and their homes, their businesses and their wealth, their votes and their power, and even their lives,' Bloomberg said during a speech to several hundred people at the Greenwood Cultural Center, which houses artifacts and other memorabilia from the race massacre. Michael Bloomberg (pictured Sunday in Tulsa) has pledged a 70billion plan named after the neighborhood destroyed during the 1921 Tulsa race massacre in a bid to tackle racial economic inequality in America Bloomberg made a pitch to African American voters the day before the national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr during a visit to the Greenwood district, the site of the massacre. Black smoke billows from the fires during the race riot of 1921 in Tulsa, Oklahoma White mobs killed an estimated 300 black residents and injured 800 more. About 8,000 were left homeless after firebombs, destroyed movie theaters, churches and hotels and decimated the economic and cultural mecca that had become known as Black Wall Street (pictured) Bloomberg described the initiative as a 'plan for righting what I think are historic wrongs and creating opportunity and wealth in black communities'. The plan offers incentives for investment in underserved communities, increases support for black owned banks and ties federal housing money to progress in reducing segregation. It would require bias training for police, teachers and federal contractors, and address voter disenfranchisement practices such as ID requirements, poll purging and gerrymandering. 'As someone who has been very lucky in life, I often say my story would only have been possible in America, and I think that's true,' Bloomberg said. 'But I also know that my story would have turned out very differently if I had been black, and that more black Americans of my generation would have ended up with far more wealth, had they been white. ' Bloomberg also pledged to back a commission to study whether black Americans should receive reparations for slavery. Bloomberg described the initiative as a 'plan for righting what I think are historic wrongs and creating opportunity and wealth in black communities' The billionaire faced some criticism in November for visiting a black church in Brooklyn just days before launching his presidential bid, when he apologized for his longstanding support of the controversial 'stop and frisk' police strategy he embraced as mayor that disproportionately impacted people of color. The visit to Oklahoma, a Super Tuesday state whose primary is March 3, keeps with Bloomberg's strategy of skipping early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire and focusing on delegate rich Texas, California and others. Danyelle Solomon, vice president for race and ethnicity policy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said she was glad to see Bloomberg give the speech in Tulsa and show his awareness of how racism has had an impact over time, and was pleased that he announced policies specifically targeted at black communities. But while 'he hit some of the key points that need to be talked about,' she said, 'the devil is in the details'. Theodore Johnson, who studies race, politics and policy as as senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, said Bloomberg's pitch of calling for economic justice wasn't a new one, but that his record of business success could make people more inclined to listen. 'Because he's so successful . that when he talks about economic programming for black America, he actually knows what he's talking about,' Johnson said. But Johnson said black voters would be watching to see what else he did, or if it appeared that Sunday's event would be a one time speech. In the massacre, white mobs killed an estimated 300 black residents and injured 800 more. About 8,000 residents were left homeless after firebombs, including some dropped from airplanes, destroyed movie theaters, churches and hotels and decimated the economic and cultural mecca that had become known as Black Wall Street. The black community rebuilt in the decade that followed, but urban renewal programs in the 1950s and 1960s wiped out much of that progress, and the city remains largely segregated. THE 1921 TULSA RACE RIOT: AN ATTACK ON GREENWOOD After World War I, Tulsa was recognized for its affluent African American community known as the Greenwood District. The community was often referred to as the 'Black Wall Street' because of its thriving businesses and residential area. But in June 1921, the community was nearly destroyed during the Tulsa Race Riot. The events leading up to the riot began on May 30, 1921, when a young black man named Dick Rowland was riding in the elevator with a woman named Sarah Page. The details of what followed vary from person to person and it's unclear what actually happened. During the Tulsa Riot, 35 city blocks were completely destroyed and more than 800 people were treated for injuries. Historians believe as many as 300 people may have died in the riot Little Africa on Fire is the description given this photo of the Tulsa Race riot, June 1, 1917. The proper name of the African American section of town was Greenwood A group of National Guard Troops, carrying rifles with bayonets attached, escort unarmed African American men to the detention center at Convention Hall, after the Tulsa Race Massacre, Tulsa, Oklahoma, June 1921 Rowland was arrested the next day by Tulsa police. Subsequently, a report in the Tulsa Tribune dated May 31, 1921, started a confrontation between black and white armed men at the courthouse. This started a confrontation between black and white armed men at the courthouse, with the white men demanding that Rowland be lynched while the black men tried to protect him. During a struggle between two men in the mobs over a gun, shots were fired and a white man was shot, causing the the African American group to retreat to the Greenwood District. In the early morning hours of June 1, 1921, Greenwood was looted and burned by an estimated 10,000 white rioters, who flooded into the streets shooting residents. Planes also reportedly dropped incendiary bombs on the area. Many of the white mob had recently returned from World War I and trained in the use of firearms, are are said to have shot Black Americans on sight. In addition, more than 1,400 homes and businesses were destroyed, and nearly 10,000 people were left homeless. For two days starting on May 31 1921, an white mob estimated to be 10,000 strong destroyed Tulsa's Black Greenwood district, known as Black Wall Street, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 300 people and injuring 800 more The riots lasted for two days, and Governor Robertson declared martial law, and National Guard troops were called in to Tulsa. During the riot, 35 city blocks were completely destroyed. Historians believe as many as 300 people may have died in the riot mostly Black Americans and more than 800 people were treated for injuries. Bodies were buried in mass graves while families of those who were killed in the riots were held in prison under martial law according to Scott Ellsworth, a University of Michigan historian, in December. The families of the deceased were never told whether their loved ones died in the massacre, or where they were buried, and no funerals were held. Until the 1990s, the massacre was rarely mentioned in history books, and in 2001, the Race Riot Commission was organized to review the details of the deadly riot.

The killing of hundreds of people in a prosperous black business district in 1921 was referred to as the Tulsa race riot but it has since been relabeled as a 'massacre' Advertisement 'Although it's been nearly 100 years since the massacre took place, we are still dealing with issues of racism and inequality in our city,' said Mechelle Brown, program coordinator at the center. 'I think our community, especially, is dealing with the historical trauma to that has been passed down from generation to generation, specifically as it relates to the history of the massacre. 'Those feelings of fear, anger, bitterness, resentment have been passed down. ' In the past year, several presidential candidates visited the Greenwood district, including former Texas Rep Beto O'Rourke, New Jersey Sen Cory Booker and Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren. It was the first time that Brown could recall any major presidential candidate visiting the area. O'Rourke and Booker have seen quit the 2020 race. While those campaign stops are undoubtedly an attempt by Democratic candidates to reach black voters, a critically important segment of the party's electorate, they also present an opportunity for residents to meet the candidates firsthand, said Judy Eason McIntyre, who represented the district in the state Legislature for a decade. 'Yes, some will say it s pandering, but I m not one of those,' McIntyre said. 'It allows people to get to know them up close. It also maybe generates some excitement and knowledge about getting out to vote. ' Although Sunday's visit was Bloomberg's first campaign stop in Oklahoma, Bloomberg Philanthropies last year granted a 1million grant to the city to commission temporary works of art accessible to the public.  Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg unveils 'Greenwood Initiative' during campaign appearance in Tulsa With a nod to history, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg chose Tulsa to talk about economic inequality and barriers to African American enterprise. I ve never been one to look back, Bloomberg told several hundred spectators packed into the Greenwood Cultural Center Sunday afternoon. But facts are facts, Bloomberg said, and one of them is that few places in America are more indicative of the subject at hand than the very place he was standing. Aside from the death and violence of what is now known as the Tulsa Race Massacre, it was also one of the nation s single most destructive events in terms of African American wealth and capital. The arsonists fires that burned 35 square blocks of Tulsa s Greenwood District on the morning of June 1, 1921, burned millions of dollars in African American assets, and reduced to ashes years of blood, sweat and tears. And when, somehow, Greenwood rebuilt, it was destroyed again by social, economic and political forces once more beyond its residents control. It is a scenario that has played out many times throughout our nation s history, Bloomberg said Sunday. That, he said, is a fact Americans must acknowledge and make right. What happened here in Tulsa demonstrates, I think, in incredibly stark relief the destruction of a prosperous black community and the enormous obstacles black Americans face in not only accumulating wealth but in passing assets to children and grandchildren, Bloomberg said. He recited a list of tactics used over the years to intimidate black Americans and prevent them from voting, owning homes, growing businesses and generally advancing financially. I ask myself, the billionaire businessman said, Would I have built my business and enjoyed my success under these conditions? Of course not. The average white household, Bloomberg said, has an average net wealth 10 times that of the average black family. So Sunday, on North Greenwood Avenue, Bloomberg announced his plan which he called the Greenwood Initiative for doing something about that. His proposal has three broad objectives: increase black home ownership by 1 million, double the number of black owned businesses and triple black household wealth. The three, obviously, are intertwined, and Bloomberg promised they are not pie in the sky ideas that sound good but will never happen. These are concrete proposals that we can afford and we can get done. Bloomberg s 30 minute speech obviously targeted an African American audience. He had spent the morning across the street at Vernon AME Church and brought with him John Rogers Jr. , head of the nation s largest minority run mutual fund, but more importantly for his Sunday audience, the great grandson of J. B. Stradford, one of the heaviest financial losers in the race massacre. He spoke almost entirely about past and present inequities affecting African Americans. Bloomberg s audience, though, turned out to be more white than black. It also included some notable local figures, including fellow billionaire George Kaiser, a large contingent of Democratic lawmakers past and present, and Columbia, South Carolina, Mayor Steve Benjamin, one of Bloomberg s campaign co chairs. As a late entry into the Democratic field, Bloomberg is counting on making up ground in Super Tuesday primaries, including Oklahoma s, in the first week of March. As part of that, Bloomberg is trying to win over black voters. Sunday he addressed one obstacle to that, his use of stop and frisk policing while mayor of New York. As he has in the past, Bloomberg said he was wrong to employ such a tactic on its original scale and curtailed the practice once he realized how unfair it was. Which returned Bloomberg to his topic for the day. I believe we have the power to build a future where color and capital are not entwined, he said. That is the future I want to leave my grandchildren.

age with Dr. King's messages. Having read the essays they wrote, you can tell these are subjects kids really care about, with the first closures starting at 5:30 a. m. and the last roads reopening at 2 p. m.  Black Tulsans express cautious optimism, disappointment in hiring of city's first black police chief In the Greenwood District, Robert Gray walked into Tee s Barber Shop out of the cold for his 1 p. m. appointment. Barber shop owner Willie Sells turned down the impeachment hearings on his two TVs to chat about Maj. Wendell Franklin s appointment to police chief, something they both said they saw as a step in the right direction for the community and the Police Department. Sells said while it s a big deal to see Franklin named police chief, he wants to see Mayor G. T. Bynum go to bat for his pick. Since (Bynum) appointed him, it means he does support him, Sells said. But now he s got to back him regardless, because police chiefs have a great responsibility. He needs the backing of the mayor, and the mayor has to have his back so they work together. It s a good historical moment for Tulsa. I didn t expect it. Gray, who has known Franklin and his family for years, chuckled as he referred to the new chief as kid. He said he knew Franklin was qualified for the job and that he remains cautiously optimistic about the department s future. A lot of things on the racial divide will get more attention, Gray said. But change won t come overnight. Change takes time. No one should expect that just because he was appointed means change is coming next week. Despite Franklin s being named the city s first black police chief, support for the Tulsa Police Department among minority residents still remains complicated at best. Some think Franklin s historic appointment is worthy of some fanfare within Tulsa s African American community, whose residents finally have a person who looks like them leading the police force. For others, having a black police chief does not temper long held skepticism and distrust of policing as an institution. I think it s important that Tulsa has a black police chief, said Thomas Boxley, chairman of the Greater Tulsa African American Affairs Commission. But the institution of policing is what it is. It remains to be seen what the impact is. Boxley said early policing in America was borne of slave patrols, and he said officers historical treatment of black citizens is a reason for him to be cautious even though a black man now leads TPD. People are still going to be skeptical and still be critical regardless, he said. It doesn t matter who the face is when there is so much work to be done. That work, Boxley said, will involve eradicating a culture within the department that intentional or not has led to allegations of racial bias against officers while patrolling communities of color. Gregory Robinson II, director of family and community ownership at the Met Cares Foundation, has a different expectation in mind before fully committing to the new chief. He wants Franklin before his first day on the job to apologize for comments that suggested he did not back claims of discrimination and racism within the Police Department in a 1994 lawsuit filed by a group of black Tulsa police officers. Franklin said in 2003 that he didn t see or experience evidence of racial bias within the department. We want to make sure we have the best police chief possible for Tulsa, Robinson said. But he (Franklin) is on record as being against the lawsuit brought by black officers. We want to see if he would renounce that position. It is the only way to move forward. If he will not, we will not stand in support of the chief even though he will be the first African American chief. In a letter attributed to north Tulsa elected officials, the Terence Crutcher Foundation, faith leaders and activist group Demanding a JUSTulsa, frustration was expressed that Bynum failed to consider the many concerns regarding the police chief search. Time and again we hear calls for the community to come to the table and work with city leaders to drive toward change, the letter states. Unfortunately, whenever the community seeks to do exactly that, our mayor chooses not to engage. The Rev. Robert Turner of Vernon AME Church also viewed Franklin s hiring as a disappointment from the perspective that Bynum did not seriously consider external candidates, something he and other community leaders were candid about during public discussions. Turner also took issue that Franklin was elevated from major, unlike other internal candidates who were all experienced deputy chiefs. Those issues are why the pastor is taking a wait and see approach, especially as it relates to what methods Franklin will deploy to address the police community divide and whether he will implement long sought police reforms. You can t fix that alone by having a black police chief, he said. It (the department) needs some policy. Just like having a black president didn t get rid of racism in America. Position is one thing. Policy is another. We hope he implements the policies that are needed.

It might not look like much, but to the pastor of a local church that burned during the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, the chair is a symbol of survival and perseverance. That chair is from our basement, the Rev. Robert Turner said. So immediately after the (Tulsa Race) Massacre, we came back to worship in our basement, and we sat in those chairs. The historic Vernon AME Church recently donated several artifacts to Greenwood Leadership Academy in an effort to reestablish the greatness of the Greenwood District. Other donations include salvaged photos from the original site s basement. About 90 City Year and AmeriCorps members, along with 250 volunteers, spent Monday painting murals and inspirational quotes, creating educational displays and decorating classroom entrances with the names of black businesses that existed in Greenwood. These organizations came together to fill the school with learning opportunities about Black Wall Street while also honoring its legacy and survivors. They called the project the Greenwood Experience. Turner said his congregation donated the artifacts because of Greenwood Leadership Academy s potential to educate children from the area. The elementary school, which became the state s first partnership school in 2017 18 and operates under the Tulsa Public Schools umbrella, aims to transform the academic and social outcomes of north Tulsa students and promote excellence in all facets of the community. We also want to show them how the sustaining power of God can continue to keep for generations to come, Turner said. These artifacts survived. The church survived. We hope they realize how resilient they can be, even in their life. Things may get hard. I know those tests are difficult. Assignments are rough. But you come from a rich legacy that has overcome so much, and that should encourage them to go farther. Pictures of Black Wall Street businesses and residents are displayed near the entrance of the school. Next to those are images of current students and their families. By putting the photos side by side, school officials hope students will be able to see themselves as part of a rich and timeless story of Greenwood s success and excellence. The idea is that our kids are going to know these names and know their stories and see these people as their foreparents, said Ray Owens, founder of the MetCares Foundation, which runs the school and employs its teachers. In addition to classrooms resembling historic Black Wall Street businesses, the school s hallways now mirror the boundaries of the Greenwood District and feature signs of local streets. Some students expressed excitement this week after seeing their hallway named after the street where they live or their classroom named after a place in their neighborhood. Establishing these connections, Owens said, helps students and even their parents see Greenwood Leadership Academy as a place that s meant for them. In African American and oftentimes brown communities, parents have not felt very comfortable in school spaces they don t feel like they belong. They re not sure they re accepted, he said. We ve tried very hard at GLA to reverse that phenomenon. Owens also believes the enhanced look and new chance to introduce kids to their community s history will help Greenwood Leadership Academy advance its vision and better overcome missteps that were made in the school s early days. GLA became mired in controversy at the end of its first year after a former teacher reportedly placed a student with special needs in a locker. The school also faced a high number of suspensions and raised concerns about disciplinary issues. Suspensions have decreased since then, and Owens hopes to see some remarkable gains at the end of this year. He also said it takes three to five years to turn a school in the direction of excellence. Next year will be GLA s fourth year. What we know now, and really what we knew then, is that it s hard to open a school because you re not just teaching kids, he said. You re creating systems and actually getting kids and families to execute on those systems, and that s really hard. City Year Chief of Staff Hollis McAllister said her nonprofit became involved with creating the Greenwood Experience as part of its annual wide scale service project on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The projects have been a way to honor King and help schools manifest the goals they have for their students and communities. Last year, City Year painted murals of Hale Junior High s logos and creed throughout its building. This year, McAllister said, the organization wanted to undertake a project that helped students connect with their history. It didn t take long to identify a place that wanted the same thing. The initiative proved to be an emotional and insightful experience for those who brought the spirit of Greenwood to a school born from its legacy. It s actually been a really great opportunity for the AmeriCorps members who are serving with us and the volunteers who joined us for that day to not only serve and help a school reach its goals but also to help themselves connect with the history, McAllister said. People were learning about aspects of Black Wall Street while they were painting those things on the walls.

Black Wallstreet Grand Rapids announces capital campaign An economic development startup that is looking to create opportunity zones for Black entrepreneurs in Grand Rapids said Monday that it is launching a 16 year, 100 million capital campaign with a primary focus on raising funds from the private sector. Preston Sain, co founder, president and director of Black Wallstreet Grand Rapids (BWSGR), announced the soft launch of the group s capital campaign through which it will seek to secure 100 pledges of 1 million each over 16 years. The number 16 is significant, Sain said, because it is the number of years that it took to build the former Greenwood District aka Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma, into a thriving business district before it was destroyed in the 1921 Tulsa massacre by white rioters. Sain said BWSGR aims to secure 100 pledges from a diverse group of Fortune 500 company owners, corporations, CEOs, other donors and out of state investors by June 1 the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa massacre. We are currently structuring our accounting team, and we are excited about the number 100, Sain said. We look to uphold the spirit of the original Black Wall Street founders and builders to develop Black Wallstreet Grand Rapids over the next 16 years. He said BWSGR s goal is not only to make Grand Rapids the No. 1 city for economics and quality of life in the U. S. , but to restore the essence of Black Wall Street and inspire nationwide inclusion, economic excellence and wealth building for Black citizens in America and abroad. Black Wallstreet Grand Rapids is currently seeking a 501(c)3 nonprofit fiduciary partner for the capital campaign, which would make all pledged donations 100% tax deductible. For contributions that are classified as investments, Sain said there will be an opportunity and option to become equity stakeholders in our districts where there is a fit and shared interest. After we complete our campaign and confirm all 100 pledges, we then will set up our official meeting date with the mayor of Grand Rapids and the (Grand Rapids) City Commission to present our then completed business plan along with our 100 capital pledges on file, he said. This meeting will consist of approval of permits, zoning logistics in targeted districts, brand licensing and more. BWSGR aims for both private and public sector partnerships in our capital campaign with the main focus being the private sector. If and when city commission approval prevails, we then will officially accept all confirmed donation pledges into account with our nonprofit partner to begin the development of the BWSGR districts. The campaign will seek 16 year annual commitments of 62,500 from donors, partners and shareholders to begin developing the BWSGR districts, Sain said. The first and main priority district of development in Year One will be the Burton Eastern Village district to support and build upon current and ongoing progress in the area, he said. Sain added that BWSGR, which began in June, has already seen an outpouring of community support from city officials, business owners and citizens of all races. He said the nonprofit fiduciary for the capital campaign will be announced at a later date. More information about Black Wallstreet Grand Rapids is on the group s Facebook page.

Chicken less Egg Connoisseur Arturo Elizondo """"Like any good Mexican", I had two eggs for breakfast every morning, and like any good Texan I had my barbeque every Sunday, says Arturo Elizondo. But when he learned about the devastating impacts that livestock has on the environment, he set out to find a better, more sustainable way to produce animal protein. In 2014, he co founded Clara Foods with cell biologist David Anchel with a mission to take animals out of animal proteins. Similar to how brewers use yeast to convert sugar into alcohol for beer, Clara Foods uses yeast and sugar to produce animal protein. Specifically, Elizondo and his team are working to produce egg proteins one of the most challenging to find alternatives for. One trillion eggs are consumed across the globe each year, but it takes a whopping 600 gallons of water to produce a dozen eggs, he says. Since they're so versatile and globally loved, Clara Foods is offering a cleaner alternative so that people can still enjoy eggs in all their culinary forms without the tremendous environmental impact. Clara Foods has been knee deep in research and development for the last six years," but the company is officially coming out of their """"eggshell"""" in 2021 when they launch the world's first egg protein made without a chicken", Elizondo says. Problem Solving Wunderkind Gitanjali Rao As a 15 year old, Gitanjali Rao is the youngest innovator on our list, but she's certainly one to watch. She's already tackling some of the greatest problems affecting current generations: lack of access to clean water, opioid addiction and cyberbullying. After hearing about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, Rao was shocked to learn that people in the United States and beyond still don't have access to safe, clean water. In response, she invented Tethys a sensor that can detect lead in water and upload results from the water sample to an app, allowing users to quickly and affordably see if water is safe to drink. She's also worked to address the opioid crisis by developing Epione, a way to diagnose prescription opioid addictions for patients at the onset of addiction, after hearing about a family friend who developed an addiction after a car accident. And to address cyberbullying a problem especially relevant to her age group Rao developed Kindly, an artificial intelligence powered software that detects hurtful or harmful messages and then prompts users to rephrase what they send. Her thoughtful," problem solving innovations earned her the title of TIME's 2020 Kid of the Year. """"My motivation to solve problems in society started in a very simple manner: to solve problems that we face on a daily basis"," she says. """"I try my best to understand them and look for ways to address them. I am not always successful", but the few times I've succeeded, I feel like I have contributed in some way. To inspire others to innovate, Rao has connected with about 35,000 students across four continents and has more events planned in the coming months. As she moves forward in 2021, Rao says she has more ideas in the works and that she'll continue developing her current innovations as she searches for the partners to help her out. Storytelling Composer Barron Ryan On May 31,1921, a mob of white residents attacked the Greenwood District, a predominantly black neighborhood, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in what's known as the Tulsa Race Massacre. The attack one of the worst acts of racial violence in American history continued through the next day as the mob killed more than 300 black Tulsans, displaced 10,000 others and burned more than 35 city blocks to the ground. To commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, Chamber Music Tulsa commissioned composer and performer Barron Ryan to tell the story of the tragedy through a piano trio. As a Tulsa native," Ryan says that it's important for him to tell this story a story that needs to be remembered. """"It's an integral part of who I am", and I'm honored to do it," he says. """"Music can tell a story without using words"," and it has an unparalleled ability to communicate"""" Ryan says", which is what he aspires to do with his trio. In composing the piece, he looked through firsthand accounts of the massacre. He read about a woman who hid with her daughter and read psalms as the attack raged on. Psalm 88:3 spoke to Ryan, and it ultimately inspired the melody. One of the verses reads," """"My soul is full of troubles", which Ryan borrowed as the title of his trio. He hopes that his music inspires people to reflect on the Tulsa Race Massacre and to be courageous to do what s right and not simply what is easy," he says. """"I'm hoping that it's well received"," and that we remember our history as Tulsans and learn the right lessons and not repeat something like this again. """" Transit Trailblazer Andrea Ponti The Covid 19 pandemic brought public transportation to a screeching halt as people who had the means to travel in their own private vehicles opted to do so. Andrea Ponti", the founder and director of Ponti Design Studio, took the opportunity to re think and re plan how we get around. Inspired by social distancing, he developed Island, an electric tram designed for a post pandemic Hong Kong," the city where he resides. """"When the pandemic took over Hong Kong", many people turned to private transport causing a dramatic increase in traffic, pollution and noise," he says. """"What makes Island attractive is that it helps to solve all those problems. The bottom line is technology needs good design in order to be efficient and accessible to most people"," and I think Island might be an example of that. """" Instead of sitting in rows", the tram's seats are organized in circles," or """"islands"," seating people with their backs towards each other so they can look out the window instead of facing others. """"To me that is a safer way to commute and a fun way to take in the city sights and see Hong Kong from a different viewpoint", he says. Plus, the tram is electric and driverless," making it eco friendlier and more efficient. """"As a designer I really like the challenge of re imagining products and services that we often take for granted and that can be greatly impacted by social changes in this case re designing trams at the time of social distancing in a metropolis like Hong Kong where social distancing is hard to practice", he says. Ponti started developing Island in March 2020 and has since modeled the tram and produced a number of prototypes. Moving forward in 2021, he is working to scale the protypes, move into the testing phase and secure a partner to produce Island. Honoring Black History with Anitra Belle Henderson In 1860, a plantation owner smuggled in a shipload of 110 African people to Alabama on the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States, decades after the U. S. had banned the importation of enslaved people. When enslaved people were freed in 1865, survivors of the Clotilda couldn't afford to return to Africa, so they founded Africatown instead, a bustling town rooted in their homelands and cultures. After years of searching for the long lost Clotilda, a team of historians and archaeologists finally discovered it at the bottom of Alabama's Mobile River in 2019. Now," the City of Mobile will open a heritage house in the summer of 2021 to tell the story of the Clotilda's survivors and of Africatown. """"We are excited to help the community tell their story", says Anitra Belle Henderson," the executive director of communications and external affairs for the City of Mobile and the lead on all the Africatown projects. """"Our goal is for visitors to understand more about those who were enslaved. They have a name and a story. """" The heritage house is designed to be an immersive experience. Visitors will feel the waves of the ocean like the enslaved people felt on their voyage", read stories of the slave trade and be introduced to the survivors of the Clotilda. They'll also be able to visit Africatown," where many descendants of the Clotilda's survivors still reside. """"Each detail of the heritage house was designed with reverence to the ancestors", descendants and the community," Belle Henderson says. """"Those who are curious about African culture can visit an African community on American soil a community that was built with hope and promise. """" """"The many stories show the diverse brilliance of black people"," she says. """"Since the discovery of the Clotilda there has been a new excitement in the community. Educating people about Africatown's past will definitely create a bright future for a community that so deserves the attention it is receiving. """" Nautical Visionary Brett Phaneuf In April 2021", the Mayflower Autonomous Ship, one of the world's first full sized self navigating ships, will set sail from the United Kingdom's Plymouth Harbor and traverse the Atlantic Ocean to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. It will retrace the voyage made by the original Mayflower in 1620 that brought Pilgrims to New England, but instead of looking back at 400 years of history, it represents what the next wave of nautical advances will look like. The Mayflower Autonomous Ship is a collaboration between the marine research organization ProMare and IBM, which developed the ship's artificial intelligence systems that will allow it to navigate unassisted across the ocean. The Mayflower team is hoping to revolutionize ocean research by creating an affordable option for scientists to study the ocean without necessarily being on board a ship. Without needing to worry about the logistics for housing people on board, like sleeping, eating and sanitation, the ship can accommodate more technology, like cameras and sensors," and stay out at sea longer. """"If it works as designed", then it will substantially drive down the cost of collecting data at sea, says Phaneuf," a co founder and co director of the Mayflower Autonomous Ship project. """"This will lead to a better understanding of our oceans and climate. """" Phaneuf's biggest hope for the Mayflower is that it makes it across the ocean and sparks the conversation about how autonomous ships can be used to study the high seas. During this first voyage", the ship will collect meteorological and oceanographic data as well as water samples to study microplastic distribution. Student Advocate Samantha Pratt Two thirds of all U. S. youth face at least one trauma by age 16 that can stem from poverty, racism, domestic or community violence, or substance abuse, says Samantha Pratt," the CEO and founder of KlickEngage. """"Students carry heavy emotional backpacks into the classroom every day that they cannot put down"," she says. """"I was teaching high need students in an overcrowded classroom and could not check in with each of my students every day in order to address their issues. Out of urgent need"," I decided that I had to find a way to streamline student self report. """" To do so", Pratt designed KlickEngage an app that allows users to self report their mental state each day by completing a two minute survey. The app, which has reached thousands of kids, then provides students with targeted coping mechanisms while delivering real time data to educators so that they can identify and supports students carrying heavy emotional loads, Pratt says. Schools have the ability to make a huge impact for students by providing health services and resources," but they're often limited and underfunded. """"By directly serving students", teachers and schools, we limit the impacts of adverse experiences on school engagement in early years of education so that there is a higher likelihood of student success in later years, breaking the cycle of trauma and poverty, Pratt says. Students are still facing adversities, plus the compounded issues brought on by the Covid 19 pandemic, such as unemployment, food insecurity and fear based anxiety, Pratt says. Since KlickEngage is able to be adapted for a physical or virtual learning environment, it can help educators check in with students, even from a distance. In 2021, KlickEngage is planning to grow its impact and reach more classrooms. Pandemic Inspired Architects Jing Liu and Florian Idenburg In 2020, homes transformed into all in one offices, gyms, daycares, classrooms, vacation destinations and restaurants as people's lives became confined to their residences. As a result, people noticed just how important their home environment is to their mental and emotional wellbeing, say Jing Liu and Florian Idenburg, the founding partners of SO IL, an architecture and design firm. At the outset of the Covid 19 pandemic, Liu and Idenburg were in the beginning stages of designing a new 30 unit residential building in Brooklyn. They also found themselves adjusting to living and working from home with their two daughters, and they say that experience helped shape the design for the new building, to be completed in 2022. Now that people are home all the time, Liu and Idenburg needed to create a space that was both multi functional and comfortable for residents. For example, they moved bedrooms to opposite sides of the apartment to muffle noise and distractions, which are typically clustered together. They also incorporated multiple outdoor spaces for each unit, creating easy access to fresh air and sunshine. The pandemic has highlighted what people really need in their homes, and architecture trends in the future will reflect that," they say. """"The main lesson to take away is that the lifespan of a building will be longer than the interval between pandemics"," they say. """"From a sustainability standpoint"," we should endeavor to build buildings that last 'forever. ' It means we need to design for future pandemics. """" Mosquito Trapping Mastermind Kennyjie When industrial designer Kennyjie (he prefers to go by just his first name) was 12 years old"," he contracted dengue fever a flu like disease transmitted by mosquitos while living in Indonesia. """"Being able to afford long hospital care", I was one of the privileged kids who walked out alive, he says. Mosquito borne disease prevention has remained an issue close to his heart, and it's the driving force behind his new innovation, Quito. While visiting Bali, Kennyjie noticed that the mosquito prevention tactics were inconvenient and ineffective, so he set out to design his own. Quito, which made the International Top 20 for the James Dyson Award in 2020, uses a simple chemical reaction to produce carbon dioxide and an artificial human odor to attract mosquitoes, and then it vacuums them into a chamber. By luring mosquitoes in instead of repelling them, Quito reduces their local population and the chance of disease transmission. It's designed to be placed in tropical resorts to lessen the likelihood of an outbreak as people travel in and out of the region. Kennyjie traveled through multiple Indonesian villages to ensure that Quito's design is informed by the local culture," economy and climate so that it fits into the """"geographical context in which it is needed", he says. This year, Kennyjie will continue running more tests from his home in Melbourne, Australia, until international borders are open and he can start pilot tests in Indonesia.  When Americans Committed Insurrection Weekly Newsletter The best of The Saturday Evening Post in your inbox! Join World leaders of the 1770s laughed at the idea of a modern democracy. Hadn t men proved repeatedly they were incapable of governing themselves? That was the reason all nations were ruled by kings, or the military, or a wealthy elite. America has run its democratic experiment more or less successfully for more than 200 years, but not without moments of tension. Our democratic republic has confronted the violence stirred by small factions of angry groups. The times and places have varied, but the root causes are usually the same three: economic inequality, immigration, and race. 1. Economic Inequality: High unemployment and reduction of wages led to The Great Railroad Strike of 1877, which led to violent confrontations in nine major cities, sometimes with federal troops firing on civilians. Subscribe and get unlimited access to our online magazine archive. Subscribe Today And in the 1999 Seattle protests of the World Trade Organization Conference, a conservative crowd of 4,000 tried to obstruct the conference. Before it was over, 600 people were arrested and the city had seen over 20 million in damage to property. 2. Immigration: Because of their resentment of the wave of Irish immigrants entering the country, anti immigrant mobs in Philadelphia set fire to homes, churches, seminaries. At least 13 Catholic churches were burned and 20 people killed. When New Orleans police chief was murdered in 1891, the city indicted 19 suspects, all of whom were Italian Americans. When it appeared nine would later be set free, a mob broke into the jail and murdered 11 of the prisoners. 3. Race: Judging from our history, race is the deepest, most divisive, and most enduring cause for civil unrest. The examples of racial violence are numerous: Watts, April 11 16, 1965: Racial tensions in Los Angeles exploded with rumors of police brutality at a traffic arrest. Six days of mayhem left 34 dead and 3,500 arrested. Detroit, July 23 27, 1967: police actions in shutting down an illegal bar led to assaults, arson, and mass destruction. It resulted in 43 dead,2,000 buildings destroyed,7,300 arrests. Los Angeles, April 29 May 4, 1992: a video of police beating Rodney King led to the arrest of four policemen. When they were subsequently acquitted of the beating, Black protests led to a wave of looting, assaults, and arson and left 63 dead and 12,000 arrested. Tulsa, May 31 June 1, 1921: a white mob descended on the Black Greenwood District, beating inhabitants and destroying Black homes and businesses. Thirty nine were confirmed dead but later research has offered reason to believe the total could have been as high as 300. New York Draft, July 13 16, 1863: Irish immigrants who faced conscription in the Union army learned that wealthy New Yorkers were paying substitutes to take their place in the fighting. Their anger grew with resentment of having to fight to free Blacks, whom they considered as their rivals for jobs. White rioters attacked Black citizens and burned two Black churches and a Black orphanage. They even fell upon federal troops sent to the city fresh from the battle at Gettysburg. In three days of rioting, over 100 Black men, women, and children were killed. Federal Insurrections Yet, until 2021, Americans had confronted federal authority with armed aggression just four times. 1. Shay s Rebellion In the Fall of 1786, thousands of New Englanders rose in protest against harsh tax laws in a time when money was scarce in the new states. Armed protestors in what came to be known as Shay s Rebellion interrupted county courts, demanding legislative action to alleviate tax burdens. Over 1,500 protestors tried to seize weapons at the armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. They were driven back by state led militia forces. By Spring of 1787, some of the protestors had turned to looting shops and homes. After a bloody confrontation in which 30 insurrectionists were wounded, the rebellion melted away. In return for amnesty,4,000 Americans ultimately confessed to taking part in the rebellion. Two leaders were hung. The Federal Government s inability to respond effectively to the uprising was one reason legislators felt the country needed a Constitution to strengthen its central government. 2. The Whiskey Rebellion Just four years later, farmers were arming themselves in protest against an excise tax on whiskey. Whiskey was an important source of income for farmers, enabling them to turn their corn crops into valuable, easily transported merchandise. Whiskey was frequently used as currency in 1791, when little cash was circulating among farmers. In protest against the new whiskey tax, several tax collectors were tarred and feathered. Consequently, no excise tax was collected for 1791 and 1792. Farmers next began threatening neighbors who supported enforcing the tax, and sometimes burned their barns. A mob attacked the home of a federal tax inspector, and several members were killed in gunfire. Some protestors now proposed declaring independence from the U. S. and allying with another nation. Others talked of marching on Pittsburgh, looting the homes of the wealthy, and burning the city to the ground. Fortunately, President Washington responded by leading an army of nearly 13,000 into western Pennsylvania. This show of force and Washington s promise of clemency was enough to end the uprising. 3. John Brown and Harper s Ferry In 1859, John Brown and over 20 followers seized the federal arsenal at Harper s Ferry, Virginia. He had planned to distribute the weapons to Black Americans and launch a slave uprising. He and his followers were captured by federal troops. Brown was hung, but became a martyr to many abolitionists who opposed slavery. 4. The Battle of Fort Sumter And then, there s the fourth insurrection, which arose from a losing side s anger over a presidential election. On April 12,1861, military forces of South Carolina fired on the federal fort in Charleston Harbor, Fort Sumter, to force out its Union troops. The siege started a four year long insurrection better known as the Civil War that left over 600,000 Americans dead. It destroyed slavery, but not racism, and it led to countless mob actions that still recur even today. In many regards, this last insurrection never fully ended. Many Americans are still divided over the issue of what constitutes racial justice. And for many, the Confederacy, though defeated 160 years ago, is still a living embodiment of what America should be. There appears to be no urgency in ending this division, which keeps the country perpetually weak and divided. This divide would seem to support one of John Adams s darker warnings: Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts," and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.

""The Mid Hudson Valley is home to some of our state's most breathtaking natural resources and open space, and we're committed to ensuring these views and landscapes are protected for generations to come,"" Cuomo said. ""These investments will allow us to add ecologically significant lands and new trails to seven state parks across the region, further promoting tourism and building on our efforts to strengthen this world class outdoor destination. "" State Parks will invest 11.4 million in Environmental Protection Fund and Hudson Highlands Conservation Act funding to six parks beginning in 2020, including: Hudson Highlands State Park Preserve 965 acres. The new lands include two parcels: a 20 acre parcel that will create new trail routes, provide new views of West Point and the Hudson River, and connect Arden Point on the Hudson River with the remainder of Hudson Highlands State Park and the 945 acre Scofield Ridge, which will protect the largest remaining private inholding in the Hudson Highlands, allow a public trail with breathtaking views and safeguard a significant ecological and biodiversity corridor through the 8,900 acre park in Dutchess and Putnam Counties. Minnewaska State Park Preserve 633 acres. This includes several parcels and is a major addition to the northeastern section of Minnewaska State Park Preserve in Ulster County, protecting a wilderness gorge through which the Peterskill stream flows and several rocky summits, including Dickie Barre, Ronde Barre and portions of Rock Hill. The assemblage will increase recreational opportunities on the north end of the park and protect important views both from the park and the adjacent Rondout Valley. The acreage will also protect important wildlife habitat and prevent fragmentation of the forest in the northern Shawangunk Mountains. The 24,000 acre park in Ulster County is the third largest state park in New York. Schunnemunk State Park 158 acres. This major addition to Schunnemunk State Park in Orange County will provide a critical link to an anticipated public trail between Schunnemunk State Park and Storm King Arts Center, while protecting Moodna Creek watershed. Schunnemunk State Park, now more than 4,000 acres, offers 360 degree views of adjacent valleys, the distant Hudson River and surrounding forest and farmlands. Sterling Forest State Park 112 acres. This land will create access to the 22,000 acre Sterling Forest State Park and to the Appalachian Trail from the western side of the park. Rockefeller State Park Preserve 1 acre. The parcel will remedy the longstanding lack of a formal entry to Rockwood Hall, a historic and impressive riverside section of the nearly 1,800 acre preserve in Westchester County, allowing appropriate signage and parking for public access. Fahnestock State Park 150 acres. This property will protect natural resources as well as connect the park to a local Scout Reservation that has a trail open to the public. The state is acquiring this through a partnership with the Hudson Highlands Land Trust. The preservation of nearly 2,000 acres of open space in the region is already underway with previously acquired parcels, including: Schunnemunk State Park 808 acres. These lands permanently protect open space that had been targeted for major residential development and extend a significant conservation corridor between Black Rock Forest and Schunnemunk Mountain. New York State Parks has entered into a 10 year management agreement with the Open Space Institute to maintain the 702 acre ""Legacy Ridge,"" a forested parcel in Woodbury. OSI will manage the property, create a trailhead and add trails for public use and enjoyment. Minnewaska State Park Preserve 740 acres. The acquisitions from the Open Space Institute on the southeast edge of the Preserve include the largest remaining tract of privately held open space on the Shawangunk Ridge and help preserve globally rare pitch pine barrens that occur at Sam's Point as well as a stretch of the Verkeerderkill. At Minnewaska State Park, OSI's conveyance brings its total additions to the park to more than 13,000 acres. Harriman State Park 404 acres. The property is located less than a mile from the Harriman Metro North train station and allows for greater public access to the park. The property also connects to the Long Path, a celebrated long distance hiking trail which runs just east of the property and links to a four mile network of carriage roads and trails originally by the Harriman family, which were protected by OSI in 2017.  NY Gov Proposes Mid-Hudson Valley Land Preservation As part of the State of the State address he ll deliver Wednesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo aims to preserve 4,000 acres in the mid Hudson Valley. The land acquisitions would add buffers and trails to seven state parks as well as conserve ecological corridors. These are really true recreational and ecological gems in our region, Sullivan says. One of the seven state parks is Hudson Highlands State Park Preserve, which spans Dutchess and Putnam Counties, and where Cuomo wants to preserve 965 acres, including the 945 acre Scofield Ridge. Ned Sullivan is president of Poughkeepsie based Scenic Hudson. It is a property that Scenic Hudson acquired in 2018 in the heart of the state park that will provide critical trail links along the ridge overlooking the Hudson River, connecting to Mount Beacon, which has a fire tower that is fun to climb on top, and Breakneck Ridge, which is considered the most popular day hike in America, Sullivan says. It will also connect to over 2,000 acres of land Scenic Hudson protected years ago and transferred to the state along Fishkill Ridge, which is the land towering above the City of Beacon, and it also protects critical drinking water supplies in the area,"" says Sullivan. Michelle Smith is executive director of Hudson Highlands Land Trust. She says providing connectivity and buffers is important. Another example that we worked on was an expansion to Fahnestock, which provides connectivity between Fahnestock State Park and the neighboring Boy Scout Reservation. Smith says. And we would hope, over time, that we could even further expand those connections to other parkland in the area. The proposal would acquire this land in Fahnestock State Park, in Putnam Valley, through a partnership with the Hudson Highlands Land Trust. Another area that was preserved was an area between Schunnemunk State Park on the west side of the Hudson river between Schunnemunk State Park and the Storm King Art Center, says Smith. So yet another connection that is really important both for recreational purposes but also for our wildlife to have these connected corridors to move over time. And that s actually really important also for climate change and climate change adaption strategies. The Democratic governor s proposal includes 808 acres of preservation in Schunnemunk State Park, to permanently protect open space that had been targeted for residential development. The plan would also extend a significant conservation corridor between Black Rock Forest and Schunnemunk Mountain. Democratic New York state Senator James Skoufis s 39th District includes some of the land targeted for preservation. And so this builds on an announcement from a number of years ago that preserved a tremendous amount of acreage in Black Rock Forest in Orange County. And so, look, people look around in the Hudson Valley and they see their farmland, their open space very quickly disappearing before their eyes, Skoufis says. And so any and all efforts that we can take as a state, whether it s supporting local land trusts or ourselves providing funding as a state to preserve the dwindling open space we have is something that I 1,000 percent support. The acquisitions in Cuomo s proposal represent an investment of 20.6 million in state funding from the Environmental Protection Fund and the federal Hudson Highlands Conservation Act. Again, Smith: With all this conservation not only for the wildlife and the recreational experience, but we ve also got to remember that it s really important for water as well as for preserving our water resources like our surface water and our groundwater, Smith says. This addition to protected lands is really going to help sustain our water supplies into the future and obviously has a role not only in keeping our quantity of water sustainable but also our quality of water. Other areas of preservation include 633 acres in Minnewaska State Park Preserve in Ulster County 112 acres in Sterling Forest State Park and one acre in Rockefeller State Park Preserve, as an entry to Rockwood Hall.  $20.6 Million Investment Should Save 4,000 Acres in Hudson Valley Gov.

NY Gov Proposes Mid-Hudson Valley Land Preservation As part of the State of the State address he ll deliver Wednesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo aims to preserve 4,000 acres in the mid Hudson Valley. The land acquisitions would add buffers and trails to seven state parks as well as conserve ecological corridors. These are really true recreational and ecological gems in our region, Sullivan says. One of the seven state parks is Hudson Highlands State Park Preserve, which spans Dutchess and Putnam Counties, and where Cuomo wants to preserve 965 acres, including the 945 acre Scofield Ridge. Ned Sullivan is president of Poughkeepsie based Scenic Hudson. It is a property that Scenic Hudson acquired in 2018 in the heart of the state park that will provide critical trail links along the ridge overlooking the Hudson River, connecting to Mount Beacon, which has a fire tower that is fun to climb on top, and Breakneck Ridge, which is considered the most popular day hike in America, Sullivan says. It will also connect to over 2,000 acres of land Scenic Hudson protected years ago and transferred to the state along Fishkill Ridge, which is the land towering above the City of Beacon, and it also protects critical drinking water supplies in the area,"" says Sullivan. Michelle Smith is executive director of Hudson Highlands Land Trust. She says providing connectivity and buffers is important. Another example that we worked on was an expansion to Fahnestock, which provides connectivity between Fahnestock State Park and the neighboring Boy Scout Reservation. Smith says. And we would hope, over time, that we could even further expand those connections to other parkland in the area. The proposal would acquire this land in Fahnestock State Park, in Putnam Valley, through a partnership with the Hudson Highlands Land Trust. Another area that was preserved was an area between Schunnemunk State Park on the west side of the Hudson river between Schunnemunk State Park and the Storm King Art Center, says Smith. So yet another connection that is really important both for recreational purposes but also for our wildlife to have these connected corridors to move over time. And that s actually really important also for climate change and climate change adaption strategies. The Democratic governor s proposal includes 808 acres of preservation in Schunnemunk State Park, to permanently protect open space that had been targeted for residential development. The plan would also extend a significant conservation corridor between Black Rock Forest and Schunnemunk Mountain. Democratic New York state Senator James Skoufis s 39th District includes some of the land targeted for preservation. And so this builds on an announcement from a number of years ago that preserved a tremendous amount of acreage in Black Rock Forest in Orange County. And so, look, people look around in the Hudson Valley and they see their farmland, their open space very quickly disappearing before their eyes, Skoufis says. And so any and all efforts that we can take as a state, whether it s supporting local land trusts or ourselves providing funding as a state to preserve the dwindling open space we have is something that I 1,000 percent support. The acquisitions in Cuomo s proposal represent an investment of 20.6 million in state funding from the Environmental Protection Fund and the federal Hudson Highlands Conservation Act. Again, Smith: With all this conservation not only for the wildlife and the recreational experience, but we ve also got to remember that it s really important for water as well as for preserving our water resources like our surface water and our groundwater, Smith says. This addition to protected lands is really going to help sustain our water supplies into the future and obviously has a role not only in keeping our quantity of water sustainable but also our quality of water. Other areas of preservation include 633 acres in Minnewaska State Park Preserve in Ulster County 112 acres in Sterling Forest State Park and one acre in Rockefeller State Park Preserve, as an entry to Rockwood Hall.  $20.6 Million Investment Should Save 4,000 Acres in Hudson Valley Gov.

Minnewaska State Park,"Main Course Marketplace will mark 30 years in New Paltz in 2020 Bill Cary For the Poughkeepsie Journal Way before farm to table was trendy, Bruce Kazan was leaning on local Hudson Valley farmers for his restaurant and catering business. In 1990, after testing the waters as a weekender for a year, Kazan launched his dual business, Main Course Catering and Events and Main Course Marketplace in New Paltz. May 4 will mark his 30th anniversary. And he continues to rely on local farms and suppliers as the backbone of his business, now buying from more than 20 CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture farms). NEW IN TOWN: Check out Beacon's HV Food Hall NOW OPEN: Roosevelt Bar in Beacon RESOLVED TO KEEP YOUR RESOLUTIONS? Local pros offer tips All of our food comes from local farms, says Kazan, who lives with his wife, Vicky, in New Paltz. Pretty much everything is made in house daily from scratch. One exception is the breads, which come from Bread Alone Bakery and Eli s Bread in New York. The lunch and dinner specials change daily, Kazan says. Because I don t have a set menu I can play with whatever is in the market. Kazan has accumulated a number of accolades over the years, including being voted Best Caterer in the Hudson Valley more than 25 times by the readers of Hudson Valley Magazine. Since 2008, Kazan has operated his business out of a modern building in a small strip mall on New Paltz s busy Main Street. We stopped in for lunch on a recent weekday and the joint was jumping and everything we tried was quite good. The room is casual and attractive, with no waiters it s counter service only. They call your name when your order is ready. Our food came out in just a few minutes. We re a self serve restaurant that s more in line with takeout prices, Kazan says. We re 30 percent cheaper than a restaurant that does full service. It allows people the freedom to come and go as they please and it allows me to focus on the catering business, which continues to grow about 20 percent a year, he says. Currently, the Main Course business is about 60 percent catering, 40 percent restaurant. There are now a total of 42 employees, Kazan says. Along with corporate retreats, big catering clients include Hudson Valley hospitals and local colleges such as the U. S. Military Academy at West Point. And weddings 40 or so a year continue to be a mainstay. More and more people come up from New York and want to get married up here, Kazan says. So many people in the Hudson Valley are producing so many great foods, he adds. The Hudson Valley has changed so much in the 30 years since we started it has really come into its own. The restaurant s menu is wide ranging and quite appealing. The Composed Salads are large and loaded with fresh and well chosen ingredients. Selections include a Mediterranean Shrimp salad, Pan Asian Raw Kale, a Cobb salad, a mezze plate and a blackened chicken salad. You can also draw up your own chopped salad from a list of 25 ingredients. Sandwiches and paninis served with mixed greens, tabbouleh or potato salad include crisp eggplant, grilled chicken or cheese, meatloaf, smoked turkey and a veggie burger. You can also get a half sandwich with a salad and cup of homemade soup for 10 (there's an up charge for the lobster club or steak). And there are lots of grab and go selections: heat and serve entrees, soups, salads, sandwiches and desserts. Smoothie and juice bar offerings include a Veggie Burst (tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, carrot, celery and spinach) and Green Machine (cucumber, celery, apple, kale, spinach and lemon). There is also an array of prepared salads (kale, grilled veggies or potatoes, beet, cole slaw etc. ) sold by the pound. We sell everything a la carte so people can buy salads to go with their leftovers, Kazan says. We had a lot of that after Thanksgiving. The restaurant can seat about 40 diners at a time, plus there about 20 outdoor seats in warm weather. For a self serve, take out restaurant, there is real silverware and china plates and nothing cheap or annoying. What we tried Lobster Club: We opted for the half sandwich soup and salad option. The sandwich was meaty and tasty, with hunks of fresh lobster topped with an interesting mix of frisee, avocado and smoked salmon bacon on a good roll. Normally, I like my lobster clubs clean and spare, with just mayo and celery, but this worked. We chose one of the daily soup specials, Tuscan Clam and White Bean, which was loaded with clams in a piping hot, flavorful broth. The generous side salad included fresh greens, cucumber, garbanzo beans, carrots and radish. Grilled Hudson Valley Cattle Co. Hanger Steak Sandwich: Again, we went for the half sandwich soup and salad deal. Another winner here the steak was flavorful and perfectly medium rare, topped with caramelized onions and melted cheddar cheese. With this, we opted for a cup of another of the daily soup specials a vegan and spicy Kalabasa (Philippines Pumpkin Soup). Sweets: We took a bunch of desserts home and they were all well presented and quite good pecan chocolate bar, apple cider cake, carrot cake and an outstanding flourless chocolate walnut cookie. Drinks and dessert There are usually 15 to 20 beers available, all from New York state and priced at 5.50. The five or so wines by the glass are also all from New York and priced at 7.50. There is not a full bar, but three specialty cocktails are usually available, priced around 8. The coffee is from Orange County based Noble Coffee Roasters. The homemade desserts, which include cakes, seasonal pies, scones, puddings, tarts and a range of cookies and brownies, are in the 5 range. Who goes Twenty five percent is college related, 25 percent is transient and the balance is people who live in the community, Kazan says. Some people come in three or four times a week. Inside scoop Items on the All Day Menu are available from 11 a. m. to close lunch specials run from 11 a. m. to 4 p. m. and dinner specials from 5 p. m. to close Sunday brunch runs from 9 a. m. to 3 p. m. What we will order next One of the composed salads What s nearby If the weather is decent, lots of hiking and biking trails are close at hand, including the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail, Minnewaska State Park Preserve and the Mohonk Preserve.

NY Gov Proposes Mid-Hudson Valley Land Preservation As part of the State of the State address he ll deliver Wednesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo aims to preserve 4,000 acres in the mid Hudson Valley. The land acquisitions would add buffers and trails to seven state parks as well as conserve ecological corridors. These are really true recreational and ecological gems in our region, Sullivan says. One of the seven state parks is Hudson Highlands State Park Preserve, which spans Dutchess and Putnam Counties, and where Cuomo wants to preserve 965 acres, including the 945 acre Scofield Ridge. Ned Sullivan is president of Poughkeepsie based Scenic Hudson. It is a property that Scenic Hudson acquired in 2018 in the heart of the state park that will provide critical trail links along the ridge overlooking the Hudson River, connecting to Mount Beacon, which has a fire tower that is fun to climb on top, and Breakneck Ridge, which is considered the most popular day hike in America, Sullivan says. It will also connect to over 2,000 acres of land Scenic Hudson protected years ago and transferred to the state along Fishkill Ridge, which is the land towering above the City of Beacon, and it also protects critical drinking water supplies in the area,"" says Sullivan. Michelle Smith is executive director of Hudson Highlands Land Trust. She says providing connectivity and buffers is important. Another example that we worked on was an expansion to Fahnestock, which provides connectivity between Fahnestock State Park and the neighboring Boy Scout Reservation. Smith says. And we would hope, over time, that we could even further expand those connections to other parkland in the area. The proposal would acquire this land in Fahnestock State Park, in Putnam Valley, through a partnership with the Hudson Highlands Land Trust. Another area that was preserved was an area between Schunnemunk State Park on the west side of the Hudson river between Schunnemunk State Park and the Storm King Art Center, says Smith. So yet another connection that is really important both for recreational purposes but also for our wildlife to have these connected corridors to move over time. And that s actually really important also for climate change and climate change adaption strategies. The Democratic governor s proposal includes 808 acres of preservation in Schunnemunk State Park, to permanently protect open space that had been targeted for residential development. The plan would also extend a significant conservation corridor between Black Rock Forest and Schunnemunk Mountain. Democratic New York state Senator James Skoufis s 39th District includes some of the land targeted for preservation. And so this builds on an announcement from a number of years ago that preserved a tremendous amount of acreage in Black Rock Forest in Orange County. And so, look, people look around in the Hudson Valley and they see their farmland, their open space very quickly disappearing before their eyes, Skoufis says. And so any and all efforts that we can take as a state, whether it s supporting local land trusts or ourselves providing funding as a state to preserve the dwindling open space we have is something that I 1,000 percent support. The acquisitions in Cuomo s proposal represent an investment of 20.6 million in state funding from the Environmental Protection Fund and the federal Hudson Highlands Conservation Act. Again, Smith: With all this conservation not only for the wildlife and the recreational experience, but we ve also got to remember that it s really important for water as well as for preserving our water resources like our surface water and our groundwater, Smith says. This addition to protected lands is really going to help sustain our water supplies into the future and obviously has a role not only in keeping our quantity of water sustainable but also our quality of water. Other areas of preservation include 633 acres in Minnewaska State Park Preserve in Ulster County 112 acres in Sterling Forest State Park and one acre in Rockefeller State Park Preserve, as an entry to Rockwood Hall.  $20.6 Million Investment Should Save 4,000 Acres in Hudson Valley Gov.

NY Gov Proposes Mid-Hudson Valley Land Preservation As part of the State of the State address he ll deliver Wednesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo aims to preserve 4,000 acres in the mid Hudson Valley. The land acquisitions would add buffers and trails to seven state parks as well as conserve ecological corridors. These are really true recreational and ecological gems in our region, Sullivan says. One of the seven state parks is Hudson Highlands State Park Preserve, which spans Dutchess and Putnam Counties, and where Cuomo wants to preserve 965 acres, including the 945 acre Scofield Ridge. Ned Sullivan is president of Poughkeepsie based Scenic Hudson. It is a property that Scenic Hudson acquired in 2018 in the heart of the state park that will provide critical trail links along the ridge overlooking the Hudson River, connecting to Mount Beacon, which has a fire tower that is fun to climb on top, and Breakneck Ridge, which is considered the most popular day hike in America, Sullivan says. It will also connect to over 2,000 acres of land Scenic Hudson protected years ago and transferred to the state along Fishkill Ridge, which is the land towering above the City of Beacon, and it also protects critical drinking water supplies in the area,"" says Sullivan. Michelle Smith is executive director of Hudson Highlands Land Trust. She says providing connectivity and buffers is important. Another example that we worked on was an expansion to Fahnestock, which provides connectivity between Fahnestock State Park and the neighboring Boy Scout Reservation. Smith says. And we would hope, over time, that we could even further expand those connections to other parkland in the area. The proposal would acquire this land in Fahnestock State Park, in Putnam Valley, through a partnership with the Hudson Highlands Land Trust. Another area that was preserved was an area between Schunnemunk State Park on the west side of the Hudson river between Schunnemunk State Park and the Storm King Art Center, says Smith. So yet another connection that is really important both for recreational purposes but also for our wildlife to have these connected corridors to move over time. And that s actually really important also for climate change and climate change adaption strategies. The Democratic governor s proposal includes 808 acres of preservation in Schunnemunk State Park, to permanently protect open space that had been targeted for residential development. The plan would also extend a significant conservation corridor between Black Rock Forest and Schunnemunk Mountain. Democratic New York state Senator James Skoufis s 39th District includes some of the land targeted for preservation. And so this builds on an announcement from a number of years ago that preserved a tremendous amount of acreage in Black Rock Forest in Orange County. And so, look, people look around in the Hudson Valley and they see their farmland, their open space very quickly disappearing before their eyes, Skoufis says. And so any and all efforts that we can take as a state, whether it s supporting local land trusts or ourselves providing funding as a state to preserve the dwindling open space we have is something that I 1,000 percent support. The acquisitions in Cuomo s proposal represent an investment of 20.6 million in state funding from the Environmental Protection Fund and the federal Hudson Highlands Conservation Act. Again, Smith: With all this conservation not only for the wildlife and the recreational experience, but we ve also got to remember that it s really important for water as well as for preserving our water resources like our surface water and our groundwater, Smith says. This addition to protected lands is really going to help sustain our water supplies into the future and obviously has a role not only in keeping our quantity of water sustainable but also our quality of water. Other areas of preservation include 633 acres in Minnewaska State Park Preserve in Ulster County 112 acres in Sterling Forest State Park and one acre in Rockefeller State Park Preserve, as an entry to Rockwood Hall.  $20.6 Million Investment Should Save 4,000 Acres in Hudson Valley Gov.

Orange County Land Trust purchase protects wildlife sanctuary Judy Rife judyrife verizon. net The Orange County Land Trust has purchased another 73 acres of forest to protect a wildlife sanctuary near Greenwood Lake and, at the same time, preserved a property with a rich history. The purchase, from Jeffrey Sapanaro of Greenwood Lake, brings the Land Trust s holdings next to the Doris Duke Wildlife Sanctuary in Sterling Forest State Park to 247 acres. The price wasn t disclosed, but the Land Trust paid 85,000 for an adjacent tract of 57 acres in 2017. The property has tremendous conservation value water quality, biodiversity, recreation and climate resilience, so protecting it was a natural priority for us, said Jim Delaune, the Land Trust s executive director, in a statement. Delaune added that his staff soon discovered the property had figured in the work of Jasper Cropsey, an artist of the Hudson River School, in the mid 1800s as well as in the development of Greenwood Forest Farms, the state s first African American resort community, in the early 1900s. Helping to preserve some local history was just icing on the cake, Delaune said. Cropsey, who married a Town of Warwick woman and lived in Warwick for a time, painted numerous views of Greenwood Lake including one that is believed to be from an outlook on this property. The painting is now part of the collection at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. In addition, the property was part of a larger tract where prominent black families from Harlem and Brooklyn established a vacation community that drew many cultural and civil rights leaders. Some descendants of the original families still have homes at Greenwood Forest Farms and observed the association s 100th anniversary last year. Gordon Duncan, a third generation homeowner, said in a statement that the Land Trust s action will forever perpetuate the legacy of the community. Delaune said the property has been a preservation priority for the town, county and state for years and its acquisition serves multiple goals the protection of Greenwood Lake s water quality and watershed chief among them. The property is open to the public and can be accessed through state park lands. The Land Trust plans to schedule a guided hike to the overlook that inspired Cropsey in the spring. Information about the hike will be posted at oclt. org and on Facebook as soon as it is available. judyrife gmail. com Land Trust protects 73-acre property near Greenwood Lake The Orange County Land Trust has announced the protection of 73 acres of forest near Greenwood Lake in the Town of Warwick, a property that also boasts a unique history where an icon of the Harlem Renaissance and a Hudson River School artist drew inspiration. This project by the Land Trust is part of an ongoing effort to protect habitat buffering the Doris Duke Wildlife Sanctuary section of Sterling Forest State Park. Since 2017, the Land Trust has protected three individual properties comprising 247 acres bordering the State Park. According to Executive Director Jim Delaune, the 73 acre property initially caught the attention of the Land Trust as a potential buffer to Sterling Forest State Park, but as the organization began taking a closer look at the property s history as part of their due diligence, their interest grew exponentially. The property has tremendous conservation value: water quality, biodiversity, recreation and climate resilience, so protecting it was a natural priority for us,"" Delaune said. ""Then, we came across the Jasper Cropsey connection, and not long after that, we learned that the land was once part of Greenwood Forest Farms, the first African American resort community in New York State. Helping to preserve some local history,"" Delaune added, ""was just icing on the cake. "" Site of a Hudson River School Painting During the initial site visit to the property, Land Trust staff members made their way to a rocky overlook facing Greenwood Lake to the south. Conservation Project Manager Shanna Abeles, who has a background in fine art, noted the view s similarity to a painting by Hudson River School artist Jasper Cropsey. After comparing the views from a few possible locations, we were convinced that this was the site from which Cropsey painted his 1845 work, View of Greenwood Lake, New Jersey, Abeles said. Greenwood Forest Farms Nearly 75 years after the completion of Cropsey s Greenwood Lake piece, the property continued playing a role in the fabric of local culture. The parcel was once part of a larger tract known as Greenwood Forest Farms, which was formed in 1919 by prominent black families from Harlem and Brooklyn. The vacation community was a haven for cultural and civil rights leaders. Among some of the notable figures to have lived or vacationed at the colony was poet and Harlem Renaissance icon, Langston Hughes, and the first black New York Police Department officer, Samuel Battle. Last year marked the 100th anniversary of Greenwood Forest Farms, where descendants of the original families continue to have homes to this day.

the Orange County Land Trust, said Gordon Duncan, including hemlock northern hardwood and Appalachian oak hickory forests. The property also contains a stream and potential habitat for the Dragon s Mouth Orchid, a threatened vascular plant. The protection of this property also achieves the goals of public conservation planning documents. The Town of Warwick s Community Preservation Project Plan identified this property as a priority for the protection of the water quality of Greenwood Lake. The Orange County Open Space Plan identified the property and surrounding area as a biological hot spot, with high value for biological diversity. The Orange County Department of Planning assisted in protecting this property by funding some of the Land Trust s costs to complete the project, including an updated survey. We are proud of our longstanding partnership with the Land Trust, said David Church, Commissioner of Planning. Over the years we have worked together on the preservation of thousands of acres of open space and farmland, and we look forward to continuing this work for the benefit of county residents long into the future. According to Director of Conservation and Stewardship Matt Decker, the newly protected land is now accessible to the public: Hikers from neighboring State Park lands can visit this property and take in the same spectacular views of Greenwood Lake that inspired Jasper Cropsey. The Land Trust hopes to schedule a guided hike to the scenic overlook this spring. That information will be posted on the organization s website and Facebook page. The project was made possible because of the Peter and Carmen Lucia Buck Foundation, the Janet Ross Fund, the Orange County Department of Planning, and supporters of the Orange County Land Trust. The Orange County Land Trust is dedicated to conserving Orange County's watersheds, agricultural lands, and diverse habitats through conservation agreements with willing landowners.

Leestown Center Way,"Two more REAL ID regional licensing offices opening in Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Secretary of Transportation Jim Gray gave an update on Wednesday about Kentucky's REAL ID program. The deadline for Kentucky to comply with the federal REAL ID Act is in October. The two announced a new project manager dedicated to making sure Kentuckians have compliant IDs. Sarah Jackson will serve in the transportation cabinet and report directly to Secretary Gray. After years of delays, Kentucky chose to distribute REAL ID compliant driver's licenses through 12 regional offices. Right now, only two regional offices are open in Frankfort and Bowling Green. Gov. Beshear announced Paducah and Somerset would be the next cities to offer REAL ID licenses. Each office will initially have one station but will expand capacity in the coming months to serve Kentuckians throughout the region. There are plans to open an office in Lexington. The legislature's Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee approved money to rent office space on Leestown Center Way in Lexington. But the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet says the lease is not final.

Kilbourntown,"The Oldest Home in Wauwatosa Now Has New Owners After almost eight decades as a Milwaukee County historical site, the 175 year old Lowell Damon House is under private ownership. I t started out as a carpenter s home in a frontier settlement. Almost a century later, it became a history museum in a growing suburb. Now the curtain could be rising on a third act for Wauwatosa s oldest home. The Milwaukee County Historical Society has sold the 175 year old Lowell Damon House, 2107 N. Wauwatosa Ave. , to neighbors William and Jennifer Hoag, for about 100,000. The Hoags didn t return calls seeking comment on their plans. However, a historic preservation easement in the deed will require the county society to approve any major changes to the house, says Mame Croze McCully, the society s executive director. Although the society had operated the house as a museum since the early 1940s, the building was costly to maintain, Croze McCully says. The county society offered to donate it to the Wauwatosa Historical Society (which operates the Kneeland Walker House and the Little Red Store), the namesake Damon Woods Neighborhood Association and the City of Wauwatosa, but none of them was prepared to take it on, Croze McCully says. That led the county society to seek a private buyer who was willing to restore the house, she says. The deal closed in November. We looked at what was best for the long term preservation of the Lowell Damon House, Croze McCully says. The house s story started in 1844 four years before Wisconsin became a state when carpenter Oliver Damon moved from New Hampshire and built the first part of his new home. He used oak and black walnut trees from the local forest, according to the National Park Service s 1935 Historic American Buildings Survey. Two years later, Damon and/or his son, Lowell historians aren t certain who added the more elaborate front part of the house. Its architecture generally follows a Colonial style that may have been inspired by Oliver Damon s native New England, but with Greek Revival touches, the parks service survey said. By 1935, the house was already deteriorating and seemed likely to face demolition soon, the parks service reported. But the sons of former owner Alexander Rogers were determined to save the home where they grew up, according to an article in the Wauwatosa Historical Society s newsletter. The Rogers brothers bought the building and donated it to the county historical society in 1941. For most of the next 78 years, a local history museum occupied the front part of the house, while a caretaker lived in back, looking after the home in exchange for reduced rent, Croze McCully says. In 2010, the historical society joined forces with the neighborhood association to revitalize the property. Volunteers gave the house its first new paint job in at least 12 years. The association also installed a 204 brick path behind the house and offered neighbors a chance to pay for engraving a brick in honor of a current or deceased resident part of the proceeds went to the upkeep of the house and the rest to the association s programs. Contributions from the association helped supplement revenue from the caretaker s rent and the suggested 2 donations from the few visitors who toured the house on Sunday afternoons, but that wasn t enough to offset maintenance costs, Croze McCully says. The society spent 15,000 to 18,000 last year on short term repairs alone, without addressing long term issues, she says. With the sale of the Lowell Damon House, Croze McCully said, the society will be able to focus more on the other historic properties it operates, including its main museum in a former bank building in downtown Milwaukee, Kilbourntown House in Estabrook Park in Shorewood, and Trimborn Farms and the Jeremiah Curtin House, both in Greendale. The society owns the Curtin House, while the county owns the other three sites. Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn Reddit Email Comments comments City Streets: Custer’s Last Stand in Milwaukee There s still a city street that honors him. Or is it named after a Town of Granville settler? Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee Who was Custer Avenue named for? Was it an early Town of Granville settler named Harvey Custer or United States Army cavalry leader George Armstrong Custer? According to the first edition of Our Roots Grow Deep, the 1943 publication of the Superintendent of Milwaukee Public Schools, Custer High School, like other city public schools was named according to the streets upon which they are located. Consequently, the publication continues, the school was named for George Custer, famous cavalry leader. (Note: A new Custer High School was later built nearby on N. Sherman Boulevard). The second edition of the publication, printed in 1974, gives a different explanation. The original school located at N. 37th and W. Custer Avenue, the latter reportedly named after an early North Milwaukee settler, Harvey Custer. So, which edition of Our Roots Grow Deep was correct about the street s roots? Milwaukee County Register of Deeds records show the street was initially named in Payne s Addition, a subdivision planned in 1892. It included new streets named Sheridan, Wallace, Hammond, and Custer. There are often patterns to the naming of streets in new developments. Byron Kilbourn and his associates named many of the streets in Kilbourntown for trees. Only Walnut and Cherry streets survive, but there were others. Poplar (now W. McKinley Avenue), Chestnut (W. Juneau Avenue), Tamarack (W. State Street), Cedar (W. Kilbourn Avenue), and Sycamore (W. Michigan Street), are all gone but were part of the tree naming pattern. For example,and his associates named many of the streets in Kilbourntown for trees. Only Walnut and Cherry streets survive, but there were others. Poplar (now W. McKinley Avenue), Chestnut (W. Juneau Avenue), Tamarack (W. State Street), Cedar (W. Kilbourn Avenue), and Sycamore (W. Michigan Street), are all gone but were part of the tree naming pattern. Solomon Juneau named streets in Juneautown for national and regional political figures including Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John Marshall, Lewis Cass, and Stevens Thomson Mason. The pattern in Henry Clay Payne s development was Union Army military figures during the Civil War. Sheridan Avenue is undoubtedly named for Civil War hero General Philip Sheridan. General Lew Wallace, who gained fame after the war as the author of the novel Ben Hur, was likely the inspiration for the naming of Wallace Avenue. Hammond Avenue was probably a tribute to William Alexander Hammond, the Surgeon General of the army during the war and the founder of the Army Medical Museum. Major General George Armstrong Custer, another Civil War hero, was unquestionably honored with the naming of Custer Avenue. Wallace and Hammond avenues were eventually renamed but Sheridan and Custer avenues still exist. So, what about Harvey Custer? Well, there never was a Harvey Custer. Harvey Carter, according to the Town of Granville, Clerks Records and Minutes, was elected constable of the township in 1842. The Illustrated Historical Atlas of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin later misspelled Carter s name as Custer when listing the men elected as the first officials of the Town of Granville. This misspelling gave rise to the Harvey Custer myth. Harvey Carter s existence was substantiated in Granville census listings of 1840, 1842, and 1846. He was also elected to other positions in the town in 1844 and 1846. There are no entries for a Harvey Custer in any of these sources. So why was there a desire to attribute the street name to a single mention of a Custer that was not supported by any other records? The answer is that George Armstrong Custer was a documented bigot. It was not politically correct that a school, particularly one with a high percentage of African Americans, had been named for a man, who, according to his biographer, Robert Utley, was not in favor of recruiting blacks into the military, judging shovels and hoes as more fitting for them than muskets. Further, when Custer requested a commission, he specifically requested that he not be given a black unit. Regarding black suffrage, Custer said, I should as soon think of elevating an Indian chief to the popedom of Rome. The whole issue of who Custer High School was named for became moot in 2011 when the school s name was changed to Milwaukee Campus for Trades, Technology and Media. It was later changed again and is now known as the Barack Obama School of Career and Technical Education. After his heroic service in the Civil War, George Armstrong Custer s name became even more well known with his defeat and death at the hands of the combined forces of three American Indian tribes at the Battle of Little Bighorn in the Montana Territory in 1876, known today as Custer s Last Stand. There is no doubt that the mostly residential W. Custer Avenue, which runs between N. 13th and N. 106th streets at 5400 north, was named for George Armstrong Custer and not an imaginary Harvey Custer.

El Dorado Trail,"Camping ordinance passed  Placerville City Council tackles homelessness woes It s now the law of the land, at least as far as Placerville is concerned: By giving the homeless three options regarding where they may pitch a tent when local church shelters or any other shelters are not available, the City Council is hoping that camping along trails, in city parks and other public property will cease to be a problem. An ordinance intended to keep residents safe, not having to deal with, for example, someone sleeping alongside the El Dorado Trail as the family goes for a Sunday stroll, not fearing children will stumble upon used hypodermic needles as they play ball at Rotary Park, was unanimously approved Jan. 14. The Camping on Public Property ordinance, which actually was an amendment to the city s 2014 ordinance, originally was presented as a law that would prohibit any camping whatsoever on city property at any time, giving Placerville police a tool to use in enforcing their response to calls regarding problem transients. Drifters and other homeless who throw up impromptu campsites in areas where fire danger is a risk, building campfires to heat food, leave unsanitary garbage in their wake and create other hazardous situations prompted the City Council to try to beef up the rules. But before the ordinance could be passed last fall, the council, upon learning of a recent decision favoring homeless plaintiffs in a case out of Boise, Idaho, ordered the law to be rewritten to allow limited camping on city property instead of outlawing homeless campers outright. (Three locations have been selected: lower Main Street, Broadway and off Highway 193 just north of the city). But the new ordinance, the council was told at last week s meeting by an activist for the homeless, still is illegal and doesn t comply with the federal appellate court decision that states, simply, that those camping on public lands may not be cited or arrested or even told to move on, not unless there is a shelter with an available bed located nearby. By designating three areas where camping may occur without worrying about a visit from police, City Attorney John Driscoll told the council he thinks the city is on firm footing, within the parameters of the Boise decision. Police Chief James Ortega, who prepared a report for the council s perusal Tuesday, reminded the crowd at Town Hall that new law was never intended to be an ordinance to arrest the homeless. It is, instead, a way for the police to help make Placerville residents feel safe and to try not to have our city destroyed, he said. These (homeless) camps have no restroom facilities or refuse pick up, which creates a major public health concern for not only the occupants of the camps, but the public as well, Ortega states in his report. Due to the conditions various pests are attracted which increases the likelihood of the spread of sickness and disease. Substance abuse problems often plague the homeless, the police chief pointed out, and the dangers of the campsites include a pronounced criminal element. Many of the subjects have active warrants sex registration offenses and attempt to abscond from parole and or probation. As a result the camps can be dangerous for those living in them Ortega has said at past council meetings that the police wish to protect not only the residents of the city, but to provide help to the homeless who are being victimized by the darker element. Council members also heard from advocates for the homeless, including one man who for years has helped run the area s nomadic shelter that on a limited basis offers a place to sleep at local churches. Don Vanderkar told the panel he would hope the city would not merely pass a new law regulating camping, but try to do something to help the homeless find a way out of their plight. In the 10 years I have been working with homeless people, I have learned that the first thing they need is a safe place to stay where they re not constantly focused on survival, said Vanderkar, prior to discussion on the camping ordinance. The 40 year Placerville resident said the homeless often huddle through the cold night, in an icy hovel where they fear being robbed and raped. The speaker said the problem is growing nationwide and added that if government officials don t take steps to address the issue, local churches and volunteers simply won t be enough to deal with the situation. Local public agencies have not acted, charged Vanderkar. Local churches and volunteers are working very hard to do what you are not doing. Vanderkar added that he hadn t heard the city taking any action regarding the Armory, referring to an abandoned structure that sits off Ray Lawyer Drive near the El Dorado County Fairgrounds that several residents have opined would make a good homeless shelter. And the seemingly tireless Vanderkar, whose letters to the editor have run in the Mountain Democrat for years regarding helping the homeless, said he would hope city officials will remember the success of Hangtown Haven. That legally organized campground that began in July of 2012 housed a homeless population along Broadway, and was lauded as a marked success. Some contended it was too successful, however, alleging that the experimental campground was attracting homeless from outside the area and not serving only the local populace. Hangtown Haven was shut down in November of 2013 when the City Council denied its request for an extension of the temporary order allowing its existence. Despite its success at providing a stable locale where those down on their luck could take advantage of programs and opportunities, with several success stories resulting, complaints from neighbors and from the police at that time swayed the council to close down the camp (the council did allow one extension, but said no to a second). County officials then were approached regarding providing an alternative site that did not materialize. Hangtown Haven Inc. still exists, advised Vanderkar, and would be willing to work with the city on resurrecting such a venture, he indicated. The longtime champion for the homeless then delivered an apology, saying he may have been a bit harsh in making his points. I am known to be a soft spoken, kind and politically correct person, he began. However, I am tired, having volunteered (recently) at the nomadic shelter, which makes me more sarcastic than usual. But over the past 10 years many homeless have died in this city we have had memorial services for them, he continued. Perhaps the city could help us with those memorial services. City officials assured Vanderkar and the crowd that the possibility of turning the Armory into a shelter for the homeless has been examined, but at this point it seems more logical to eye the site for construction of affordable housing, a longer term answer to a problem that is growing every day. City staff has been working on procuring grants and other funding mechanisms that would advance such a project there, and in fact city officials said they have met with two developers who are interested in the site. Another speaker who often takes the podium to advocate for the homeless, Jonathan Gainsbrugh, told the council that the camping ordinance they were primed to pass still remains illegal, in his opinion. Gainsbrugh said designating three areas where camping may occur, when there are no shelters available, does not make the city compliant with the Boise decision. Despite its micro changes, (the ordinance) continues to illegally restrict hours and locations for the homeless to be, said Gainsbrugh, who added that changing the language to allow camping from sundown to 8 a. m. (formerly it was 8 p. m. to 8 a. m. ) does not do the trick either. (The city s ordinance) is not only unworkable, but totally contrary to the 9th District Federal Court s decision regarding criminalizing and criminally restricting homeless persons camping and activities, said Gainsbrugh. It does not matter what the city attorney s opinion on the matter is. During last week s meeting the council authorized the city to continue to contribute to the funding of a countywide homeless coordination effort, approving 10,000 to go into a pot that pays for the services of HomeBase, a private company, among other irons in the fire. The city entered into an agreement in 2018 with the county to contribute a share and the county asked that city funding be provided again this year. Council members stressed that the city is pushing forward with efforts to come up with solutions to the vexing problems presented by the homeless, although it is admittedly slow going. It is a painfully slow process that we have to go through to get more money, said Councilman Dennis Thomas. But it s what we need to do it will pay off eventually. Thomas said efforts by law enforcement, including the Homeless Outreach Team have been very successful, but that it s not overly apparent to most that progress is being made, especially when the homeless are visibly growing in number around them. Not seeing any diminishing in that reality and not seeing a shelter open its doors to house those in dire need, leaves them wondering what is being done, he pointed out.  More recreation trails? Local advocates say ‘yes please’ This slideshow requires JavaScript. I believe by working together we will be able to make this region a world class destination for mountain biking and other trail use. Ethan Koenigs, director for the Mother Lode Trail Stewardship Whether it be boating down the South Fork of the American River or hiking in the scenic Sierra, El Dorado County is a mecca for outdoor enthusiasts. A trailblazing organization, the newly formed Mother Lode Trail Stewardship, is seeking to create, maintain and enhance sustainable recreational trails in the county for even more recreational opportunities and as a result assist the local economy. Headed by Shingle Springs resident Ethan Koenigs, MLTS mission is to build trails inclusively for mountain bikers, hikers, runners and horseback riders with an emphasis on connecting trails to community centers. The group has the notion that trail users will take advantage of local shops, eateries and drinking establishments in the county. Having a robust recreational trail system connected to the community I believe will benefit local businesses, said Koenigs, an environmental project manager with SMUD. Trail users will inevitably spend money at small businesses in the county if they can gain access to them beyond driving. Originally called Mother Lode Mountain Biking, Koenigs, also an avid hiker, and other MLTS leaders decided to change the organization s name once they realized a more inclusive approach could gain broader support locally. The trail advocates wish to create a community connected by paths that has features all users can enjoy. A bigger tent of members means more benefit to the community and will increase our ability to raise funds, Koenigs said. Another MLTS goal, becoming a chapter of the International Mountain Bike Association, will allow it to take advantage of a larger pool of resources for education, promotions and membership acquisition. The region currently has two other mountain bike advocacy groups, Tahoe Area Mountain Bike Association and Folsom Auburn Trail Riding Action Coalition, that have geographic overlap. MLTS focus will be on the West Slope of EDC along the Highway 50 and 49 corridors. One new trail planned in the area will be a 12 to 15 mile mountain bike trail between Ice House and Union Valley reservoirs along with other recreational facilities as part of SMUD s new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license agreement to operate its hydroelectric facility in the Crystal Basin Recreation Area of the Eldorado National Forest. The new trail in the Ice House Reservoir area will be a major new recreation feature for mountain bikers looking for something new that is built and designed professionally, Koenigs explained. Koenigs said MLTS also has particular interest in developing the Cronan Ranch area and connecting Coloma and Lotus. That area is already a mecca because of the amazing whitewater rafting, Koenigs said. Why not build off of that and have amazing trails that people can use year round and help some of the businesses that suffer in the whitewater off season. MLTS members also see potential for new trails in the Sly Park area and El Dorado Hills where Koenigs said there is a fair amount of open space with a large population hungry for new trail experiences. Other areas on the group s radar include the new Marble Valley development south of Highway 50 near Cameron Park and improving a terrific network of trails on the Georgetown Divide. The MLTS is very interested in helping the design of the Marble Valley area because there s potential for connection to the town center in El Dorado Hills, Koenigs said. The El Dorado Trail is already serving as a connector and it could be further developed to support a diversity of uses and eventually a network of new trails could connect to that. A turning point came for Koenigs on undertaking the trailblazing effort during a visit to Bentonville, Ark. , in 2019 where he witnessed first hand how much the city invested in trails. The whole community in Bentonville got on board with the concept after they built a few really cool trails that connected right into their downtown area, said Koenigs. As a result they saw the tremendous benefit to local businesses, overall community health and more. Word spread quickly and it snow balled into the city reaping huge economic rewards as it is now a world class destination for mountain bikers. Koenigs said MLTS will seek out grants and raise funds through events and local business sponsors, but the only way this works is if they get buy in from the trail using public with a willingness to serve and volunteer their time to help. MLTS is holding its next meeting Thursday, Jan. 30 at 6:30 p. m. at Solid Ground Brewery in Diamond Springs.

Whitehall Township,"‘Get ready to be deported.’ Former KidsPeace workers sue over discrimination complaints. Three former mental health technicians at KidsPeace say they were given racist nicknames and subjected to workplace discrimination. When they complained about it, they were fired, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court. Ashley Gonzalez said a co worker once told her to stop speaking Spanish or to get ready to be deported because Trump is in office,"" the lawsuit says. She filed the lawsuit along with Janette Gonzalez and Dusean Littlejohn. Ashley Gonzalez and LIttlejohn share the same Allentown address. Janette Gonzalez also lives in Allentown. The Gonzalezes are of Puerto Rican descent and Littlejohn is black, the lawsuit says. According to the lawsuit, Janette Gonzalez asked a supervisor for help with a tax form and was told all you Puerto Ricans have trouble with your money. Littlejohn said he was known at work as the big black guy. The Gonzalezes were known as the two Spanish girls from New York"" and the Gonzalez twins even though they re not related, the lawsuit says. All three of them complained to the human resources department but no investigation was initiated, the lawsuit says. Each of the three was asked to provide insight into their workplace experiences during a training session, the lawsuit says. When they gave honest feedback, they were sent home after lunch, suspended and later fired, the lawsuit says. KidsPeace spokesman Robert Martin said his nonprofit is an equal opportunity employer that promotes workforce diversity in an environment free from racism, bigotry or discrimination. We believe the claims made by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit are without merit and we will vigorously defend ourselves against these allegations. Beyond that, we do not comment on specifics of pending litigation, Martin said. Philadelphia attorneys Charles L. Shute Jr. and Thomas T. Hearn represent KidsPeace in the lawsuit, according to online court records. KidsPeace in North Whitehall Township is a private charity serving the behavioral and mental health needs of children and their families, according to the organization s website. It was founded in 1882. Littlejohn was hired by KidsPeace in January 2014, the lawsuit says. Janette Gonzalez was hired in February 2014. Ashley Gonzalez was hired in December 2015. Each was fired in October 2018, the lawsuit says. A U. S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission investigation on behalf of the three was inconclusive, but the commission notified each plaintiff of their right to sue KidsPeace, according to court records. The lawsuit was filed in October 2019 by attorney Robert H. Graff of Philadelphia. A pretrial conference to discuss the case is scheduled for February with U. S. District Court Judge Chad F. Kenney in Philadelphia. Rudy Miller may be reached at rmiller lehighvalleylive. com. Follow him on Twitter RudyMillerLV. Find Easton area news on Facebook.  What does 2020 have in store for the Lehigh Valley? A key role in the presidential race, some big trials and a giant wild card. March could bring several high profile trials to the region. In Lehigh County, a jury is scheduled to decide the fate of former South Whitehall Township police officer Jonathan Roselle, who has pleaded not guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed New Jersey man on July 28, 2018. Roselle encountered 44 year old Joseph Santos after a woman pulled up beside his police cruiser on Hamilton Boulevard to report that a man tried to enter her car, court documents say. Dashcam and other video shows Santos pounding on the hood of Roselle s SUV and passenger side window, then walking away before reversing course and walking toward Roselle, who at this point was out of the car, gun drawn, commanding Santos to get on the ground. Five shots rang out as Santos collapsed.  Tag: South Whitehall Township – NBC10 Philadelphia A police officer has lost his job after being charged with voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a man reported to have been hanging on or jumping on moving cars near an eastern Pennsylvania amusement park.  Allentown mother accused of putting newborn baby in paint can will go to trial EMBED More News Videos Allentown mother charged in death of infant found in paint can. Walter Perez has more on Action News at 4 p. m. on June 19, 2019. ALLENTOWN, Pennsylvania (WPVI) A woman charged with killing her newborn back in 2017 will go on trial in March. A judge made that decision regarding Ashley Caraballo on Wednesday. Caraballo is accused of giving birth to a baby boy at her Allentown home, then wrapping him in a sheet and placing him inside a backpack, that was hidden inside a five gallon paint can. Caraballo originally went to the hospital for stomach pain and bleeding. During treatment, the attending physician found evidence that Caraballo had recently given birth including placental tissue, a portion of the umbilical cord and specific internal injuries. ""Injuries to the cervix in conjunction to injuries to the umbilical cord were consistent with damage, according to Dr. Avellini, which would occur where a baby was ripped out from a cervix that was not fully dilated,"" said Lehigh County DA Jim Martin back in June. Caraballo denied she had been pregnant. Hospital officials contacted the authorities, and the ensuing investigation led police to the North Whitehall Township home Caraballo shared with her partner and their five children. Citing the medical examiner's report, Martin says, ""Within a reasonable degree of medical certainty the baby was born alive and that the cause of death was one or a combination of asphyxia, blood loss and/or hypothermia. ""Martin says police found a deceased male baby wrapped in a sheet inside a backpack within a five gallon paint can in the basement. She was charged with criminal homicide.  Suspect in weed deal turned double homicide arrested in the Lehigh Valley A third suspect facing homicide charges in a double killing last month in Monroe County is in custody, authorities said. The U. S. Marshals Service announced the arrest Wednesday of Zaire Unique Burkett, 20, of Whitehall Township. He is in custody, charged with two counts of homicide and related charges, along with Deani A. Powell, 20, of Easton and Matthew J. Burke, 21, of East Stroudsburg. A fourth suspect also faces homicide and related charges in the incident, but was not shown to be in custody as of Friday afternoon. He is identified in court records as Harrith Saleem Brown, 23, of Fredericksburg, Virginia. Eric D. Gulley, 41, of Allentown, is charged in the investigation with a weapons offense and hindering apprehension and has been released on 50,000 unsecured bail pending a preliminary hearing set for Feb. 14, court records show. He allegedly helped hide a revolver used by Burke in the incident. Burkett, Powell and Burke are all being held in prison without the possibility of bail. Fatally shot during the robbery Dec. 4 at a home in the 1700 block of Silver Maple Road in Chestnuthill Township were 22 year old Dylan Beinert and 23 year old Khalil Durante. Durante's father, Walter Durante, was critically wounded in the gunfire. The suspects planned to rob Beinert after Powell arranged through social media to buy marijuana from him, according to Pennsylvania State Police at Fern Ridge. After she met with Beinert then left to get her wallet, three armed men went inside the home while Powell waited outside in her car, authorities said. A struggle ensued and Burke shot Beinert and Khalil Durante, authorities allege. Beinert appeared lifeless and Khalil Durante was spitting blood but alive, police said. Burke then shot Khalil Durante in the head and shot Walter Durante, who had screamed and reached for a gun, investigators said. Powell and Burke both reportedly confessed to their roles in interviews with police. A district judge sent all charges against them to Monroe County Court, following their preliminary hearings held to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations. The next step for them is formal arraignment. Burkett s preliminary hearing is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 7 before District Judge Brian Germano. He was arrested about 6 a. m. Wednesday after members of the U. S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force served an arrest warrant at a home in the 700 block of South Eighth Street in Allentown and took him into custody without incident, the Marshals Service said in a news release. Burkett was arraigned Friday afternoon, court records show. U. S. Marshal Martin J. Pane announced the arrest, stating: It s the Marshals Services duty to ensure that those charged with violent crimes have their day in court. It is my sincere hope that the victim s family will find some measure of comfort knowing the suspect will face justice. Kurt Bresswein may be reached at kbresswein lehighvalleylive. com.

Great Lakes Fresh Market in North Muskegon is fourth to close in West Michigan MUSKEGON COUNTY, MI The last of the Great Lakes Fresh Market grocery stores in West Michigan will soon be history, with the announced closure of the supermarket in North Muskegon. The permanent closure of the store at 520 Whitehall Road was announced on Facebook last week. The post indicated the closure would be soon with no exact date provided. The store is the fourth former Plumb s supermarket operated by Great Lakes Foods, a grocery distributor, to close. Two stores rebranded as Great Lakes Fresh Markets on Sherman Boulevard in Norton Shores and on Apple Avenue in Muskegon Township closed in late 2018. A fourth, at 3271 E. Colby St. in Whitehall Township was closed by the new owners during October 2017. Phone messages left at the North Muskegon store were not returned, nor where calls placed with Great Lakes Foods LLC, based in Menominee. North Muskegon City Manager Sam Janson said he was disappointed but not surprised by the store s closure. He said he has not spoken with the owners of the market. Having a full service grocery store is something a lot of communities are missing these days, Janson said. In November 2016, Great Lakes Foods took over as primary distributor for the three Plumbs stores in Muskegon, North Muskegon and Whitehall Township. When Plumb, Inc. ceased operations on Feb. 12, 2017 after more than 80 years as a Muskegon based business, L. M. Foods LLC took ownership of Plumb Inc. assets as the grocer s secured creditor. L. M. Foods LLC and Great Lakes Foods LLC are both located in Menominee and owned by Tom Kuber.

Hudsonville announces 2 special flavors Pair cut catalytic converters out of cars parked on Lehigh Valley streets, cops say Two men from Allentown are accused of cutting catalytic converters from cars parked in two Lehigh Valley boroughs. On Jan. 2, two Catasauqua residents reported their catalytic converters were stolen from their Honda Elements. One car was parked in the 400 block of Front Street and the other was parked in the 400 block of Craine Street, less than 0.4 miles from each other, police said. Police said an officer on patrol at about 2:30 a. m. Jan. 2, saw Jose Rivera hiding behind a Honda Element parked in the 900 block of Main Street in Northampton borough, records say. Police saw a Toyota minivan speeding away from the area and stopped it at Seventh and Washington streets. Jose Rivera, 22, was hiding behind a tree and Edwardo Rivera, 33, was a passenger in the van, police said. There was a ski mask, gloves, two saws with red blades, other tools and two freshly cut catalytic converters in the van, police said. The cut marks on the exhaust pipe from the car in Northampton Borough had red paint chips on it, and the two converters found in the Riveras van also had red paint shavings on them, police said. The two men were released, and the van was towed. Later that day, the owner of a Honda Element in Northampton borough reported to police her catalytic converter was cut but not removed. Police filed charges against the pair on Friday. Police are still searching for Jose Rivera, but Edwardo Rivera was charged Sunday with two counts of theft, as well as receiving stolen property, criminal mischief, loitering and possession of an instrument of a crime. Edwardo Rivera was sent to Northampton County Prison in lieu of 25,000 bail. At the time of his arraignment, he was free on 10,000 unsecured bail in a Whitehall Township retail theft case, records show. Jose Rivera was paroled in September after pleading guilty to fleeing from Bethlehem police in a Feb. 5 incident in the city, records show. He was sentenced to six months to 23 months in Lehigh County Jail, followed by one year of probation. Catalytic converter thefts have been a problem for years. The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) reported that between 2008 and 2015, there were 25,394 catalytic converter thefts reported across the country. The devices contain each of three precious metals: rhodium, platinum or palladium. The devices can bring between 20 and 240 in scrap metal, the NICB said. SUVs are targeted for their ground clearance, because thieves don t need a jack to reach the devices. Police reported this week that catalytic converters were stolen from six ambulances parked in a Delaware County, Pennsylvania lot, Fox channel 29 reported. In the past two weeks, thieves stole catalytic converters from disability buses in Akron, Ohio, News 5 in Cleveland reported. Portland, Oregon police reported 130 catalytic converters were reported stolen between June 1 and Dec. 31 of last year. Sarah Cassi may be reached at scassi lehighvalleylive. com.

Feds arrest 4th suspect in Poconos weed deal turned double homicide A fourth person accused of being part of a marijuana deal and robbery that ended with two people killed in Monroe County was arrested Wednesday, authorities said. Harrith Saleem Brown, 23, with past addresses in Fredericksburg, Virginia, was caught by U. S. Marshals as he tried to flee from a home in the 400 block of East 136th Street in the Bronx, according to a news release. Brown was turned over to the New York Police Department Central Booking Unit to await extradition to Pennsylvania. A third suspect Zaire Flex Burkett, 20, of Whitehall Township was arrested Jan. 15. and is charged in the killings of 22 year old Dylan Beinert and 23 year old Khalil Durante. Durante s father, Walter Durante, was critically wounded in the gunfire. Police allege Brown, Burkett, Deani Powell, of Easton, and her boyfriend Matthew Burke, of Stroud Township, arranged to rob Beinert on Dec. 4, 2019, after seeing Snapchat videos he posted with large amounts of marijuana and money, court papers say. The night of the robbery, Burke picked up Burkett and Pop in Allentown, and then drove to a home in the 1700 block of Silver Maple Road in Chestnuthill Township, police said. Powell, who was posing as a buyer, met the men there, investigators said. Powell met with Beinert, but police said she was texting the men at the same time. When Powell left under the guise of getting her money from her purse, Burke, Burkett and the other man entered the home. Beinert began struggling with Burkett and Pop a witness reported Beinert grabbed for a shotgun, state police said. Beinert was fatally shot and Khalil Durante was shot and seriously wounded, state police said. Durante was shot again outside the home and later died from his injuries, state police said. After his son was shot the second time, Walter Durante screamed and reached for the gun, and he was also shot, state police said. The armed group fled from the Monroe County home. Powell was arrested first on Dec. 5, and reportedly confessed to helping organize the robbery. Burke was arrested Dec. 8, and also reportedly confessed to shooting the two men. Burkett is awaiting his preliminary hearing on homicide and related charges. Powell and Burke s charges were sent to Monroe County Court following hearings on Dec. 20, records show. All three are being held without bail. Sarah Cassi may be reached at scassi lehighvalleylive. com. Follow her on Twitter SarahCassi. Find lehighvalleylive. com on Facebook.  Ten employees lose jobs at Lehigh County 911 center due to ‘violations of policy’ Ten employees at the Lehigh County emergency radio dispatch center lost their jobs this week due to violations of longstanding county policy, according to the county s director of general services. Three supervisors were fired on Tuesday and seven operators resigned Wednesday, according to Director of General Services Rick Molchany. The significance of the violations was such that we needed to take action as quickly as possible, he said. WFMZ Channel 69 reports that the employees lost their jobs because they participated in a midnight toast at the 911 center on New Year s Eve with egg nog spiked with rum. Molchany declined to offer specific reasons for the terminations and resignations. He said they re personnel matters. The employees have the opportunity to appeal the terminations, he said. The policy violations come at a time when the 911 center is already grappling with staff turnover due to a merger between the Allentown and Lehigh County 911 centers. Molchany said his center is budgeted for 53 operators and 10 supervisors. He s addressing the staffing shortfall by mandating overtime, offering rewards to employees and ramping up training for new recruits. Several employees are nearing pre employee testing and the county plans to hire an outside agency to get prospective employees certified more quickly than usual, he said. Back in 2015, Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a law that sunset funding for the state s only two standalone 911 communication centers in Allentown and Bethlehem as a push to regionalization. After a study and talk of a Lehigh Valley wide center, it was decided that Bethlehem would merge with Northampton County, including the Lehigh County section of the city, while Allentown would consolidated with Lehigh County s 911 center. The mergers became official in June. Molchany said several of the Allentown 911 center employees elected to find jobs elsewhere rather than be retrained on a new system in Lehigh County. It took time to replenish the ranks, which are again depleted after the policy violations. He admits he s concerned with staff morale but said he s doing the best he can to get staff levels back up and execute the merger successfully. The county is in the process of integrating its police response protocols between Allentown police and officers in other municipalities. A call for a barking dog, for instance, doesn t merit an immediate police check in Allentown but it does in South Whitehall Township. Molchany said the county is working to make response protocols seamless across the entire county. Eventually Lehigh County wants to standardize protocols between itself and Northampton County so that employees from one county can sub in at the other in the event of a mass hazard or unexpected staff shortfall similar to the one that befell Lehigh County this week. It s a very complicated process, Molchany said. Rudy Miller may be reached at rmiller lehighvalleylive. com. Follow him on Twitter RudyMillerLV.

Transportation Security Administration gate at airports, along with federal facilities and military bases, will be off limits starting Oct. 1, 2020, to anyone without a Real ID compliant identification. On Friday at Lehigh Valley International Airport, local, state and federal transportation officials gathered about 20 yards from the TSA checkpoint to stress the deadline is fast approaching and there will be no exceptions. ""Don't wait. We have about 251 days from today until Real ID goes into effect,"" said Thomas R. Stoudt, executive director of the Lehigh Northampton Airport Authority that owns and operates the airport in Hanover Township, Lehigh County. Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, if you approach this TSA checkpoint behind me without a Real ID compliant document a driver s license, passport or passport card you will miss your flight, Stoudt said during a news conference. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation outlines documents and proof of identification needed to obtain a Real ID compliant driver s license or identification card at dmv. pa. gov/REALID. The airport authority also lists the steps domestic and international travelers need to take, at realid. flyabe. com, including the documents needed: proof of identity such as valid passport or birth certificate Social Security card two proofs of current address and proof of any legal name changes. In New Jersey, residents can visit state. nj. us/mvc/realid to learn more about what s required of them, including two proofs of residential address, one proof of Social Security Number and six points of identification. Michael Kichline, of the U. S. Transportation Security Administration, holds up a passport Friday, Jan. 24, 2020, at Lehigh Valley International Airport to demonstrate one of 15 alternatives to a state issued driver's license or identification card that comply with federal Real ID requirements. Real ID compliant documentation will be necessary to fly both domestically and internationally starting Oct. 1, 2020, as well as to enter federal facilities or military bases. Kurt Bresswein For lehighvalleylive. com In addition to a driver s license or state ID, there are 15 forms of identification that comply with federal Real ID rules, including passports and the less expensive passport cards. For Lehigh Valley residents looking to get a Real ID compliant driver s license or ID the same day, the PennDOT Driver License Center at 1101 MacArthur Road in Whitehall Township can issue one over the counter. It will take about two weeks to receive one in the mail from other license centers. The only difference between a regular license or ID and one that complies with Real ID is a gold star, demonstrating the holder has satisfied the federal requirements proving they are who they say they are. ""From our perspective at TSA, Real ID gives us an important tool in our security toolbox and improves the reliability and accuracy of state issued identification documents,"" said Michael Kichline, assistant federal security director eastern Pennsylvania. ""And more importantly it prevents and deters terrorists' ability to evade detection by using fraudulent identification. "" A gold star embedded in a state issued driver's license or identification card shows it complies with federal Real ID requirements to fly both domestically and internationally, as well as to enter federal facilities or military bases, starting Oct. 1, 2020. Kurt Bresswein For lehighvalleylive. com The Real ID came out of a federal law passed in 2005 to comply with the 9/11 Commission s recommendation to set minimum security standards for state issued driver s license and identification cards. Pennsylvania lawmakers fought the requirement, first passing a law in 2012 to say the state would not comply. That was repealed 2017 with a law saying the state would participate in the new regulation but specifying Real ID would be optional and that any cost couldn t be born by taxpayers, said Kurt J. Myers, PennDOT deputy secretary for driver and vehicle services. As a result, Pennsylvanians opting to get a Real ID compliant license or ID card must pay a one time fee of 30, on top of the 30.50 renewal fee. That license or ID is then good for four years on top of however long the regular license would have been valid. New Jersey charges 24. Pennsylvania began issuing Real ID compliant identification March 1, 2019, and has completed about 700,000 applications so far, Myers said. That leaves about 2.2 million residents who have not taken action to get their Real ID compliant documents or who have an alternatively acceptable identification. Failure to comply could be ""embarrassing and costly"" for anyone who gets turned away at an airport security check for a trip they've long had planned, Myers said. We would encourage people to get this done sooner rather than later, he said Friday outside Allentown. Historically speaking, July and August are very busy months for the Department of Transportation in relation to driver s license issuance. And we fully expect that we will be even busier as we get closer to that Oct. 1 date. Information is available Friday, Jan. 24, 2020, at Lehigh Valley International Airport on Real ID compliant identification necessary to fly both domestically and internationally starting Oct. 1, 2020.

Yerwood Center,"“A Little Bit of Mercy...” — A Darien family's loss to addiction. William Pickering Jones III wanted to become a lawyer to help people. Law is a means for me to add a little bit of my own mercy, to make the world a little less cold and more just, My hope in pursuing a law degree, is to give back to help those without a voice, the marginalized, the disenfranchised, the neuro disabled, the poor, and all those who have struggled to be heard. Pope Francis said it well, In the fall of 2018, William, who was attending Fordham Law School, encountered a stranger suffering an overdose in the park adjacent to the school. Knowing what to do, he tried to take action by asking the school s security staff for Narcan, the common name for Naxalone, a medication used in overdose emergencies. The security guards didn t have it. However, William was able to call the police and give them the critical information needed to save the person s life. The experience led him to initiate efforts for Narcan training for Fordham Law students and staff. The story, in a letter received from one of William s classmates, sat within a seemingly endless pile of letters, cards, and remembrances on his parents kitchen table on a cold morning in February. The same kitchen table at which William s mother, Elizabeth Higgins Jones Betsy shared her last conversation with her only son on Dec. 25. Though he fought hard to beat it, William lost his battle with addiction on Christmas Day. He was 27. Despite his driving need and efforts to help others including saving someone s life the one person he couldn t save was himself. He fought valiantly every day, Betsy said. While at Fordham, William, along with the same classmate who wrote the letter, Lura Chamberlain, founded the Drug Policy Reform Group. Its stated purpose is to foster intellectual discussion, build community relationships, and support meaningful policy reform around legal and sociopolitical issues relating to the supply and demand of illegal, addictive, and/or consciousness altering substances: treatment options for substance users and harm reduction efforts on an individual, community, and national scale. I don t know many people who would rush to a stranger s aid without hesitation, and even fewer who can say they ve saved a life, Chamberlain wrote in her letter, but William was one of them. She added that the Narcan training that William started will continue to be pursued by the Drug Policy Reform Group in William s memory, both because of its crucial relationship to the group s objectives and because it represents the kind of simple, non discriminating compassion for others that William embodied so well. The Jones family is a private one. That is what makes talking to me about William difficult for Betsy. But his passionate need to help to change the world is what is encouraging her. That privacy meant that almost all of Betsy s and her husband Bill s friends and family were not aware of William s struggle with addiction. As a consequence, many were shocked when William died in December. The reason that the Jones family kept William s struggle private was because of the very stigma they are now speaking out against. They kept it quiet to protect William, so that any negative connotations would not follow him as he moved forward with his life so that he would not be defined by it, his mother said. However, Betsy said her family wanted to make it clear that William had died from a drug overdose by adding to his obituary that memorial donations were to be made to Shatterproof because as Betsy says, addiction is a disease, like any other it does not discriminate. Shatterproof is a national non profit organization based in Connecticut that is dedicated to helping families deal with their addicted loved ones. CEO Gary Mendell lost his son Brian to addiction. Betsy pointed out the ease and frequency with which physicians have prescribed opioids. She and her husband, believe that some of us are simply biologically predisposed to becoming quickly addicted to opioids. She said that when she was prescribed opioids, they made her sick to her stomach. When William was prescribed them, it was the beginning of his struggle. Background William and his three younger sisters, Julia, Catherine and Elizabeth, grew up in a lovely home in the Tokeneke section of Darien. William was aware of what he had, in terms of family, education, and economic stability, and also aware of what others didn t and wanted to help. In his personal statement, he describes recovering from a major concussion, he said, while playing lacrosse for McGill University. William took a medical leave from McGill after the concussion caused him to struggle academically and socially. Upon his return, he joined a McGill research project that studied worldwide population regarding how social determinants, such as race, income, and health care, impact children born with neuro disabilities specifically, how those factors impact the path of the child s life. I was not a bad person before all this. I grew up privileged, white, well educated, with supportive friends and a loving family. A nice, relatively normal childhood. But I was blind. I was sheltered. Things came easily to me. It was not until I had something major taken away that I truly knew how lucky I d been. I could now empathize, not just sympathize, he wrote. This caused William to reflect on his blessings and give him passionate purpose. He began volunteering for the Yerwood Center in Stamford, which provides after school tutoring to local elementary school students, many of whom are poor and minorities. And it was then that he decided he wanted to be a lawyer. A public health crisis According to Shatterproof, in 2017, 70,237 Americans died from drug overdoses. On average, drug overdoses now kill 192 Americans per day. Darien resident Holly Jespersen, who serves as Shatterproof s senior communications manager, says one of the organization s main goals is to remove the stigma and shame of addiction. Part of the reason for the rise in addiction and overdoses, Jespersen says, is because those who suffer from dependence on opioids, when unable to access prescribed meds, are buying them on the street. Often, these street opioids are laced with fentanyl, which Jespersen says is a deadly combination literally. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) affirms that this is the worst drug overdose epidemic in U. S. history. And the problem has grown so severe that, in 2014, the CDC added prescription drug overdose prevention to its list of the top five public health challenges. Three Illnesses and deaths related to substance use disorders are at epidemic levels right now, and it s quickly getting worse. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that in 2017, there were 955 overdose deaths involving opioids in Connecticut a rate of 27.7 deaths per 100,000 people, which is twofold higher than the national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100,000 people. The greatest increase in opioid deaths was see in cases involving synthetic opioids (mainly fentanyl): a rise from 79 deaths in 2016 to 686 in 2017. Deaths involving heroin also increased from 98 deaths in 2012 to 450 in 2016 but saw a decrease in 2017 to 425 deaths. Prescription opioids were involved in 273 deaths in 2017, a more than fourfold increase from 60 in 2012. In October 2017, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Darien First Selectman Jayme Stevenson has made fighting opioid addiction one of her priorities. While running for Lieutenant Governor last spring and summer, she offered that if elected she would make it a priority to have that office take leadership of the crisis. The Stamford Advocate recently reported a growing list of defendants in the torrent of litigation against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma extends beyond the firm s owners. While the eight members of the Sackler family figure most prominently among the accused, Connecticut s expanded lawsuit filed recently and a similar complaint from Massachusetts highlight the crucial role of four current and former executives in carrying out the alleged fraudulent marketing of the firm s opioids. Purdue has denied Connecticut s and Massachusetts allegations, as well as those in the lawsuits filed by more than 1,000 other states and cities. Supervised injection facilities Last fall, William wrote a legal paper about the legal obstacles to creating supervised injection facilities in the United States. They are a place where intravenous users of opioids can inject in the presence of medical professionals who can administer lifesaving treatment if needed. SIFs represent a promising public health intervention with the potential to make a real impact on the opioid epidemic, William Jones, paper on legal obstacles for supervised injection facilities in the United States for Health Law Biomedical Ethics. Though acknowledging that some communities are concerned about increases in drug related crime or substance misuse if these are put in place, William wrote that international evidence shows the opposite its true. As far as the tested United States legality of SIFs, William wrote that first, one courageous city or state will need to open the first SIF. Until then, the ultimate legality remains unclear. At the back of his paper, William dedicated it to all our loved ones lost to this terrible epidemic, and quoted Robert Frost s poem Nothing Gold Can Stay, which concludes, Then leaf subsides to leaf so Eden sank to grief so dawn goes down to day Nothing gold can stay. Reflecting Betsy Jones says the Jones family all has strong opinions and debates could be lively. In these moments, William explained his passionate viewpoint to help others. He taught us something, he made us better, she said. Matthew Diller, dean of Fordham Law School, who spoke at the memorial service at Fordham Law School, attended by nearly 500 called William a natural leader and said that in one of his first conversations with William, he spoke of his motivation to get into law. The memorial service was held before a panel discussion on supervised injection sites that was planned by William and the Drug Policy Reform Group. He spoke about his hopes to help others, and said he believed that by helping one person at a time, he could make the world a better place, Diller said. Betsy also spoke at the Fordham Law School service. Many of you knew William growing up and many of you knew him here as a Fordham Law student you knew him here as Will. What many of you did not know, and sadly all know now, is that William struggled with and lost his battle to addiction. What many of you still do not know is how hard William fought. William told me that he fought every day against his addiction, his enemy, she said. What is extraordinary to us his family, was to learn that William, while working hard at law school, working hard to help those less fortunate through the initiatives he was passionate about, at the same time he was doing all of that, he was fighting his own battle, Betsy said. Vera T. Bullock, the assistant dean of Fordham Law School, gave a eulogy at William s Darien funeral in December, attended by nearly 800. In it, Bullock, with whom William had a close relationship, said she had shared with him that she had lost her son to a drug overdose. She told William that what she missed most were her son s hugs. After that, without fail, William made a point of stopping by my office several times a week. He would come in and simply say time for a hug, Bullock said. That simple gesture sums up to me William s philosophy of life. He always left a conversation, a situation and now the world a better place, she said. Bullock also said when times were stressful they would talk about the things they were grateful for and gave an example. William said that he was grateful for a strong turnout for the Rally for Lifesaving Treatment in Prisons Jails that he organized or that the model of a Riker s solitary confinement cell that he had helped to build on the 3rd floor had interested people in the conditions of the incarcerated. Boy did he help me put my life in perspective, she said. If there was anyone who could understand William s journey, it was his close friend growing up in Darien, who bravely fought cancer for over ten years. This courageous young man was an inspiration to William and to everyone who knew him. A quote from a letter to his friend from William after they hadn t seen each for quite some time was on the back of the program at William s funeral. Our paths may have diverged, but I feel as though we were also running parallel. We were never as far apart as our perceptions may have suggested. And now that these paths have converged, I doubt they will ever diverge again. If they do, the gap is in our minds. Sadly, his dear friend passed away in March, two months after William. Betsy, Bill, Julia, Catherine and Elizabeth are devastated. Betsy and her family find comfort believing that they did everything they could for William but she also said: The tragedy in all of this is that William was such a good person who was trying to do good. He owned his mistakes. Sometimes, a mother s love isn t enough William received all the love, all the support and all the best medical and psychological care that we as a family could possibly give and William was so grateful for it, his family said. He told us over and over how grateful he was of us standing by him. William wanted to beat it his addiction but sadly his addiction beat him, they said. He didn t want this, Betsy added. As Betsy recalled her last conversation with William at that same kitchen table gesturing to where he sat that night she said that she was grateful that they had the chance to share that moment. Nothing was left unsaid, she said. In her speech at Fordham Law, Betsy spoke of that last conversation adding that he made me a better person. William made all of us better because he made us all aware. We are so proud of William so proud of his humanity. On Christmas Eve, just before William died, I had the chance to say what I wanted to say, what I needed to say, she said. I am so proud of you, William. Look how far you have come. I love you so much, she told him. I love you too, Mom I m so proud of you, he responded. Fordham Law School s Public Interest Resource Center named William P. Jones, III Public Interest 2L Student of the Year in recognition of his volunteer work, his leadership, and inspiration to others to become involved in public service. Moving mountains ""Barn's burnt down now I can see the moon. "" haiku by Mizuta Masahide, a favorite haiku of William s. Betsy Jones and her family hope by sharing William s story, it will carry on his passionate commitment to help others and continuing his fervent hope to make a change. As Betsy said in an email to The Darien Times, The time for drug policy reform and early intervention is now. All of us must become educated in order to dispel the shame and disgrace that surrounds our addicted loved ones and their families. William s law school statement underlines this sentiment in his realistic optimism for the future, if we all pitch in. It was his belief that even the most unsurmountable such as conquering the pain, the epic loss, and the stigma of opioid addiction could be done as a united effort of humanity. Instead of moving a mountain, I am trying to move a pebble I care about if we all move our pebbles, we can move mountains, William Jones, in his law school admissions personal statement. The Jones family hopes that by telling William s story, they can help at least one person avoid what happened to their wonderful son and bring awareness about this terrible epidemic. They thank the Darien Police Department and Darien Post 53 for their quick response on Christmas morning and for their gentle respect and kindness. The Jones family would also like to thank their friends, family and the Darien community for their love and support.

Magic Kingdom,"Disney World New Year’s Eve fireworks: Watch live here Mickey Mouse and his friends are ready to ring in 2020 and, thanks to the magic of the internet, you can join them. Walt Disney World in Orlando is celebrating New Year s Eve with a magical pyrotechnics show, Fantasy in the Sky Fireworks. The extravaganza will start at 11:45 p. m. ET (10:45 p. m. CT) on Dec. 31, lighting up the night sky over the iconic Cinderella s Castle in the Magic Kingdom. It won t just be fireworks on display. Disney said in its blog the live stream will start a few minutes before midnight to share some of the highlights of what to expect in Disney parks in 2020. You can watch livestream below or check out the Disney blog. Given the crowds at Disney, watching the fireworks online may be the easiest way. Earlier on New Year s Eve, Disney watchers reported the Magic Kingdom was having to turn away some guests due to overcrowding. Disney s Hollywood Studios, EPCOT and Disney s Animal Kingdom are still welcoming guests. Guests who are in the Magic Kingdom are reporting waits of up to three hours for popular rides such as Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train.  Walt Disney World: Woman Reportedly Jumps From Ferryboat Folks on the ferryboat heading to and from Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom witnessed a rescue earlier this week, as a woman jumped from the second story of the boat into Seven Seas Lagoon. The woman, whose identity has not been released publicly, was travelling with people she knew when she jumped from the boat into the water. It's not known whether or not she was heading to Magic Kingdom or away from the park. According to a report from the Orange County Sheriff's Office (per the Orlando Sentinel), the woman jumped from the boat in an apparent suicide attempt. While her name is still unknown to the public, the sheriff's office has revealed that she is 56 years old. Cpl. Antwan Daniels said that the woman jumped from the second story of the ferryboat into Seven Seas Lagoon at about 7pm local time. A rescue unit was called in and found the woman in the water, promptly taking her to a local hospital. She's being treated for any injuries and is receiving a mental evaluation. Officials from Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District first responded to the incident on the ferryboat Monday night. If you've never made the trek to Disney World, or haven't heard of the extra travel necessary to get to Magic Kingdom, the ferryboat is one of multiple ways for guests to get to the flagship Disney World park. If you drive your car to Magic Kingdom, you'll actually park at the transportation and ticket center, where you'll then be prompted to get on the ferryboat or monorail in order to get to Magic Kingdom. If you're staying on Disney property or coming from one of the other three parks (Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom), you can take a bus straight to Magic Kingdom and skip the transportation center altogether.  Disney World's Magic Kingdom turns away guests on New Year's Eve Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom Park began turning away guests on New Year's Eve, the park tweeted Tuesday afternoon. ""We're experiencing a busy day at the Walt Disney World Resort,"" said the tweet, posted at 2:17 p. m. EST. ""Magic Kingdom Park is not admitting new Guests at this time. "" The tweet steered visitors toward the Animal Kingdom Theme Park, Epcot and Hollywood Studios, which currently has several ""Star Wars"" themed experiences. Not everyone will be turned away at the gate: Disney told USA TODAY that resort guests and those with annual passes will still be admitted to Magic Kingdom. Those with complimentary tickets, military tickets and guests re entering the park will be admitted as well. New Year's Eve festivities in the Magic Kingdom include a fireworks display and dance parties. Epcot also has a fireworks show planned, along with celebrations at each country's pavilion when the clock strikes midnight in the respective nation. Hollywood Studios will have fireworks, too, while the Animal Kingdom will have a dance party and a countdown on the Tree of Life. Disney parks' 2020 price increase is just around the corner: Here's what to expect Meeting of the Marys: Mini Poppinses run into their idol at Disney World ORLANDO, Fla. Sisters Demi and Tory had a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious time meeting their idol, Mary Poppins, while dressed as her on a family trip to Disney World on December 23. Mary Poppins and Bert met the mini Poppinses in front of a castle in Disney's Magic Kingdom in the Orlando, Florida, theme park and took the girls on a jaunt around the grounds. The girls' mother, Caroline Ross, said this special moment took place on the last day of the family's week long trip. On Facebook, Ross responded to users who seemed to think she had the ""mad seamstress skills"" to create the little costumes. ""Yeah, ShopDisney is the one with those mad skills, I just have awesome credit card purchasing power!"" Ross wrote.  Disney World Was So Crowded, Magic Kingdom Had To Turn Away Guests On New Year's Eve It s the most magical place on earth, but if you try to go to Disney World on a holiday, sometimes the most magical place on earth can become a bit hellish. That seems to have happened at the tail end of the year, as Disney World s Magic Kingdom had to turn people away at the gate on New Year s Eve. Why Did Disney World s Magic Kingdom Turn People Away? In fact, the popular theme park did attempt to warn people who were heading in for the day, noting on twitter via the Walt Disney Guest Service s account that the other parks were open but Magic Kingdom was not letting any more enterprising individuals in for at least a time. We re experiencing a busy day at the Walt Disney World Resort. We invite you to visit Animal Kingdom Theme Park, Epcot and Hollywood Studios, while Magic Kingdom Park is not admitting new Guests at this time. The message also included a number to call if people were hoping for availability later in the day. The closure was a Phase B closure for the parks, meaning people with certain passes or magic bands were still let in, but others with single day passes were turned away. Given the tweet went out at 1:17 yesterday, that may seem like a pretty early time for the park to hit capacity. However, it s worth noting the early afternoons at Disney World s Magic Kingdom and its other parks are often the most crowded. Theoretically, this is because the morning people who go for the first part of the day are still there in the early afternoon, and the people coming in for the latter part of the day have filtered in at that point too. While some people will stay in a given park for the entire day and probably did in higher numbers if they found out they wouldn t be re admitted a lot of people go for just a portion of the day often including some part of the afternoon. What Magic Kingdom And Other Parks Had Planned For New Year s Eve Magic Kingdom had some special festivities planned for New Year s Eve, including a fireworks program and dance parties. In addition, the parks are always open very late on the holiday to give you more bang for your buck. Still wait times can be longer and tweets from yesterday showed how some rides had a two hour or even three hour wait! See more The other parks also had special events planned. This includes fireworks at Hollywood Studios and Epcot. Like Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom also had a dance party planned. Finally, at Epcot there was an additionally cool program in the countries at the back of the park, which featured a celebration in each country as the clock struck midnight in those countries respective time zones! Related: 8 New Attractions Coming To Walt Disney World So, if you missed out on Magic Kingdom s celebration, hopefully guests hopped over to one of the other parks and were able to get in with no fuss. Generally, while park hopping is strongly encouraged most of the time at Walt Disney World and park hopper passes are very popular, sometimes park hopping can be a detriment on overly crowded days. This includes holidays, but also days when big attractions open, like what recently happened when Walt Disney World opened Star Wars: Galaxy s Edge. If you exit, you run the risk of not being let back in. In particular, the holiday season is a big deal at both Walt Disney World and its California arm Disneyland, as the parks are decked out in displays of festive cheer. It s easy to see why people would want to go around the holidays, but it does often mean more planning and longer lines.

""He would not have urinated if he thought he could have held it or made it to the bathroom without causing further issues,"" the incident report said.

Her husband apparently hit the other man in the chest with his cane, strong enough to leave a red mark, according to the report. That was enough for her husband to be banned from Disney World. The Canadian couple decided not to press criminal charges. In another case, a woman told authorities she had been pushed ""mildly"" by a stranger when they got in an argument at the Magic Kingdom. What had triggered the disagreement? An oversized turkey leg, a staple theme park dish. The woman munched on the turkey leg and dropped pieces of meat on the ground as she made her way across the park.

After gentle reassurance from Ellianna Blair, her owner (right), the dog grows in confidence, her tail begins to wag and she crawls up to the mascot and sniffs the costume They then play together as the dog jumps around on the ground and Stitch pats the floor in front of her. The camerawoman says: 'If you had a ball, boy, she'd be in there with you. ' In one cute moment, Ezra puts her paws on the mascot's hands and lets him stroke her head. Owner Ms Blair, who posted the footage online in December, and who has a form of hyperactive nervous system on top of a spine injury, said: 'I'm so proud of her though, she kept all four paws on the ground the whole time and regained her focus right after. ' She also revealed that her uncle played Pleakley in the 2002 animated movie.

Beaches, thrill rides and ... patriotism found in sunny Florida There were thrills and some chills, when wet clothes met air conditioning, but one of the takeaways from our recent family vacation to Florida was patriotism. For the first time since 2013, all four family members went to the same distant place at the same time. That doesn't seem all that hard to do but it has been for our busy family. Six years earlier it was to Disneyland for a wedding. This time it was Disney World, no wedding though we saw Disney themed T shirts imprinted with ""Mr. "" or ""Mrs. "" It included day trips to Daytona Beach and to the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. Maybe deep down inside we had the need, the need for speed. Our money certainly was departing from us at the speed of sound. Ulysses, Ronnie and the boys We went to Animal Kingdom and Magic Kingdom, which is a recreation of Disneyland. I never realized we had tens of thousands of close friends, but they joined us each day. Daily attendance there averages almost 58,000. It was above average five days after Christmas. One of our favorite stops, in part because there was no line, was the Hall of Presidents. No, we did not skip the great rides to nerd out. We did not make it this exhibit at Disneyland, and we had time before joining Capt. Jack Sparrow and the other Pirates of the Caribbean. As we enter into a presidential election year, our views of the nation's highest office may not be the best. Yet, as you can see by the full Republican field in 2016 and Democratic field for 2020, everyone wants to be the president. There are perks. This 20 or so minute presentation was uplifting. Forty five men have led our country, some for 13 years (FDR) and one for 31 days (William Henry Harrison, who died of pneumonia). There is a stirring video presentation and then the presidents are presented as a group. Special attention is given George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, as would be expected. Standing, front and center is Donald Trump, postured like Donald Trump. He owns the stage. No surprise there. We wondered how he would be presented, thinking Disney folks may not be his biggest fans. But after each president was spotlighted, animatronically nodding to the audience, it was Trump time. He recited the 35 words that comprise the oath of office, and then spoke about being the president. His hand gestures, of which there are many, were right on. His tie dangled. I looked to see if Barack Obama was rolling his eyes or pounding his head against the wall but he politely listened. There was applause when the presentation concluded. I would think this audience skews to the patriotic. Amid all the fantasy, this bit of realism was refreshing. Heroes of space Before our two days at Disney World, we blasted off to Cape Canaveral. Well, as fast as we could on Florida's clogged highways and interrupted by pay booths on toll roads. We only had the exact amount of quarters twice. I think we paid close to 10 in tolls on two trips across the land of hanging chads. You want inspiring? Go see a national landmark, be it natural, such as Mount Rushmore, or the Kennedy Space Center. You just want to beat your chest in pride. I had no idea that our bus tour would take us so close to the action inside the working area. We drove right by the Vehicle Assembly Building, one of the largest buildings in the world by area. It's where they build rockets and assembled the fuel tanks and rocket boosters for the shuttle. We drove by Launch Pads 39A and 39B. We saw the crawler, which carries the launch pads carrying the rockets. We were hit with a meteror shower of facts on the drive, such as the crawler's top speed is 1 mph and that water is used to buffer the sound waves during launch to protect the craft. We drove by ""the most important building"" on the site, according to our driver: the cafeteria. ""No lunch,"" he said, ""no launch. "" All the names my generation and the next grew up with came to life. I once met Alan Shepherd, and I was in total awe. Talk about owning the room. Even President Trump can't say he has been on the moon. His spacesuit is on display, and it has moon dust on it still. What impressed us was how rudimentary this all looks to us decades later. It was mentioned that our cellphones, which we used for photos and videos, are better computers than what they had in the 1960s and 1970s. And we got men into space, to the moon, to the moon's surface and back. Wow. One astronaut, in a video, said if someone like him could do it, anyone could do it. Well, probably not. But what a challenge to the many kids who were there, kids who left for home wearing NASA, ""Mars or bust"" and ""Failure Is Not An Option"" T shirts. The space shuttle Atlantis is displayed, and you can even walk under it. A Saturn V rocket, 60 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty, is displayed, in the parts it separates into during its flight. The humans crammed in a space capsule at the top. You can walk under that, too. Emphasis was given the international space effort, and how the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union gave way in peace time and cooperative efforts for mankind. We touched a small moon rock. I know there are some who believe all this fake, and that rock probably came from the nearby beach. As our Texas bound airliner took off from Orlando, we could see the VAB. And I wondered, did the astronauts ever tell Mission Control: ""Houston, we've had a problem. Jack can't retract his tray table, and my seat is not in the upright position. "" Certainly, they didn't have cellphones to put in . ""rocket mode?""

It's no surprise that the Disney Parks draw millions of guests every year as people from around the globe flock to the popular theme parks to see the iconic characters, experience the rides and attractions, and eat tasty theme park treats. In 2018, an estimated 20.9 million guests visited the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and over 18 million paid a visit to its sister park, Disneyland, in Anaheim, California, making these two of the most visited theme parks in the world. Of course, a visit to see Mickey Mouse can be pretty pricey a one day, one park ticket to Disney World will set you back around 109 per person (plus tax), while a ticket to one of Disneyland s parks starts at 104, depending on the date. The entry fee alone can be enough to scare people off, especially if you re thinking about taking the entire family to the parks. However, with a little extra planning, you can save hundreds on your Disney vacation. Here are 9 ways to save money at the Disney Parks before, during, and after your vacation. Disney World Credit: Getty Images Before Your Disney Vacation: Buy a Disney vacation package One of the easiest ways to save on a Disney vacation is to book one of the company's vacation packages. With the vacation packages at Disney World, guests can choose from more than 25 Disney Resort Hotels and customize their tickets to access all four theme parks (along with the two water parks). A sample package that combines accommodations and park tickets for a family of four staying for six nights and seven days goes for around 106 per person, per day (for a total of 2,967), marking huge savings compared to buying tickets and booking a hotel separately. Similar vacation package options can be found for Disneyland, too. Find accommodations just outside the park Though it's tempting to stay within the park s borders, it may be prudent to look for accommodations just outside its walls. The hotels outside of Disney World and Disneyland tend to be much cheaper than those with the Disney branding. And, larger families might be more comfortable in a bigger home booked via Airbnb. Plus, booking a home means you'll probably be able to access a kitchen, so you could save even more by cooking a few meals yourself. Visit Disney during the off season In 2018, Disney World unveiled new dynamic pricing. This means that tickets are more expensive during popular times to visit (like school breaks and holidays), but it also means that people can find cheaper tickets on off peak days, which most often occur during the off peak seasons. If you can plan a trip to Disney World or Disneyland during a slower season, you ll not only be rewarded with cheaper tickets, but you ll also find fewer tourists and shorter lines for your favorite rides, making it a real win win. Use points to book your Disney vacation According to The Points Guy, there are a few cards that allow users to purchase Disney tickets or book Disney hotels on points. Those cards include the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, the Citi Premier Card, as well as the Disney Visa. During Your Disney Vacation: Take the Magical Express Bus from the airport If you did book one of those aforementioned Disney vacations or are staying at one of Walt Disney World s hotels, you can score a free ride to and from the Orlando International Airport on the Magical Express Bus. As an added bonus, they ll even deliver your bags straight to your room. Pack a lunch If you re trying to save a few bucks during your Disney vacation, you may want to pack lunch. A quick bite can run upwards of 50 for a family of four inside Disneyland or Disney World, and that s not even counting the snacks. On the bright side, bringing your own lunch means you can bypass the lines at restaurants and get to your favorite rides a little faster. Skip the Park Hopper Pass If you re visiting either park for multiple days, you may be tempted to upgrade your ticket with a Park Hopper Pass, which adds about 60 per person, per day, depending on your ticket package. This pass allows you to visit multiple parks in the same day. However, as anyone who s ever visited a Disney park will tell you, you really do need an entire day (or more) to really experience each park. So, forgo the upgrade and just pick a different park for each day of your vacation instead. After Your Disney Vacation: Print your own photos Throughout your time at the Disney Parks, you'll undoubtedly come across several photographers offering to take your picture. However, you ll need to sign up for Disney Photo Pass and pay to download those photos, and that cost can really add up. Whether you own a DSLR camera or just snap photos on your phone, you can easily document your entire Disney experience on your own to save a few bucks. Then, use a website like Shutterfly to print those same 4x6 photos for just 18 cents a pop. Buy souvenirs outside the parks 5 Things to Know About Disney's Riviera Resort Before You Take Your Kids When you set out to plan a family vacation to Walt Disney World, the choices can be overwhelming, with where to stay topping that list. Every Disney World resort is family friendly, but with three tiers of accommodations and amenities (value, moderate, deluxe), plus theming that runs the gamut from no frills with in your face characters at Art of Animation to refined (albeit wallet busting) Victorian elegance at the Grand Floridian, it makes sense to do some serious research before choosing the resort that best suits your taste and budget. To add to your choices, last December Disney World opened a new resort, Disney's Riviera Resort, which takes its place among the nicest but also most expensive resorts on the property. Here, we break it down to help you decide if a stay at Riviera is right for your family. What's Disney's Riviera Resort Like and Who Should Stay Here? Inspired by the grand turn of the century European holiday resorts lining the French and Italian Riviera, Disney's Riviera Resort has a decidedly swanky vibe. Despite its nods to the past, this ""Deluxe"" tier hotel feels more like a modern European retreat. Disney theming is subtle but abundant across the property, with nods to Walt Disney's European travels showcased throughout the resort's artwork, d cor, and even in family photos, books and souvenirs displayed in the Voyageurs' Lounge just off the hotel lobby. For Parents: If sipping coffee at a French caf or twirling pasta at a cliffside restaurant in Italy is more your style than downing a theme park hot dog while sweating in line for character meet and greets, this is the place for you. For Kids: There's a lot to entertain the youngest guests here, from a highly rated character breakfast at rooftop restaurant Topolino's Terrace (more on that later) to a zero depth feature pool and fun ""Fantasia"" themed splash area with two small slides, but we think older kids will probably find the most to appreciate. Activities like bocce and giant chess on the lawn, a 30 foot water slide at the Riviera feature pool, Disney movie posters in foreign languages, and hidden mickeys to hunt around every corner will all go a long way toward keeping older kids engaged while parents enjoy their European escape. Story continues Biggest tip to know before you go: Be sure to snag a weekly resort schedule to make sure you don't miss any of the kid friendly activities on offer at Riviera. From build your own lego race cars for a mini grand prix on the lawn to a toy boat race to open the pool each morning to a scavenger hunt by Skyliner that takes you from Riviera to other area resorts, there's a lot to keep families busy around the property. Brooke Geiger McDonald How's the Location? Just a few months ago, Riviera would never have topped any list of best positioned Disney resorts. But, thanks to the opening of the Disney Skyliner, Disney's newest transportation system, Riviera is now a quick gondola trip to both Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios. With Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and Disney's most ambitious attraction to date, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, now open and another new ride, Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway, on the way at Hollywood Studios, plus a whole slew of new attractions in the works over at Epcot, seamless access to these two parks puts Riviera's location on par with the highly coveted ""monorail resorts"" that provide easy access to both Magic Kingdom and Epcot. For Parents: If you've ever been to Disney World, there's a good possibility you share the widespread disdain for bus transportation from the resorts to the parks. Service can be inconsistent,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buses crowded, and schlepping strollers and squirmy kiddos on them is not the most enjoyable way to start or end the day. The Skyliner changes all of this. Lines move quickly," from a thrilling whoosh at """"take off"""" and return to the station to breathtaking aerial views of Disney World from the air", the Skyliner is a ride in its own right. My kids, who moan and groan when it's time for the bus, are as excited to hop on the Skyliner as they are to ride Splash Mountain. Biggest tip to know before you go: Many of the Skyliner's gondolas feature character wraps that, while charming, seriously impact your view from inside the vehicle. If there's not a long wait, ask the cast member at boarding if you can wait for an unwrapped gondola to better take in the sights. Brooke Geiger McDonald What Are Riviera's Rooms Like? Riviera is a Disney Vacation Club (DVC) resort. DVC is Disney's vacation ownership program that operates on a flexible, points based system (cash reservations are also available). Because all of the rooms are DVC rooms, they have some extra amenities rarely found in a typical hotel room, including a microwave, refrigerator, toaster, wet bar and, depending on the room type, much more. Rooms sleep anywhere from two adults plus an infant in the Tower Studios (a warning: adding a pack and play would make these a very tight squeeze) to up to 12 guests in the massive three bedroom grand villas. For Parents: One bedroom and larger rooms come with a full kitchen, dishwasher, and washer and dryer. This means you can pack lighter, plus save money by eating some of your meals in the room. For Kids: At Riviera," queen size Inova murphy beds replace the traditional lumpy sofa beds kids are typically stuck with. The cutest part? Beds pull down to reveal whimsical original artwork created exclusively for the resort and showcasing scenes from classic animated Disney films set in Europe like """"Peter Pan"""" and """"101 Dalmations. """" A small single bed also pulls down from the wall to reveal a sleeping Mickey that kiddos will love to snooze alongside. Biggest tip to know before you go: When you book your room"," you'll have the opportunity to include special room requests such as """"first available"""" or """"high floor. """" To maximize your ease of access to the Skyliner"," request """"close to transportation. """" Some rooms are mere steps from its entrance. We timed it on our last trip and traveled via the Skyliner from Hollywood Boulevard", the main drag at Disney's Hollywood Studios, to Riviera, in less than 15 minutes. Brooke Geiger McDonald Where Can We Eat? You can't pretend you're in Europe without eating all the food, can you? Here's where to indulge your culinary wanderlust around the resort. Le Petit Caf In the morning, this Parisian style caf ," named after a spot in the 1970 animated Disney film """"The Aristocats", serves up coffee and delicious pastries. At night, the caf , located just off the lobby, transforms into a relaxed wine bar. Primo Piatto The resort's main quick service location, Primo Piatto is a firm step up from most other resort quick service spots around Disney World. Everything here is accessible to the average American palate but gets a European twist: Blueberry Lemon Pancakes are topped with mascarpone and scrambled eggs get served over mascarpone polenta with a sweet brioche roll. Of course, Mickey waffles for the kids are always an option. Lunch and dinner feature Italian classics like handmade pasta (delicious!) and hearth baked pizzas a big hit with kiddos. French fare highlights include the Croque Monsieur and, for a lighter option, the Tuna Ni oise Salad. Bar Riva While officially this is Riviera's pool bar, it doesn't feel quite fair to call it that when other deluxe resort pool bars like the one at Disney's Boardwalk Resort offer little more than a hot dog and a bag of chips or a Mickey pretzel with cheese. At this beautiful poolside space bathed in a rainbow of calming shades of blue, families can enjoy a truncated, table service version of Primo Piatto's upscale menu. Parents will want to try the inventive cocktails like the Coco Paradiso and La Petite Fleur. If your kids don't see something they want on Bar Riva's kids menu, be sure to ask. They're happy to bring you most everything that's served next door at Primo Piatto. My 6 year old highly recommends the handmade Linguine with Tomato Sauce! Topolino's Terrace Flavors of the Riviera For breakfast or dinner with a view, head to Riviera's rooftop restaurant," Topolino's Terrace (""""Topolino"""" is the Italian name for Mickey Mouse). Here", you'll find one of the best character dining experiences on property. Breakfast la Art with Mickey and Friends is a relaxing antidote to the typical chaotic buffet character breakfast. No need to stress that characters will show up at your table while you're at the buffet, at your table you'll be served fresh pastries then your choice of entrees like Quiche Gruy re, Sour Cream Waffle or Wood fired Butchers Steak. Dressed in some of our all time favorite costumes, painter Mickey, poet Minnie, sculptor Donald and dancer Daisy will all visit your table. Breakfast is a pricey affair, but at 41 for adults and 24 for kids, we think it's a pretty good value when compared to other character breakfasts on property. Dinner at Topolino's Terrace is a showstopper. Take in sweeping views across Disney World that, if you time it right, will include fireworks from both Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios. Menu standouts include the Buratta con Panna with black winter truffle, Winter Pumpkin Ravioli, Filet Mignon with truffled mashed potatoes (can you ever have too many truffles in a meal?), and my favorite, the Tarbais bean Cassoulet, a plant based take on the classic French dish, made with Beyond sausage. For parents: The character breakfast at Topolino's is a memorable experience for the whole family, but dinner is definitely a more grown up affair. While kids are welcome, parents may enjoy booking an in room sitter through Kids Nite Out, an excellent local babysitting service, to enjoy a special adults only evening. For kids: Aside from the resort's main dining locations, kids won't want to miss a scoop from Vivo Il Gelato, the poolside outpost of the world famous Florence gelato shop. Biggest tip to know before you go: When making your reservation for dinner at Topolino's Terrace, consult the park hours for Epcot and Hollywood Studios. Fireworks times typically align with park closing times, so if you time your reservation to coincide with that, you'll catch quite the show! RELATED: 17 Disney Hacks You Never Knew for a Cheaper Trip How Much Does Riviera Cost? With the elegant vibe and deluxe amenities comes a hefty price tag: Current pricing for Riviera ranges from about 400 to 4,539, depending on the room type. While this is no doubt pricey, amenities like in room kitchens and dining areas can help remove some of the sting by allowing you to save some money on meals out. Becoming a Disney Vacation Club member also makes staying at deluxe Disney resorts like Riviera much more cost effective. Our family joined several years ago and we've been able to afford far more Disney World vacations than we ever could have by booking direct with cash. Biggest tip to know before you go: When it comes to saving money at Disney World, timing is everything. Peak travel times make everything more expensive, from flights, to hotel rooms, to park tickets so if your travel dates are flexible, be sure to price out different dates for both resort rates and park tickets (you can also price both out as a package) to find the cheapest time to travel.  Harry and Meghan: what price their independence? When in the 1990s Prince Charles and palace advisers started the process of slimming down the royal family s entourage and hangers on, they could not have imagined that natural wastage rather than active culling would have reduced the inner core quite so suddenly and drastically. First Prince Andrew, now Harry and Meghan, within a couple of months, though for entirely different reasons. Less than two years ago the future of the family firm seemed assured, a seamless progression from the old guard to a new generation, with two aces in the pack: princes William and Harry with their respective spouses. The second in line was dutiful and calm, perhaps even boring in his distinctly middle aged, balding demeanour, while the younger brother made up in charm and raciness what his brother lacked in excitement. To cap it all, Harry was marrying an American actress of dual heritage perfect product placement as well as a genuine love match to keep the Windsors up with the ethnic and cultural diversity of contemporary society. Oh dear. Nineteen months on, Harry and Meghan are bailing out, overwrought and seemingly suddenly dreading the prospect of a lifetime in a bubble of privilege and publicity. Yesterday, fingers were pointing at Meghan for buckling, not being able to take it, not being a trouper, not understanding, in the patronising words of the Daily Express, that being a royal is not like being a celebrity (although, actually, it is). The media consensus was that they should be getting on with the job, of which boredom is an inescapable part: as the royal biographer AN Wilson said, it s not royalty s job to be exciting. The couple largely blamed the tabloids for their disenchantment, though the royal correspondents, as opposed to columnists, on their papers have not behaved particularly badly and nowhere near as obtrusively as they did with the prince s mother unless, that is, you think any criticism of royalty is presumptuous. As Enoch Powell said of politicians and the press, it s like a sailor blaming the weather. Or, as the Duke of Edinburgh once said, stoically: You cope. One does. Prince Andrew and now Harry and Meghan have stepped away from the Queen s realm, for very different reasons. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP That is not to say that sneers have not hovered about the flaring nostrils of some dedicated royal watchers. You can easily substitute American and dual heritage for American and twice married divorcee from the time of the abdication crisis 84 years ago. Like his great great uncle Edward VIII, Harry would probably never have dropped out but for the love of Meghan. The decision was both precipitous, if palace advisers are to be believed, and not thought through: ignoring advice to hold off and think further. How can the potential consequences now be worked out? How can Harry and Meghan play a full part in the royal routine on a part time basis, unless they become the Duke and Duchess of Frequent Flying? How can they earn their own money, sufficient to be independent, unless Meghan goes back on set and Harry is hired out to the highest bidder? Prince Charles, who largely underwrites Harry s income from Duchy of Cornwall revenues, is promising to tighten the purse strings if his son s commitment to royal duties is halved a threat that proved successful when Princess Margaret gave up her love for Peter Townsend in the 1950s in order not to lose her title or civil list money. Timeline Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle Show July 2016 The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship. 30 October 2016 News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating. 8 November 2016 Kensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its abuse and harassment of his girlfriend. 10 January 2017 Markle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London. 5 September 2017 The engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: We re two people who are really happy and in love. 24 September 2017 Markle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada although the pair sit about 18 seats apart. 19 October 2017 It emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. 22 October 2017 The prince s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018. 27 November 2017 Clarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness . 19 May 2018 The couple marry before a celebrity studded congregation at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle. 6 May 2019 The couple's first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten Windsor, is born in London. 8 January 2020 They announce that they are to step back from life as 'senior' royals, triggering a row with Buckingham Palace. 13 January 2020 After a crisis meeting with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William at Sandringham, the Queen issues a statement saying the couple will have a 'transition period' before ending their royal duties. 18 January 2020 It is announced that Harry and Meghan will drop their HRH titles and repay 2.4m of taxpayers money used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. If the Sussexes independence comes at the price of a rumoured secret deal with Disney it will be the apotheosis of the Magic Kingdom. What happens when a royal commitment interferes with a client s contractual imperative? And how will it look to the public if Harry forgoes opening a hospital in Lancing for a celebrity engagement in LA? These are genuine concerns: a sense of entitlement is the quickest way to kill public enthusiasm for royalty. The move could lead to a drop in the public s esteem for the couple. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA At its most basic, how will the costs be divvied up? Boris Johnson, or other members of the royal family, will not stump up for the recent renovation of Frogmore Cottage, but what of the security cost of protecting the couple in Canada or southern California? Will it be contracted out to the Mounties, or Los Angeles police? And if it is still handled by the Metropolitan police at enormous cost, how do those responsibilities square with local law enforcement? The royals, never slow to take offence, were insistent that the couple s plans had not been properly discussed and that the Queen and Prince Charles had been bounced by the announcement, apparently pre empted by a story in the modern court circular that is the Sun. It is never a good look not to confide in your gran, especially when she s head of the family. Yesterday, Graham Smith, of the pressure group Republic, was celebrating the forthcoming decline of the institution: its troubles can only get worse, he said. But predictions of its imminent demise may be premature. Harry, as sixth in line, was never going to be king, short of a catastrophe. Even if the Queen dies tomorrow (heaven forbid) the succession is assured: Charles III will be succeeded by William V and George VII unless there is a major swing of public opinion. Harry s absence will leave a gap in the royal rota plans maybe fewer events will be attended. They have coped before: the idea of royals as dutiful public servants is comparatively recent, only dating back to Victoria and Albert, though it has been a powerful brand. What of Harry and Meghan? They will get their way but may find it colder and less esteemed on the outside. He will go down in royal circles as a bolter, like Edward VIII, who sacrificed the concepts of service and dedication the strongest suits in the royal hand for the woman he loved.  Top Tips from Successful Disney Travel Agents  Getting Earmarked is a pinnacle of achievement that certain travel advisors shoot for, spending years building their knowledge about Disney vacation destinations, and honing their marketing and sales skills so they can reach the elite level affording them special perks and insider access. But getting to that exclusive level can be a challenge. Disney is known for only paying a straight 10% commission on the majority of its vacation products. Additionally, some advisors say, after learning insider tips from an agent assisted booking, many travelers choose to book their next Disney vacations on their own. So, what does it take to reach Earmarked status, and how can an agent profitably build their Disney sales? Travel Market Report reached out to a group of elite Disney travel advisors to ask them their best tips for success. 1. It will require a very personal love for all things Disney. I grew up going to Walt Disney World, said Tracy McCoy, with Trips to the Mouse, in Austin, Texas. Every November, we would load up the station wagon and drive down to Florida from Chicago. I have passed that love onto all four of my children. We have traveled to Disney World at least once a year since my oldest (now 19) was born. I believe so strongly in Disney destinations that selling my clients on a Disney vacation is easier my passion and knowledge is genuine. I have the Disney Obsession. I don t know how to explain it. It s my passion, said Sonya Toole Little, of Sandcastle Wishes Travel, in Kimberly, Alabama. She visits professionally, and personally with her children and husband, 10 12 times a year. The night before I m heading to Disney for a trip, I can t sleep. My kids can t sleep. Disney is the only thing we will get up at 3 in the morning for. The biggest reason we've been successful with selling Disney is because we are passionate about it, said Kelly O'Brien Ortiz, owner of Guru Travel, an Earmarked agency in Elgin, Illinois. Her agency has been selling Disney for about 10 years. We care so much, we wake up to make FastPass and dining reservations in the middle of the night, when they first become available. We actively travel to Disney destinations several times a year, not just for work, but for pleasure . we know it, we love it and we want to share it. 2. Learn how to sell up, especially as your clientele matures. As a rookie agent, your biggest mistake is to quote and price out of your own pocketbook, Toole Little said. Taking advantage of Earmarked perks like complimentary admission passes and fams, Toole Little has been able to educate herself more on Disney s higher end properties, and describes herself now as a deluxe resort snob. Give your clients the variety of options, and describe to them the benefits of staying at a deluxe resort, she said. Help them understand how the Contemporary Resort is great for families with small children in strollers, because they are not going to waste hours going back and forth to the Magic Kingdom on buses. O'Brien Ortiz recounted how, when her agency first started off, We were selling to mostly value, first time clients. As our business has grown, so have our clients. Now we have a mix of value first timers and larger multigenerational groups staying in Disney Villas or deluxe rooms. It can be hard helping clients understand why they need to stay on property versus off, O Brien Ortiz said, but the experience is that much more. Kimberly Anwar, owner and president at Magic Family Getaways, said, For clients who want a hassle free family vacation, I will sell the benefits of the Magical Disney Express (airport to resort transportation), and how it is available only to guests staying at Walt Disney World Resorts. 3. Visit as often as you can. Because I travel there so often, I am always up to date with the ever changing parks, said McCoy. I know the parks like the back of my hand. I have actually received texts from clients, mid trip, asking where the closest bathroom was to where they currently were, and I could answer without skipping a beat. McCoy has traveled with children of various ages (from 3 months up to 19 years), as well as extended family. I have honeymooned at Disney World. And I have escaped on long weekends with the girls, she said, so I know what works and what doesn t for a variety of clients. Shayla Northcutt, owner of the Northcutt Travel Agency, a Travel Leaders Network affiliate agency based in Houston, Texas, has 18 independent contractors working at her agency. All of my ICs who sell Disney, and visited at least two to three times in 2019, she said. If you are going to do a good job serving your clients, you have to go every year. It doesn t matter how many times I have been there I see something new every year that makes me a better Disney agent. 4. Develop your personal expertise. Disney bookings are about 60 75% of the sales base for Jamie Santillo, owner and founder at Adventures by Jamie, in Wesley Chapel, Florida. Santillo lives about one and a half hours from Disney World, and is striving to be Earmarked. Santillo recently took advantage of discounted agent rates to stay at the Caribbean Beach Resort to get firsthand knowledge about how to sell it to clients who use a wheelchair, like she does. When I went to the hotel, I made sure I did a Facebook Live of my room, to demonstrate the accessibility features. The room I was in was an upgraded pirate theme room, for me. That room would have been outside of my own budget, she said. As a result, I could see the room, do the tour, and over three days, do a number of Facebook Lives, capture photos and video to describe an experience I couldn t have on my own. Ashley Parker, owner at Key to Adventure Travel, in Clare, Michigan, where about 70% of their bookings are with Disney, tries to distinguish herself by promoting how she knows the ins and outs of maximizing a client s time. It might not sound like a big thing, but an advisor who understands the difference between a family stopping at a quick service restaurant at the park, versus table service, could impact their day depending on what they want to do, or when their FastPass reservations are, Parker said. I also educate my clients on things like transportation options for a dining reservation at a hotel, when they are going to be in the park all day, she said. Or if your child absolutely wants the Cinderella s Castle dining experience, but there is no availability. As long as you are okay with a backup plan, I would direct you to the Norway section at Epcot, where you can still have dinner with the princesses. 5. Develop your personal service value proposition. For Toole Little, leveraging her CRM, TESS, to trigger reminder emails for booking her clients dining and FastPass reservations, helps her deliver on her service promise of covering all of the little details. It gets hard sometimes, because it is so competitive trying to retain your clients, to find loyalty for Disney reservations. I ve seen clients lured away by a 25 gift card. So, you have to define why someone should purchase from you, Toole Little said. There are some agents who will hand clients an itinerary and send them on their way, Anwar said. We want our clients downloading the My Disney Experience app on their phone, and we ll spend time teaching them how to use it. It s part of our booking process. I think it s that king of handholding that leads to our referrals. I ve seen people write on social media: I booked with Kim. They will teach you the tips and tricks. 6. Find other vacation styles Disney clients will purchase. Northcutt sees Disney as a way to bring in new clients. You can t sell just Disney. I want a client who I can plan every vacation for them, someone who also is open to going somewhere exotic. So, she leverages Disney s popularity as a way to meet and wow customers looking for the extra service and attention that will bring them back for ocean cruises and other higher commission vacations. O Brien Ortiz agrees. Disney is like a rite of passage. When a child is born, most parents begin dreaming of their first trip to Disney with their child, she said. Anwar upsells land only clients to Disney cruises when she feels the time is right. 7. Be persistent and growth will come. Have patience, said Anwar. It took me three to four years of hard work, every day, every year, to get to this level. It took me reaching out to my BDMs to sponsor movie nights, run postcard campaigns, learn how to use Disney s e brochures effectively. It s easier to sell it now, with all of the growth in properties and attractions, said Northcutt. Now, it s mostly about qualifying the client for their budget, where they want to stay. The variety offers every agent opportunity, because with so many options, consumers need an educated agent to help them put together the right elements.  Disneyland, dissected: The hosts of Podcast: The Ride unpack their theme park obsession Bestcasts asks podcasters to discuss the most memorable episodes of their podcast. For more podcast coverage, see Podmass, The A. V. Club s weekly roundup of the best casts out there. As a medium unconfined by things like shooting schedules or even studio space, podcasting especially chatter based series often release episodes at a relentless clip. This sheer volume of content naturally rewards fans of the most inconsequential minutiae, made clear by the proliferation of the minute by minute breakdown podcast, the watch the same movie again and again format, the track by track album analysis. But perhaps more than any other series, Podcast: The Ride wears trivial details like a badge of honor. Advertisement The show, which debuted in 2017, brings three Los Angeles comedians together to bond over a shared obsession with theme parks. Each week, Mike Carlson, Scott Gairdner, and Jason Sheridan three childless men in their 30s, they re unafraid to point out select a theme park ride to discuss in often uncomfortable depth. Except on those occasions when there s no ride discussed at all. The crew has dissected everything from entire defunct theme parks across the country to the inexplicably resilient Waterworld stunt show to the Tangled themed bathrooms at Disney s Magic Kingdom. In all cases, their enthusiasm is unwavering, and their dogged pursuit of the truth turns up more delightful discoveries than a family vacation ever could. Mickey And Friends Parking Structure with Nick Wiger The A. V. Club: This is an episode entirely about a parking garage at Disneyland. Was this the first of your wanderings into the truly mundane? Jason Sheridan: I think that started with episode one. Advertisement Mike Carlson: There s very mundane things in every episode, for sure. The Mickey And Friends parking structure was actually Nick Wiger s suggestion. It felt like a gift, because it gave us license to get as hyperspecific and boring as possible, to really explore the lesser talked about aspects of all this stuff. Scott Gairdner: It exploded out of the possibility of how mundane the topic can be, but also issued a really good dare. There can be too much to talk about with a classic ride with so much mythology that s why we re parsing out The Haunted Mansion on a yearly basis, covering it every Halloween season, because there s too much to possibly contain in one episode. AVC: How dare you, by the way. SG: I like when we get an episode that seems like a challenge. When it seems like there s so little meat on the bone, it really dares you to look at what seems like a simple object from every possible angle. In the case of Mickey And Friends, in talking about Disney just building a giant parking structure, you don t just want to talk about the colors and the elevators and the stairs. We unraveled this whole pretty interesting story about Disney s struggle to purchase land in the area and figure out where to build a parking structure, and it ties into the story of WestCOT, the previous park they were trying to build before California Adventure. Advertisement Then Disney played Long Beach and Anaheim against each other, essentially saying, if you don t build us a parking garage, we will bail and go to Long Beach and not build our second California park in Anaheim. So the further you unravel the thread, it s not just the parking structure. There s also all this insane mythology of Disney s political wheelings and dealings. JS: We pretty quickly found out that there s always some sort of story there, either by Disney s design and insistence on there being an official company story, or just that they had to get this off the ground somehow, and it s very rare that it gets off the ground exactly how they d planned. There are usually some unforeseen complications that are interesting. SG: We have fun planning these episodes, because the three of us all do our research and prep in advance. There will be episodes where one of us will say, Do you guys have anything? Because I m blank. And then one of the others will say, Oh yeah, I ve got something. And then somebody s just got this treasure trove of knowledge that the others didn t expect. And then there s times where we all have way too much. We all attempt to surprise each other with every episode in what we re bringing to the table, and this was a good example of that. Obviously, Nick Wiger s a fantastic guest, and his podcast Doughboys is undeniably an influence on our show. The level of fun that he and Doughboys co host Mike Mitchell are clearly having every week made a lot of people go, Maybe there s this new way to do podcasts that s casual and organic, and fun as hell. Advertisement Maybe there s this new way to do podcasts that s casual and organic and fun as hell. Failed Parks Part 2: Hard Rock Park with Jason Woliner JS: Jason Woliner had pitched two ideas the Sid and Marty Krofft Park is not as well documented as Hard Rock Park. But they both turned out to be interesting, and we were going so long, we decided to cut this into two episodes. SG: For anyone who doesn t know this story: Hard Rock Park was a Hard Rock Caf themed park that I remember seeing updates on for many years. Once every couple weeks, there d be a new update on the construction of Hard Rock Park: Oh, they re breaking ground, and look, there s a Mount Rushmore composed of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. Wow, this thing s really coming along. Oh, now it s open. Eight months later: It s closed already? It closed so instantly in 2008 2008 being the financial collapse. This odd park with a really flawed premise closed probably faster than any theme park in history. Advertisement AVC: What makes this episode great? SG: I might go so far as to say that Hard Rock Park is the most surprisingly interesting topic we ve ever landed on, and all three of us were doing our research that day thinking, Okay, there will be a couple fun things to talk about. And then the hours passed and the hours passed, and we all arrived for the recording. We were all stressed out as if we were preparing for an AP test, cramming all night. All three of us were in the same sweaty state of, that was so much work and I don t even think I got it all. We were all panicked that we had not discovered all of the inane details of Hard Rock Park. Once we started laying them out, there was too much. We were shocked at what an onslaught of inanity it was. JS: That was the first instance of feeling nostalgic for a place I ve never been and can now never go to. I wish I could ve seen Hard Rock Park in 2008 Myrtle Beach. The thing that was made, and the stuff that was never made, too. They had such grand plans for expansion right from the start, condos and different rides and lands and a wedding chapel. It was truly ambitious and also very misguided. That was the first instance of feeling nostalgic for a place I ve never been and can now never go to. Advertisement MC: Hard Rock Park is a perfect marriage between so many different things that we all like. The behind the scenes drama, shady financiers JS: Big personalities MC: Rock and roll related anything. There was a ride that was the Moody Blues ride, Nights In White Satin, based kind of on their song Nights In White Satin. It supposedly was a very good ride. JS: It was nonlinear and very dreamlike. Advertisement MC: There were also original Hard Rock Park characters. When I found out there was a character named Winston The Punk Rock Dog, I was very excited and ready to talk at least 15 minutes about it. It was such a perfect storm of everything we like talking about. AVC: Do your guests participate in the research, or are they just there to chat about their personal experience with the ride or park in question? JS: It s up to them, whether or not they want to. We don t ask anyone to do it we say that we take care of the research. But some guests have started digging. SG: I m interested in hearing people s weird childhood stories and why rides are resonant for them. So we certainly don t hold people to the research standard. However, when there is a guest who comes in with research, I am so impressed and delighted. I specifically have to shout out Eva Anderson, who joined us for the Downtown Disney Ordeal. That was some of the most copious research a guest has come in with. Advertisement JS: Chris Cantwell, co creator of Halt And Catch Fire, came on when we did Dogpatch USA, a park based on the comic strip Li l Abner by Al Capp. Cantwell had been there, and that was another episode where we started finding out a lot of weird stuff about the property and the history of the park. SG: Both Hard Rock and Dogpatch USA involved a demented man singularly pushing this theme park. Weird, alternative universe Walt Disneys who see themselves as a Walt, and their idea is as crazy as Walt s was: Disneyland seemed really crazy when it started, but he carried it through, and if he can do it, then I can! And we ve found these figures who haven t been able to. JS: Historical tastes and contexts are always interesting, too. When Dogpatch opened, Li l Abner was read in dozens of newspapers, hundreds, even, around the world, by millions of people every day. When Li l Abner got married, it was on the cover of Life magazine. Now, it s mostly remembered because high schools do a musical version of it sometimes? Podcast: The Ride Live with Tony Baxter Advertisement AVC: When did working with Disney Imagineer Tony Baxter become a possibility? SG: Former guest Paul Scheer put it all together. He was asked to do a live show at an exhibit called That s From Disneyland, in which an agent named Richard Kraft was selling his entire collection of Disney memorabilia. He said, You have to have these guys from Podcast: The Ride. They would freak out to get to do a show here. So not only did Richard and his son Nicky Kraft invite us to come do a show there which is pretty bold, considering this was our first ever live show they also said, Who do you want? Who would be an ideal guest for you? MC: I said Tony Baxter. He said, Well, we re friends with him. SG: Tony Baxter was someone I admired when I was a child. We list his credits in the episode, but it s all the greats of the 80s and 90s: Big Thunder Mountain, Star Tours, Euro Disney, Indiana Jones Adventure. He s like the primary visionary behind the next generation of Imagineering. He was a very special figure to us. It felt like a long shot. Advertisement MC: When we started doing this show, I made some sort of bold proclamation that we should have Tony Baxter within a year or two. That was already something we wanted to happen, but we didn t know exactly how it was going to come about, because it wasn t like we were going to run into him even though, actually, funny enough, we did run into him at Disneyland once. SG: That s the level of fan we are. We were walking from Disneyland to California Adventure, and I m feverishly whispering, That s Tony Baxter! That s Tony Baxter! We d love to have more Imagineers on, the people responsible for these rides. People who currently work at Disney Imagineering have a press clampdown. Disney has to approve of anything they do, so it makes it tough to scale the wall. We re thankful we were able to have Tony, who s retired and can say whatever he wants. That s the cool thing in this episode: He was doing a little bit of shit talk. We were very surprised and delighted by some of the things he was willing to say with us. It was also really fun because there s a lot of avenues where Tony Baxter speaks. He does a lot of live panels and he s been on other podcasts, like Season Pass. And he s in The Imagineering Story, which is going over so well on Disney right now. He s fascinating to listen to, but we noticed he has go to stories and sound bites that he says a lot. We said, It won t be Mission Accomplished to have him on this comedy podcast if we don t break out of the shell and do something that only we would do. Advertisement So, getting to pitch him, step by step, a very inane Apple Dumpling Gang ride that would stretch from Disneyland to Knott s Berry Farm and go along the 5 freeway I can t remember more fun I ve had doing this podcast. Here s this luminary, and we re wasting his time with this nonsense. And he s playing along! He s adding jokes and giving us serious criticism. He said, Here s the notes I would give in a boardroom. He played a comedy game with us. AVC: Would you say that more ride pitches are in your future? MC: We re throwing ideas out all the time. I m sure there will be more. Honestly, I m secretly hoping we can get a job in one of these companies, to actually make a ride. We re hoping to goof our way into a job eventually. I also think it s not out of the question that we ll become three behind the scenes people involved in the resurrection of Hard Rock Park, if Hard Rock Park comes back somewhere in the world. Advertisement SG: We also just learned about a Hard Rock Caf animated series that never came to fruition called Hard Rock Rascals. It would ve been like a Muppet Babies of Elvis and John Lennon. The strangest idea. But, as often comes up on shows, I genuinely would love to make that. MC: Can we buy the rights to this theme park character that no one remembers anymore? That s a common refrain on the show. JS: That, and stuff that didn t end up being built, the most famous of which was a ride called Dick Tracy s Crime Stoppers, where you, the guest, would ve gotten in a police car, been given a gun, and gone through the city to shoot at criminals. Monster faced criminals, like the Dick Tracy bad guys. But then that movie wasn t the biggest movie of the year, so it didn t end up happening. MC: It s all weird, corporate timing, and whether something was too far along to cancel it by the time the movies bombed. That stuff is all very interesting. You re in the parks now and you ask, How is there no Mary Poppins ride, but there s a Roger Rabbit ride? It s weird politics, where the companies were at at the time, what they were building already. Advertisement JS: How did they not just fast track rides to Aladdin, Beauty And The Beast, and The Lion King, when those were all hits? It s all just tertiary stuff. MC: We put this episode on our list because it s a good representation of another element of the show: true earnestness that might be coated in sarcasm or irony. It s the purest you ll hear us, in a lot of ways, because we re truly just asking a guy who created a bunch of stuff we love earnest questions. Overall, a lot of listeners are picking up on the fact that, as much as we re ready to goof around about every single aspect of all this stuff, we really do love stuff like Winston The Punk Rock Dog. We love stupid animal mascot characters and robots and rides. AVC: You never trash things for fun, like a bad movies podcast might. JS: There s definitely stuff that s mind boggling or frustrating, or things that just didn t work and are awful. But we try to give stuff its due. A lot of people love this, so who are we to say? Advertisement SG: I feel very lucky that we all found a topic to do a podcast about that we legitimately care about. It fuels us to keep going and makes it not feel like work. The worst case scenario is if you arbitrarily pick some topic that seems funny for a podcast, then you get 10 episodes in and say, Oh God, I don t care about this at all. JS: I m trapped! SG: What keeps this podcast going is that we truly love this stuff. We want to goof and do riffs and let you know who we are on the edges, but the root of it is that we just love talking about theme parks very much. We were all essentially doing this for no one, or for uninterested wives and girlfriends, completely on our own and probably will still when we re someday not doing the podcast.  Planning a trip to Orlando: Visiting Disney World or Universal Resorts? Planning a trip to Orlando: Visiting Disney World or Universal Resorts? How to best organize for the family and take advantage of parks and theme experiences. Visiting the main theme parks and staying inside them are some of the tips to enjoy a world where little ones have fun and adults reconnect with their inner child. Visiting the wonderful world of Disney is a trip that the whole family can enjoy. Sometimes, travelers believe that organizing a trip to Orlando can be more difficult than planning other adventures, due to the variety of accommodations and attractions that must be booked in advance. Therefore, today we have prepared 5 tips to help you make the best of your trip in Orlando. What is the best time to travel? During June, July and August is the high season where temperatures are high and there are many tourists. During December, January and February you can enjoy cooler nights and warmer days. Choosing one season or another depends on the tastes the traveler has regarding temperatures, the number of tourists and special events. April and May are the low season months where the number of tourists decreases remarkably and for those who prefer to enjoy a quiet time, it is a very good opportunity. However, during September and October Halloween events take place where parks such as Magic Kingdom or Universal Studios organize magical and special theme nights. How to move around The quickest and most convenient way to move around Orlando and between each park is without a doubt by car. Even more so if you re visiting with the family. Thus, renting a car in Orlando is recommended because it will allow you to control how on time you are for each park activity and also give you the chance to see the rest of Orlando at your own pace. How to choose accommodation You can choose between staying inside Disney parks or in the city of Orlando. Tourists who decide to stay within the parks get additional hours in them, and other benefits, to have more fun time at selected attractions and experiences. On accommodation platforms you can find the best accommodation options in Orlando for an unforgettable vacation. What are the parks to visit? Disney has two water parks and four theme parks Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Magic and Animal Kingdom . On the other hand, Universal Orlando Resort has a water park and two theme parks Universal and Islands of Adventure. Depending on the month chosen for the visit, you can enjoy the water parks or not because they are closed during the low season. Other tips Arrive half an hour in advance to get good places in the shows, plan activities in the parks to make the most of the time, it is recommended to go to Magic Kingdom for two days to get to know each of its corners. All the parks have free hydration points so it is not necessary to carry extra weight carrying bottles. To walk the ideal is to go with sports shoes since you ll walk many kilometers inside the parks. Also, Orlando is a destination that has great outlets and incredible promotions to make purchases, so it is ideal to carry a large suitcase with space.  At Magic Kingdom, tourists forget they brought a gun  He had bought the gun for his wife to carry as protection a couple years ago, the incident report said. They apologized stating they forgot to leave it in the hotel room and asked if they could secure the gun somewhere in the park . They forgot the gun was in the purse when they left to come on the family vacation because they have 18 family members attending the trip and had many bags.

When the Sun Sets Over Disney World, the Real Fun Begins Most visitors to Walt Disney World are up at the crack of dawn to be one of the first through the gates at the resort s amusement parks. Somehow, though, certain magical Disney moments are made even more enchanting as the sun sets and gives way to twilight. On your next trip, skip the early morning alarm for at least one day, sleep in, and maybe drink an extra cup of coffee so that you can rally into the wee hours (well, for Disney anyway) because there are some Disney experiences that are best enjoyed at night. 1. Fly up, up, and away in a (tethered) hot air balloon. If you ve ever wondered if you can actually go up in the big, blue hot air balloon at Disney Springs, the answer is yes. The Aerophile, the world s largest tethered hot air balloon, is open anytime you visit Disney Springs, but the nighttime views are beyond compare. When you top out at 400 feet, you ll catch a glimpse of both Magic Kingdom and Epcot (and the surrounding hotels) and, if you time it right, you may get your own private fireworks viewing. The balloon holds up to 29 people (plus a pilot), and tickets, which are 20 for adults and 15 for children, are available on a first come, first served basis. 2. Get down with Chip n Dale at a campfire sing along. Even if you aren t staying at Disney s Fort Wilderness Resort Campground, it ll be worth your time to mosey on over for a rollicking evening of marshmallow roasting, campfire songs, and a Disney movie under the stars with Chip n Dale. Held nightly, Chip n Dale s Campfire Sing A Long is one of the few character meet and greet opportunities that don t require a park ticket or dining reservations. For a totally free evening, you can bring your own marshmallows, or you can purchase a s mores kit from the nearby Chuckwagon Snack Bar. Both the campfire and the outdoor movie are subject to cancellation if bad weather strikes, so check in with Guest Services if dark skies are on the horizon.

Disney World may not be known for its nightclub scene, but that doesn t mean there aren t a few spots where you can have a little over 21 fun. Jellyrolls, located at Disney s Boardwalk, is a lively dueling piano bar where audience participation is highly encouraged. It has a full bar menu, but your best bet is a bright and colorful cocktail (Purple Rain, anyone?) in one of its refillable tumblers. Seating is limited, so you ll have to get there early if you want to be guaranteed a good seat near the stage. There s also plenty of standing room to be found. Jellyrolls is open daily from 7:00 PM to 2:00 AM, which is also the same time Disney s resort hotel buses stop running. If you re planning on staying until closing, research your transportation options ahead of time. Both Uber and Lyft are available throughout Disney World. 4. Embark on an evening safari. Disney s Starlight Safari gives guests a unique nighttime opportunity to observe the animals who roam the savanna area surrounding Disney s Animal Kingdom Lodge. With the help of a rugged safari vehicle, night vision goggles, and a knowledgeable guide, you ll get a glimpse of zebra, giraffes, antelopes, and more than 20 exotic animal species and their habitats. Advanced reservations are recommended for the Starlight Safari, which is held twice nightly at a cost of 74.17 per person. 5. Charter a private fireworks cruise on a yacht. Even if you aren t living the yacht life at home, a Disney World vacation seems like the perfect reason to splurge. While there are certainly more economical options, there is nothing more indulgent than chartering Disney s Grand 1 Yacht for an intimate nighttime cruise, complete with an unmatched view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks, an onboard meal, and your own private butler (for an additional fee). This swanky yacht does seat up to 18 people, so the 399 per hour base price really isn t so bad if you share the cost with friends. You ll want to call Disney well in advance to book this exclusive experience and the aforementioned extras. 6. Indulge your foodie tendencies with a progressive dinner. Disney World makes it easy to create your own food (or drink) crawls an evening spent traveling from hotel to hotel via Disney transportation while sampling various meal and beverage options along the way. For a truly top of the line dining experience, however, you ll want to embark on what is undoubtedly the most delicious Monorail ride ever taken, the Highway in the Sky Dinearound. This progressive dinner shuttles you from course to course around Disney s Deluxe (i. e. fanciest) resorts Disney s Contemporary, Polynesian Village, and Grand Floridian. Your evening will end with a nightcap of desserts, cordials, and coffee with a view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks. The cost of this popular culinary adventure is 170 per person and it books up quickly, so advance reservations are strongly recommended. 7. Shut down the Magic Kingdom in style. Short lines and unobstructed views are hard to come by at Disney World, but Disney After Hours events get you just that and more. Held on select nights throughout the year, tickets start at 129 per person for these limited ticket specials. Disney allows far fewer guests in for these events than it does during regular business hours, so you can hit all your favorite rides as many times as you d like. There s also free unlimited yes, unlimited ice cream, popcorn, and select non alcoholic beverages available at food courts throughout the park. You ll enter Magic Kingdom in the early evening (times vary by date) and stay until midnight or 1:00 AM (again, dependent on date).  Walt Disney and unintentional transcendence We re wired to seek Divine Beauty, Truth, and the Good, and unless we trample it down it will keep calling us. If you ask people to describe Disney in a few words, you might hear: creative, kitschy, attention to detail, stimulating, commercial, innovative, but it s unlikely you ll hear the word transcendent beyond or above the range of human experience. I recently read a fascinating account of how Disneyland was conceived and built in Anaheim, California: Disney s Land by Richard Snow, packed with amazing stories and people. There was practically zero spiritual dimension to this chronicle, but beneath everything was a man, albeit imperfect, with a deeply rooted yearning to express the beautiful and the good in his work. Though Disney was a successful businessman, he often embarked on projects that few, if any, thought would be commercial successes, the film Fantasia and Disneyland prominent among them. In fact, everyone he consulted about the concept of Disneyland, family and business associates alike, thought it was foolish, and certainly a money loser, as amusement parks had acquired a reputation for being unprofitable and seedy. When someone suggested Disney had built Disneyland solely to make money, a man who worked on the project responded that at the time it seemed like nothing but a get poor quick scheme. Costs kept escalating, Disney kept demanding more attention to detail, and the audience for Disneyland was uncertain would anyone come? In those days, few were clamoring for a new high priced amusement park. When Augustine said, My heart is restless and it shall not rest until it rests in Thee, he wasn t only referring to himself or to others explicitly seeking God, but all men and women who pursue earthly beauty, truth, and the good, because we re wired to seek Divine Beauty, Truth, and the Good, and unless we trample it down it will keep calling us. Nothing I ve read suggests Walt Disney was a religious man but this yearning resided within him too, expressing itself in the beauty, truth, and good he instilled in many of his films and in Disneyland, imperfect as they were. Such works might be called unintentional transcendence. What was so beautiful and good about Disneyland? Built in the 1950s when progress in America meant more freeways, parking lots, far flung tract suburbs, downtowns decaying and dying, Disney s Park idealized America s turn of the century Main Street, a symbol of community and solidarity. Notwithstanding the forced perspective that made it appear taller than it was, his colorful and winsome castle seemed to soar to the heavens. Moreover, the beautiful grounds in the Park that went far beyond mere landscaping contrasted with what was happening in much of 1950s America where concrete, asphalt, and pipes were effacing forests, fields, and streams. What Disney seemed to be asking is why can t we have both liberty and community, both healthy commerce and natural beauty? Disney s Land suggests that revitalized main streets in many American towns were inspired in part by what people experienced in Disneyland. In a small way, I helped Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino s Pizza, with Ave Maria University in southwest Florida, and for several years I worked in his vast Domino s Farms office park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The beauty and attention to detail that went into Domino s Farms at Monaghan s insistence: natural, dynamic beauty, including the grounds and bison, art gallery, chapel, half mile plus copper roof, Frank Lloyd Wright and other museums along Main Street , could never have anticipated a commercial payback, but as with Disney he insisted on incorporating beauty and the good that transcended commercial considerations. In Monaghan s case, Domino s Farms transcendence was intentional, even more so with Ave Maria University and its grand Oratory. A closing observation about Walt Disney and unintentional transcendence. If he hadn t been determined to create Disneyland in spite of all the naysayers, if it hadn t succeeded beyond his wildest imagination prompting the search for a site for a second Disneyland with vastly more acreage, if Walt Disney World in Orlando hadn t been built, if a small chapel hadn t been constructed nearby to serve the throngs of visitors, then the beautiful Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary, Queen of the Universe that replaced the small chapel and sits a few miles from the Magic Kingdom would not have come to be, reminding us that unintentional transcendence need not mean purposeless transcendence.

Disney World or Disneyland: which mega theme park is best for you? Photo by Joshua Sudock/Disneyland Resort Article content It s the time of the year when many Canadians are plotting a trip south of the border and if you ve got a family (or even if you don t) that trip may revolve around, or at least include a visit to, a theme park. While Harry Potter fanatics may be drawn to Universal Studios and country music lovers might have their eye on Dollywood, for many of us, Disney remains the top choice for theme park vacations.

Article content If you ve never been to a Disney park before, know that the company really does set the standard when it comes to an all encompassing experience. Many a Disney cynic has been instantaneously converted as they walk through the front gates of any Disney park. Despite long lines and overtired kids, Disney somehow has figured out how to engineer legitimate joy the combination of the music, the cleanliness, the creativity of the rides and the exuberance of the characters sets the scene for authentically good moods. It s an odd and sometimes unexpected phenomenon, and the reason why so many people who don t even have children flock to Disney parks all over the world. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Disney World or Disneyland: which mega theme park is best for you? Back to video North Americans have two convenient choices for that Disney experience: Disney World in Orlando, Florida and the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Most Canadians choose their park based on which side of the country they re flying in from, but it s important to note that there are some big differences between the two properties. Size and Scope Photo by Disney World Disney World is far bigger than Disneyland. Each site has multiple parks: there are six parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney s Hollywood Studios and Disney s Animal Kingdom, as well as two water parks) at Disney World and only two at Disneyland (the original Disneyland as well as California Adventure Park). One could conceivably go to Disneyland for just one day and hit most of the highlights at both parks, which are just across the street from each other, whereas doing all of Disney World in one day (or even over the course of several days) is impossible, both because of the number of parks and the distance between them. Strictly speaking, the main parks Disneyland (California) and The Magic Kingdom (Florida) are fairly similar, albeit with different layouts. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Going from park to park requires either separate admission tickets or a costly park hopper pass, so no matter which resort you choose it s important to do some research and decide which attractions are of most interest so that you can plan your days and also buy the appropriate tickets. The enormity of Disney World can be overwhelming to navigate and those who have younger children or just crave simplicity may prefer the less is more approach of Disneyland. Hotels Photo by Matt Stroshane/Disney World The scope of the two parks also means that Disney World is positioned as a self contained resort, whereas Disneyland is more integrated into downtown Anaheim. Disneyland only has three affiliated hotels, though there are plenty of other hotels within walking distance from the park gates. Anaheim is also a relatively short drive from Los Angeles and the coastal beach communities, so it s possible to make a Disney day trip part of a larger California vacation without switching hotels. Disney World, on the other hand, features more than 20 on site resort hotels that offer a truly immersive Disney experience. Guests can stay at an African themed lodge that overlooks exotic animals, Polynesian style villas, old school Florida beach clubs or other fantastical options. Staying on park at both Disney World and Disneyland usually comes with perks like early entrance to the parks. Vibe Photo by Scott Brinegar/Disneyland When it comes down to it, your Disney park preference is going to come down to time, how much you re willing to spend, and personality. On paper, Disney World is bigger, more exciting, and offers a more well rounded vacation, but once you factor in all the days it takes to fully explore the four parks (and possibly the water parks) and the cost of staying on site, it is a fairly significant commitment. But if you want to go full Disney, it s the best bet. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Even when you factor in the adjacent California Adventure Park, Disneyland is much more manageable, but as the original Disney park, it s also got a very appealing nostalgic vibe that the Magic Kingdom hasn t been able to replicate. The old school attractions like It s a Small World and the Mad Tea Party are essentially the same at both main parks, but Disneyland just feels more quaint. For many Disneyland fanatics, that intangible is what makes all the difference. More On This Topic Wandering around West Hollywood Why it's worth road tripping from Western Canada to your U.

Kylie Jenner & Travis Scott Reunite For Disney World Playdate With Stormi & Kardashians — Pics Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner made it a girls day out when they took Penelope, Stormi, and North to Disney World along with Stormi s dad Travis Scott! Kylie Jenner,22, and Travis Scott,28, may not be together, but they re amazing co parents! The former couple were seen treating their adorable 1 year old daughter Stormi to a fun filled day at Walt Disney World on Jan. 22. The trio were seen going for a magical ride on Peter Pan s Flight, and were bundled up for the cool 53 degree weather. Stormi rocked a cozy pink outfit, while Travis was comfy in a black puffer jacket and neon green hoodie. Kourtney Kardashian,40, also joined the group and the whole family looked like they were having loads of fun. Kourt brought along daughter Penelope Disick,7, and six year old niece, North West. Joined by grandma Kris Jenner,64, the excited girls skipped along through the House of Mouse as they stopped for some photos in Fantasyland at Rapunzel s Tower, where they hopefully got to meet the Tangled princess herself. Even if they didn t, the day was a win they never had to wait in those brutal lines to get on rides or meet characters! The KarJenner ladies all looked cute for their day at the Florida theme park. North and Penelope were wearing what looked like the same outfit in different colors: a pair of satin paisley pants and a matching shirt. They both had their hair in pigtails, but North rocked a pair of gold Minnie Mouse ears with her outfit. Kourtney and Kylie looked cool in dark sunglasses, with Kylie wearing a cool, tie dyed longline coat, and Kourtney donning her favorite leather trench coat. Kris, per usual, looked chic in an all black ensemble, including combat boots. Check out their outfits in the photos below, obtained by TMZ! Kourtney and her kids are a fixture at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which is located just over an hour away from their home in Los Angeles. The last time she was spotted at the Magic Kingdom was in December 2019, when she spent the day with her on again love, Younes Bendjima. Kourtney brought the model,26, along for a fun day with her youngest son, Reign Disick, and the five year old looked like he was having a blast. Kourtney and Younes spent their Disneyland date trying to keep a low profile, but it didn t work. At one point, they were reportedly sharing some PDA before hitting up the Toy Story ride in Tomorrowland. Thought Kourtney s eldest son, Mason Disick, hasn t been on her two most recent Disney days, she s having plenty of fun with the 10 year old at home. Mason just discovered TikTok. And so did Kourtney, much to his chagrin. See her make the ultimate mom cameo in his video here! Epcot’s makeover: Here’s the latest on new attractions Among the three minor attractions that just opened at Epcot is a short film that creates a Beauty and the Beast Sing Along. It s only 14 minutes long and doesn t introduce any new characters. But this twisted tale LaFou is the hero of this version is one of the first projects to be completed in a makeover that signals a new direction for Disney World s second oldest park. The makeover itself is extensive the largest transformation of any park we have ever undertaken, says Bob Chapek, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. And it s timely: Long the second place Disney World park in terms of attendance, behind Magic Kingdom, it was overtaken by Animal Kingdom in 2018 with the opening of Pandora The World of Avatar, and it could be bumped into last place by the 2019 opening of Star Wars: Galaxy s Edge at Hollywood Studios. Many of the changes are to be completed by Oct. 1,2021, the 50th anniversary of the opening of Disney World, but if not, there s always the 40th anniversary of Epcot Oct. 1, 2022 to shoot for. While some major attractions are being added, the biggest change will be to the tenor of the park. Fictional characters and settings from Disney movies will play a much greater role at the new Epcot. That s a big switch in a park that historically has featured the cultures and customs of other countries in World Showcase and rides that emphasize discovery and adventure in Future World. Put another way, Epcot has mostly been a venue for nonfiction and adventure, while Disney World s three other parks focus on fiction and intellectual properties like Star Wars, Donald Duck and Mary Poppins. Putting Beauty and the Beast in the France Pavilion is not the first step in that change, but it demonstrates the Walt Disney Co. s enthusiasm about bringing fiction to Epcot in a big way. New attractions will include both. Among intellectual properties are the Guardians of the Galaxy roller coaster and Ratatouille dark ride, which are already under construction and a Mary Poppins attraction that Disney has not revealed details about. On the education/discovery side are a walk through trail, Journey of Water, inspired by the movie Moana a pavilion that will be the new center of Epcot s popular festivals and a play pavilion, which Disney describes as an interactive city bursting with games, activities and experiences. When Chapek announced the Ratatouille and Guardians of the Galaxy rides 2 years ago, he said they were part of changes that would make Epcot more timeless, more relevant, more family friendly, and more Disney. Disney executives have been using that line to describe the new Epcot ever since. The newest application of that phrase is to Future World, which Disney announced last year will be reorganized into three lands themed as nature, discovery and celebration. Planning your weekend?

To the left would be World Discovery, which will bring science, technology and intergalactic adventure to life. It will include Mission: Space, the new Space 220 restaurant, Test Track, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind roller coaster and the play pavilion. And in the center is World Celebration, which will offer new experiences that connect guests to one another and the world around them. It includes Spaceship Earth, which will be significantly upgraded a three level pavilion that will be home base for Epcot s festivals and a revamped entrance and plaza. Completion dates for some of the projects haven t been announced, especially those tied to the reorganization of Future World. Here s what we know about the timeline for the makeover: JANUARY Three films debuted Jan. 17, which was also opening day of the Epcot International Festival of the Arts: Beauty and the Beast Sing Along in the France pavilion is a short, twisted version of the 1991 film and will lead guests through five songs from the movie s score. It will alternate with a second film in the France theater, Impressions de France . Given the success of the Frozen Sing Along at Hollywood Studios, we wanted to do something unique, Tom Fitzgerald of Walt Disney Imagineering told a group of journalists who got a sneak peek at the film last month. One of the biggest challenges, he said, was How do you take this story that is so beloved and pare it down to a short story? Don Hahn, producer of the 1991 film, also produced the 14 minute film, which combines new animation with old. The story still revolves around a beautiful girl and a hideous beast who fall in love and break a spell, with narration by Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury). The twist? In this version, LaFou brings together Belle and the Beast. Awesome Planet , which is about Earth, replaces Circle of Life in the pavilion called the Land. Canada Far and Wide in Circle Vision 360 is an updated version of the previous O Canada film with new scenes, a new musical score and new narration. It appears in the Canada pavilion. FEBRUARY The opening of Space 220, a space themed restaurant next to Mission: Space, has been delayed and now is scheduled for an unspecified date in February. The restaurant, supposedly set on a space station 220 miles above Earth, will have panoramic views of space. It is accessed by an elevator with a view down its center that shows Epcot getting smaller as the elevator rises. It is billed as offering modern American cuisine. EARLY 2020 Spaceship Earth is to be refurbished and is to get new scenes, new narration and a new musical score that will involve temporarily closing the attraction. A news release says guests will follow a magical story light that brings the entire experience to life in dynamic ways, giving each scene energy and beauty that tie the entire journey together. Disney has not said when it will close or for how long, but park watchers say it s likely to start the first quarter of this year and take two years or longer. Liberty Inn in the American Adventure pavilion is being replaced by a barbecue restaurant, the Regal Eagle Smokehouse, inspired by Sam the Eagle, the Muppet known for his patriotism and strict sense of duty. An opening date has not been announced, only that it will be this winter. MAY 2020 Epcot s long running light and music show, Illuminations, closed last fall and was replaced by a temporary new show, Epcot Forever. That show is slated to end and a permanent new show, HarmonioUS, will open in May at the World Showcase Lagoon. With technology 20 years newer than Illuminations had and closer to Rivers of Light in Animal Kingdom, HarmonioUS will feature large floating set pieces, custom built LED panels, kites with special effects, choreographed moving fountains, lights, pyrotechnics and lasers, according to Disney. SUMMER 2020 The construction going on at the France pavilion will more than double its size, with the addition of the new ride, Remy s Ratatouille Adventure, and a new restaurant, La Creperie de Paris. Guests will ride in bewhiskered mouse shaped cars on a trackless course. Disney pixie dust will shrink riders to the size of a rat, and they ll see Gusteau s Restaurant from a rat s eye point of view. As they skid along the floor in trackless vehicles, the same technology used for the escape in Rise of the Resistance in Galaxy s Edge, riders will see giant food 7 ton hams and 25 foot fish hanging from the ceiling, giant apples and oranges and enormous containers of olive oil. We re trying to tell the story of Remy cooking for guests, said Mike Davie, an Imagineer. It is one of the most immersive environments I can think of. FUTURE OPENINGS Disney hasn t announced debut dates for the other attractions underway at Epcot, but here s what s in the works. Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind: This roller coaster is promised by the 50th anniversary of Magic Kingdom in 2021. It will be the first of its kind and will feature cars that can turn up to 360 degrees to bring riders face to face with the action. It s a dark ride that runs through the former Universe of Energy pavilion as well as a new 12 story building that is well along. Disneyland in California has a completely different Guardians ride that took over that park s version of Tower of Terror. In Orlando, Tower of Terror is untouched. Mary Poppins: Disney hasn t said what this new attraction will be, only that it will be on Cherry Tree Lane, which will be added to the United Kingdom pavilion. Guests will enter the attraction we don t know if it will be a ride or something else through the Banks family home at No. 17. Although the original Mary Poppins movie premiered 55 years ago, this will be the first Mary Poppins inspired attraction at any Disney Park. There hasn t been a hint of an opening date, but since it involves construction of a new building or buildings, it s likely to take at least two years.

'Disney's best kept secret': Disney prop and antique business thrives in Polk County LAKELAND If there's one thing Eric Zinkann knows, it's how to turn a hobby into a serious profit. Zinkann,49, has been in the collectibles business since he was in the eighth grade. He mostly collected comic books, eventually starting to sell them through eBay and his website, Vault Collectibles. And he doesn't exactly deal in pocket change: He once sold a Batman comic for nearly 100,0, bringing home an 80,000 profit. About five years ago he expanded his range, collecting props and merchandise from the major Orlando theme parks. He sells those items at his booth in Lakeland Antique Mall, one that has been featured on social media sites like Instagram," Tik Tok and YouTube. """"I'm not gonna be a millionaire overnight. But it's fun", and I think that's what I'm looking to do eventually, is retire and do this and enjoy myself," Zinkann said. """"Some people call it 401K. It'll be 401D"," for Disney. """" Just outside of Walt Disney World", Polk County sellers like Zinkann deal in an odd, if thriving, business: the sale of authentic Disney furniture and merchandise from the theme parks and resorts. The items, bought and sold by longtime Disney fanatics," come directly from Disney. Vendors say the industry isn't too large but it's profitable. Buyers have been known to schedule their Disney vacation around a trip to a local seller or travel from several states away to get their hands on a lamp once used at their favorite Disney hotel. """"People love just getting something from Disney that was used at the parks or the resort", Zinkann said. Customers looking for furniture and other collectible pieces sold directly from Disney can find them in two main places: Forever Vintage and Surplus in Winter Haven and the Lakeland Antique Mall in North Lakeland. More:Disney World lays off 720 performers because of COVID 19 pandemic Related:Disney guest accused of hitting, threatening guard over COVID 19 mask rule at Orlando park Buying directly from Disney is an exclusive process shrouded in mystery, but it can churn enough profit to be a full time career, sellers say. The merchandise, usually offered when a major Disney hotel undergoes renovation," has been featured in videos on sites like YouTube that have doubled the followings for Polk County vendors. The adjacent Disney antique industry also thrives. """"It's Disney's best kept secret", Zinkann said. Disney's inner circle Those looking for used Disney furniture know of Winter Haven's most famous one stop shop: Forever Vintage, run by Mary Jo and Stacey Reddick. The couple opened the store three and a half years ago, intending to sell vintage items and the occasional Disney surprise. Flash forward to 2020: Stacey Reddick has to travel to Orlando about four times a week to pick up Disney items. Forever Vintage, open from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m. on Saturdays, only holds about a third of the stock the Reddicks have on hand. The store has attracted quite a following, nearly 20,000 likes on Facebook. And at store opening each week, the line can stretch 50 people deep. On Dec. 12, the couple had already stopped taking shipping orders for Christmas to ensure they had the time and manpower to send out existing purchases. The couple have also opened a booth in Bless This Mess, a store in Dundee owned by Mary Jo Reddick's sister. There, customers can buy merchandise during the week. The Reddicks are also looking for a larger space for Forever Vintage. Stacey Reddick,50," says customers often just want to take a piece of their favorite Disney resorts home with them. """"The tiki lamps", the special pillows, the bed runners these are all items that everybody wants," he said. """"They see them in their hotel room when they stay there and they love them and they want to take them home. So"," these are the items we try to keep getting for them. """" Reddick declined to provide any specific numbers but said the business is profitable. """"Some items we don't make much money on at all", but we're going to sell those items to bring people into the store at that price, Reddick said. Reddick also wouldn't say how he became a Disney buyer, a position not open to just anybody. Zinkann with Vault Collectibles, who also sells props from Universal Studios, said it took him two years to break into the industry. His lips are sealed," too. """"I feel like it took so long to get in there", I don't want other people to know, Zinkann said," laughing. """"I know that sounds horrible but it's hard to get this stuff. Even when they decide to sell"," it's very difficult. """" The Walt Disney Company did not return a request for comment for this story. How do sellers secure merchandise once they're in with Disney? Reddick and Zinkann said depending on the item", it can either be sold at auction or at a fixed price. The kind of items available are often dependent on which Disney resort is undergoing renovation at any given time, as old furniture and decorations are then sold off. Sometimes, when Reddick knows a certain hotel is up, he'll ask Disney about specific items and offer a buying price, which Disney can reject. But not everything is for sale. Reddick said items are often donated, and Zinkann said cast members can get first priority. Items from inside the theme parks outside of holiday decorations and popcorn buckets are even harder to come by as Disney often doesn't sell those pieces. Customers from far and wide Reddick said most of his items range from 50 to 300. Customers, some of whom are looking to re create specific rooms in their homes, are more than willing to shell out the dough and sometimes," even a little bit extra for gas. """"It's funny", because some people will actually tell us they schedule their WDW vacation around making it here on a Saturday, Reddick said. But the roughly 30 mile stretch between the Magic Kingdom and Forever Vintage pales in comparison to some of Reddick's frequent fliers, like one man who drives straight to the store and back from Georgia about twice a month. Reddick also had customers from Pennsylvania and a couple from Tennessee who wanted Disney furniture for the remodel of their house. Customers from out of state may have seen Forever Vintage and the Lakeland Antique Mall in videos on Instagram or Tik Tok. But Reddick and Zinkann credit one YouTube user, Paging Mr. Morrow," for driving a ton of traffic to their respective locations after he posted videos on both in September and October. Reddick said the video doubled their likes on Facebook. """"Because of Paging Mr. Morrow", Zinkann said," """"we've had people from New York", Tennessee, New Jersey, a lot of states, mostly northern states, who said they saw the video and while they were going to Disney," they had to stop by. So it's been really cool. """" Jim Morgante",40, said he learned about both major Polk Disney sellers through Tik Tok videos. Although he was on vacation at Walt Disney World," Morgante decided to spend his early Saturday afternoon at Forever Vintage. He bought records there and a lamp from the Saratoga Springs resort at Lakeland Antique Mall. """"We've been enjoying the parks for years", and we didn't know that things were available locally until we'd seen advertisements on social media," Morgante said. Reddick and Zinkann said items from Disney's Polynesian Village Resort and deck chairs and blankets from Disney's cruise line have been bestsellers from the past few years. Reddick added anything with a famous """"hidden Mickey"""" will do especially well"," as long as it's authentic. """"Things that were actually in Disney and hung sell better"," Reddick said. """"A used item from a hotel sells better than a brand new item. """" All the small things You don't have to be one of Disney's direct buyers to profit from Mickey Mouse fever. Donna Guinn",77, has been selling antiques for 48 years," and Disney is her best seller. """"Just about everybody loves Disney"," Guinn said. """"I didn't drink", smoke," or do drugs. Disney was where my extra money went. """" Guinn", who has 10 booths at the Lakeland Antique Mall," said she'll sell just about """"anything that's collectible. """" But she has three booths and two glass display cases dedicated almost entirely to Disney stock. Her model is more traditional: She buys her items from flea markets", yard sales and the occasional Disney cast member looking to sell off a collection. Guinn said she was the top seller at the mall for some time, but has since been overtaken, mostly because she can't mark and put out items as fast as she used to be able to. However, one thing does consistently well: collectible Disney pins, Guinn's top seller. Even if Guinn wanted to," the exclusive nature of buying directly from Disney prevents most from buying props and other resort items. Zinkann said cast members will sometimes see stuff at places like the antique mall and ask Disney if certain vendors are authorized sellers. """"Disney keeps a sharp eye on items out there. If it comes up Disney", somebody on eBay, they know what's on eBay. They know what's out there," Reddick said. """"You want to do everything right. Cause they're a great company to work with. """" But it isn't just the fear of getting on Disney's bad side that keeps sellers in line. """"It's just my integrity. I know that I buy", everything I get is directly from Disney," Zinkann said. """"So I try not to buy second hand stuff myself. Because then it", to me," it calls into question authenticity. """" For Guinn", a lifelong Lakeland resident and fourth generation Floridian, the love of Disney runs deep. She lost track of her Disney trips once she'd been there over 80 times, which happened three decades ago. That's a trend with Disney sellers. The Reddicks are passholders who have been on 18 Disney cruises. All Zinkann wanted to do when his daughter turned four was take her on the Haunted Mansion at the Magic Kingdom park. Both sellers have kept several of their purchased Disney items for their own homes. Theme park obsession comes in handy. Disney will sell some items without indicating where they came from," forcing Disney fans to use their institutional knowledge to correctly place items in their respective parks or resorts. It's an effort that pays off. """"Most people have a good time and they're really happy when they're at Disney"," Reddick said. """"They stayed in that room and to have something from that time when they were there having all that fun and enjoying themselves is a nice memory.

Best Time to Visit Disney World? Disney's theme park ticket prices vary by day, so you can use Disney's pricing calendar scroll down to see which days have the highest expected crowds. The lower the price for a ticket, the smaller the expected crowd that day. In general, you will find the lightest crowd levels at the Walt Disney World theme parks during these periods: Late January (after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday week) through mid February Early to mid March Late April through mid May Mid to late August (Note that this is prime hurricane season in Florida, however. ) Weekdays in November through mid December, except for Thanksgiving week, which is one of the busiest of the year. Large crowds will fill the parks on runDisney weekends: February 24 27, 2022 March 31 April 3, 2022 November 3 6, 2022 January 4 8, 2023 February 23 26, 2023 April 13 16, 2023 In addition, crowd levels are high during: Any holiday week Spring break, from mid March through mid April Summer vacation, from Memorial Day through early August Halloween and festival season in September and October Thanksgiving week The two to three weeks from Christmas through New Year's Whenever you plan to visit," you must make date specific reservations in advance to use your tickets. You can see which dates are open to reserve on Disney's """"Park Pass"""" availability calendar. See the next section", below," for more advice on planning your Walt Disney World visit. Strategy The Walt Disney World Resort now requires that all guests make date specific reservations in advance to visit its theme parks. You can see which dates are available to reserve on Disney's """"Park Pass"""" availability calendar. Dates are listed up to about 15 months in advance", and reservations are available on a first come, first served basis. However, Disney maintains separate pools of available reservations each day for its annual passholders and its on site hotel guests," as well as for regular ticket holders. So if a specific date is """"sold out"""" for annual passholders", it might still be available for regular ticket holders. If you want to visit more than one Walt Disney World theme park on a single day," you will need a """"Park Hopper"""" ticket. You will make a reservation for the park you visit first on each date", then you can park hop to other parks starting at 2pm that day. Once you have selected the dates you wish to visit and made your Disney Park Pass reservations, you may want to make dining reservations in advance of your visit, as well. Reservations can be made via the Disney World website, and each date's reservations open 60 days in advance, at about 5:45am Eastern Time. Disney's on site hotel guests may make reservations for their entire stay (up to 10 days) starting 60 days before their check in date. That gives Disney's on site hotel guests an advantage in making reservations for the most popular restaurants. Disney's hotel guests also get 30 minutes of early access to each of the resort's four theme parks every day. So hotel guests should plan on an early start each morning to take advantage of empty queues. Unfortunately for guests staying off site, this new early admission policy means that they no longer have any opportunity to be the first to enter any Walt Disney World theme park in the morning. As for planning your day, Walt Disney World now offers a new tool on its official My Disney Experience app to create a custom itinerary for each day of your visit. In addition, Disney offers two ways for its theme park guests to pay to access shorter wait times for many popular attractions. You can learn more about these options in our posts: How to Use Disney Genie at Walt Disney World (free and useful trip planning tools, plus the automated itineraries) How to Use Disney Genie Plus (one time daily payment to skip many lines) How to Use Disney's Individual Lightning Lane (pay per use line skips for the most popular attractions) The longest wait here throughout the day tends to be Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, so even with Disney's hotel guests getting a head start, it's still a good candidate to make your first ride when the park opens. Just try to avoid riding Splash Mountain in the heat of the afternoon, when its wait time spikes. Read our guide to Disney Genie for more advice on how to use Disney's app to avoid long wait times in the park. Walt Disney World News How Disney Cast and Community gave back in 2020 Please note: some posts may contain affiliate links which means our team could earn money if you purchase products from our site It s no secret that 2020 was a rough year for a lot of people. Disney is pretty well known for giving back to communities and those in need. The Disney cast and community did just that and offer support to communities around the world last year. Let s take a look at some of the ways Disney gave back in 2020: Around the world, Disney shared over 880 tons of food to support those in need. From more than 145,000 pizza meals donated from Disneyland Paris, to pineapple, sweet rolls and more from Aulani Resort, contributing to local communities continues to be a commitment of Disney s, including Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort. During the pandemic, Disney found ways to help local healthcare heroes. Earlier this year, Disney introduced non medical, reusable cloth face coverings featuring fan favorite characters in the U. S. As part of the launch, one million face coverings were donated to MedShare, and profits from the sales of the cloth masks raised an additional 1 million for MedShare to support the medical community s ongoing efforts to provide lifesaving care to those in need. After receiving a suggestion from nurses at hospitals, Disney Parks donated over 250,000 rain ponchos globally to help healthcare heroes protect their clothing and prolong the use of PPE during busy times, as well as N95 masks, hygiene caps and more supplies for hospitals. Related Disney donates coins from Wishing Wells to local charity Celebrating the holidays may have looked a little different this year, but making them special for those in need brought joy and inspiration to our communities. This year, shopDisney. com, Disney stores across the U. S. and World of Disney stores at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort collected 90,000 toys for Toys for Tots to help bring joy to children in need this holiday season. Meanwhile, at Walt Disney World Resort, chefs dished up hundreds of tasty Thanksgiving meals to support the Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida. This holiday season, Disney Cruise Line teamed up with local community partners in The Bahamas to provide thousands of holiday dinners to families in need. And at Disneyland Paris, cast prepared 50,000 Christmas ornaments to brighten up 150 French and Belgian hospitals this winter. Related Disney World Chefs donate meals to 650 people for Thanksgiving Watch our latest Disney News in Review Disney also worked to spread joy by delighting fans and families wherever they may be. To ignite curiosity and inspire creativity at home, Walt Disney Imagineering rolled out Imagineering in a Box in five languages, along with Ride Learn videos and Disney Paper Parks. For those who dreamed of a brighter tomorrow, Disneyland Resort VoluntEARS provided more than 50 virtual workforce development sessions to hundreds of Anaheim students to help them learn how to build a professional resume. Disney Cruise Line awarded scholarships to four female cadets to attend the maritime academy in Nassau. The scholarships, one for each of the ships in the Disney Cruise Line fleet, include two years of study at LJM Maritime Academy and one year of service aboard a Disney ship. This scholarship program is part of a larger collection of initiatives Disney Cruise Line has implemented to inspire future maritime professionals and support communities across The Bahamas. At Walt Disney World Resort, Disney collaborated with A Gift For Teaching to donate thousands of needed school supplies for teachers, and Disneyland Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort each shared more than 13,000 toys and activity items with local hospitals. To celebrate International Children s Day in June, Shanghai Disney Resort opened a space themed Disney Fun House at Shanghai Children s Medical Center, bringing happiness and unique Disney experiences to children and families. Disney is also working with Boys Girls Clubs of America to share one million books with kids across the country, and will continue to deliver more through the holidays and into the new year! As Disney celebrates the 40th anniversary of working together with Make A Wish , they ve granted some unforgettable wishes. Recently, six year old Maria had her wish to be a princess granted, enjoying a virtual royal visit all in Spanish from Princess Belle. And earlier this year Disney celebrated a very special Super Bowl victory, as 10 year old wish kid Nathaniel became the first wish kid to join a Super Bowl MVP parade down Main Street, U. S. A. in Magic Kingdom Park! And with your help, Disney has unlocked over 720,000 to further wish granting, with the release of the Wishes Come True Blue color collection, Mickey Mouse vintage holiday plush and Disney Parks Wishables. Related Make a wish grants a Magical Disney Wish for a thoughtful little camper In 2020, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products donated more than 30 million in food, products, and supplies as part of Disney s overall COVID response efforts. From food and supply donations to activities and performances to enjoy from home, Disney has been able to share the joy of Disney with fans and families not to mention virtual volunteer opportunities for cast members and continuing to find innovative ways to grant wishes and make magical moments possible with nonprofit partners like Make A Wish.

Obviously, last year wasn't the year that any of us wanted or expected, but even though there's hope on the horizon, 2021 doesn't look like it's going to be a return to normal. Here's what to expect while visiting Walt Disney World this year, along with some other theme park news of the week. MAJOR CHANGES TO YOUR FUTURE VACATIONS If you ve been tapped out when it comes to theme park news, there are two changes effective this year you need to know about. First off, those complimentary Magic Bands you d get in the mail weeks before your vacation with a Disney hotel booking? No more. You can still purchase the wristbands, which are used around the resort for ease while opening a hotel room door, scanning theme park admission, or charging items to one's room, for the discounted price of 5 with a hotel reservation or 15 plus as a day guest. The move comes as Walt Disney World further rolls out expanded functionality within its My Disney Experience mobile app. The other noteworthy change is that park hopping has officially returned to Walt Disney World but not in the way you may be used to. Since reopening late last year, all park guests must have a Park Pass reservation and valid admission to enter a Walt Disney World theme park. Previously, guests were only allowed to stay in that singular park say, Magic Kingdom but as of Jan. 1, Disney goers may freely move between all four theme parks starting at 2 pm daily. (Specific details in regards to ticketing options are available here. ) Parks can reach capacity, so it s recommended to check the Disney World calendar to confirm park hopping hours, as well as to call the hotline (407) 560 5000 to confirm a park isn t closed for capacity. Be sure to plan ahead if you're going to Epcot, too, as its monorail is still not in use. Credit: Matt Stroshane/Walt Disney World Resort via Getty Images A HOLIDAY SEASON UPDATE It s tricky to discuss the past couple of weeks at Florida's theme parks without being there personally (hello from California!) but by all accounts, the parks were bustling over the holiday break. Disney Springs, the downtown district at Walt Disney World, reportedly reached capacity over the weekend, while Universal s theme parks hit capacity on multiple occasions. (Universal Orlando does not require an advanced reservation system Disney World, which does, similarly sold out of certain park availability for multiple days over the holiday stretch. ) Capacity, of course, is reduced from normal times to allow for COVID 19 safety protocols, but there is no official figure on what theme park capacity currently is. The last reported admission ceiling was 35 percent for Walt Disney World back in November. At the same time, news stories over the holidays showed theme parks had seemingly re evaluated their COVID 19 era protocols for ride boarding. Riders are now being seated directly next to each other on certain attractions and less distance is being provided between them than before on other attractions. Still, it s unclear if these changes reflect more guests being in the parks or just updated processes to shorten wait times and cycle visitors through rides more efficiently. Some attractions, including Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run, have added plexiglass barriers between riders to increase on ride capacity it's a small world tested the barriers early this week as well. Still, Disney Food Blog reported earlier this week that Epcot is indeed surveying guests about crowding and congestion in addition to general questions about their day at the theme park. It's worth mentioning the holiday season wasn t just busier in Orlando a record number of pandemic era flights went out the weekend before Christmas, broken only by the number this past Sunday following New Year s weekend. A spokeswoman for the TSA mentioned a bump is typical for this time of year, but nonetheless jarring when so many are being urged both by loved ones as well as state and local governments to stay home. As for Florida, The Orlando Sentinel reported that AdventHealth, a local health care network, had measured a significant jump in COVID 19 related hospitalizations over the past weekend. The paper also cites that Florida has reported over 10,000 new cases of COVID 19 every single day for the past week. WHAT'S COMING NEXT IN 2021 With Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration officially coming later this year, we're finally getting a solid look at what's on deck for the festivities in 2021. Remy s Ratatouille Adventure at Epcot and Avengers Campus at Disneyland are a lock no surprise there, really but rumors about delays at TRON Lightcycle Run and Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind were somewhat confirmed when both were not included on Disney D23's post about what to look forward to in 2021. Neither of those projects as well as Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, previously confirmed for 2021 yet left off the lineup are guaranteed to be pushed to 2022 and beyond, but as the pandemic rages on, delays make more and more sense. Either way, we will be sure to keep you posted all year long. TWEET OF THE WEEK Surprise! It's me!

Travel to Disney Parks during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go  David Roark/Walt Disney World Resort via Getty Images Walt Disney World reopened in July 2020. If you're planning to travel to one of the Disney Parks Resorts around the world, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid 19 pandemic. The basics All Disney parks around the world except one are now open to visitors, though Covid 19 restrictions remain in place. Disneyland Resort in California reopened on April 30, 2021 with limited capacity at Disneyland park and Disney California Adventure park. Those wanting to visit need to purchase tickets in advance via a new online reservation system. All three of the California Disney resort's hotels are open. In Florida, all of Disney World's parks are open. Disney World also requires visitors to make reservations in advance. As for the Florida park's hotels, most have already reopened. Hong Kong Disneyland has been closed since January 7 and will reopen on February 18. On its website," the park pointed to the latest global surge of Covid 19 saying the move was """"required by the government and health authorities and in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong. """" The move affects the theme park itself", but not its resort hotels. Shanghai Disneyland Park including is hotels are operating with enhanced health and safety measures in place. Guests need to reserve their tickets online before visiting. Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea are open, along with their hotels. A new addition, the Toy Story Hotel, is due to open in April 2022. Disneyland Paris fully reopened on June 17, while its new Disney's Hotel New York: The Art of Marvel property opened on June 21. All other Disney hotels there are open with the exception of the Disneyland Hotel, which is currently closed for renovations. What's on offer The original and, some might say, best, theme parks, Disney's resorts remain a magical experience for all the family. From vertiginous rides to firework displays, and of course the chance to meet classic characters, a trip to a Disney Park makes memories that last a lifetime. Who can go Entry to each Disney Park is dependent on local travel restrictions. The Paris location is subject to France's entry rules. In line with the latest French authorities' requirements, a Health Pass is required for guests aged 12 and older to visit the Disney parks in Paris. Only locals and returning citizens can access Hong Kong Disney park while the Shanghai resort can only be accessed by locals or those who meet China's strict entry requirements, including two negative test results taken within 48 hours of departures. Japan also remains closed to tourists, meaning only residents are able to visit the Tokyo Disney parks. What are the restrictions? In the US, all guests ages 2 and up at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort are required to wear face coverings indoors," regardless of vaccination status. They are optional for outdoor common areas. Disneyland has eliminated on site temperature checks and is allowing guests to """"self determine"""" social distancing since California has removed distancing requirements. Some parks have reduced capacity and require temperature checks on entry. Guests of Tokyo", Hong Kong and Shanghai parks need to continue to wear masks in all areas. In the Paris Disney parks, face coverings are mandatory in all areas for guests aged 11 and over. What's the Covid situation? Exact numbers of cases linked to Disney Parks are unclear. What can visitors expect? Some Disney parks have resumed their nightly fireworks shows and parades. Schedules and reopening information are available on each individual park's website. Capacity has been cut in Disney's theme parks, with numbers further limited in restaurants and in queues to prevent overcrowding. Despite this, guests can still dine in at their favorite restaurants and enjoy the rides, though some character meet and greets have been replaced by socially distanced character processions. Several Disney World restaurants in hotels and theme parks are allowing character dining again. Reservations, highly recommended, are required in some locations. At Disneyland in California, Minnie and Friends Breakfast at Plaza Inn reopened for character dining in August 2021. In the hotels, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel Spa offers the Mickey's Tales of Adventure Breakfast at Storytellers Caf and the Disney Princess Breakfast Adventures inside the Napa Rose restaurant," while the Disneyland Hotel has Goofy's Kitchen. Disney World's 50th anniversary party kicked off on October 1 and will last 18 months. Celebrations will be held in all four of the resort's theme parks.

Don't miss a thing! Sign up to the Daily Star's newsletter The theme parks at Disney are celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2021 and new rides and attractions are opening in its honour. Disney World, alongside Disneyland California and Paris all have new openings planned. The event is celebrating the opening of Disney World which opened in Orlando in 1971. Originally, there was just the Magic Kingdom, but this was followed by Disneyland Paris in 1992 and California in 2001. While many of the parks have closed over the last year, and construction halted, due to the pandemic there are still plans afoot. Here s what will be opening at the various Disney parks this year: Which new attraction are you most excited about? Tell us in the comments. (Image: Disney) Disneyland Paris Opening in Paris is the first Marvel hotel a four star accommodation featuring original Marvel artwork. There will also been meet and greets with all our favourite Marvel characters and free shuttles to the park. Plus, there s a new Cars themed ride and characters.

Plus, Doctor Strange Sanctum will help you to learn your magic powers. And, the Pym Test Kitchen will feature bizarre meals and snacks for all. It s all very exciting here s hoping we re able to travel in time to enjoy the festivities! Dear Disney, Close The Hall of Presidents Dear Disney, Close The Hall of Presidents Dear Bob Chapek and Josh D'Amaro, Given what has happened in Washington, D. C. today, it is time to close The Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. The United States Capitol fell today to insurgents incited by defeated President Donald Trump. Trump's Department of Defense initially declined to allow the National Guard to defend the Capitol after a request from the overwhelmed D. C. police. As a result, the insurgents prevented the scheduled certification of President elect Joe Biden, in a planned interruption of a Constitutionally mandated function of the federal government. Make no mistake. This is an act of sedition of treason against the United States government. It is a dark day for America, and The Walt Disney Company should not celebrate it by continuing to give Donald Trump a voice in one of its attractions. Close The Hall of Presidents. This attraction was intended as a patriotic tribute to the nation that cultivate Walter Elias Disney's dreams. It was a logical extension of the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln attraction that Disney brought to the 1964 World's Fair for the State of Illinois, then later installed at Disneyland in California, where a version plays to this day. For years, Walt Disney World visitors enjoyed this inspiring presentation and walked away with renewed confidence in the enduring office of the Presidency. But a misguided decision to allow the incumbent President a speech in the show tinged the show with contemporary partisanship. What was intended as a patriotic tribute now felt divisive to some Disney guests. I suggested last July that Disney should consider changing or removing The Hall of Presidents. What Trump has done now should leave Disney no choice. Unless the company wishes to insult patriotic Americans who cannot stand the sight of its Capitol being overrun by racist thugs, some flying Confederate battle flags, it must silence its Trump Audio Animatronic and forever banish it from public display. If Disney wishes to leave the Hall closed until that day when Trump is (I hope) convicted of treason and to use that conviction as an excuse for Trump's exclusion from a future roll call of Presidents, so be it. If Disney wishes to rewrite the show and reduce the number of Presidents depicted to cover Trump's absence, fine. If Disney wishes to reduce the show to an east coast installation Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln and put all the other presidents into storage, okay. If Disney wants to remove the production entirely and repurpose the theater for Great Moments in American History Featuring The Muppets or a restaged production of Lin Manuel Miranda's Hamilton, that would be fine by me. Bob and Josh, Disney did the right thing by removing Confederate flags from The American Adventure in Epcot. Disney has enjoyed a long history of supporting and celebrating America. It should not for one more moment continue to celebrate someone who has shown that he is willing to abuse the office of the Presidency to defile the Constitution, the Capitol, and the will of the American people. Close The Hall of Presidents.  Disney World celebrates 50 years - six things fans can expect from the parks in 2021 Back in 2017 practically ancient history by today's standards Disney announced big plans for 2021," the 50th anniversary of the opening of Walt Disney World in Florida. """"For a milestone that big"," it's never too early to start planning. especially when you're planning something huge!"""" the announcement said", highlighting new roller coasters at the Epcot and Magic Kingdom theme parks. Not even the coronavirus can delay an anniversary, but those big plans have shrunk as the pandemic forced the company to reduce crowd sizes, add new safety measures, pause construction and in the case of Disneyland in California remain mostly closed indefinitely. Jessica Sanders, who runs the Disneyland planning site the Happiest Blog on Earth, said she wouldn't make plans to visit the California parks before the summer," """"unless you're willing to change those plans. """" And even once those parks open", she said, the experience will be vastly different than before, with limited crowds, safety measures like masks and social distancing," and scaled back offerings. """"For someone that's looking for a full theme park experience", it's going to be past 2021, she said. There's still much uncertainty about when the California parks will open and when new rides will debut this year, but here's what the company has said will be new (or returning after going away) this year: 1. That 50th anniversary Despite all the changes, Disney will mark the 50th anniversary of the Florida resort on October 1. Typically, the company stretches anniversary celebrations out over long stretches of time, though no plans have been announced yet. Jana Hornsby, general manager of South Carolina based Discover the Magic Vacations," said clients are still eager to be there for the milestone date. """"When we're making new reservations now", we really have to be careful with availability," she said. """"Because once that ability to make reservations for that time period opened up"," we had Disney fanatics flocking to be there. """" As for those big 2021 plans that were announced in 2017? That timing appears to be up in the air. They include Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind", a roller coaster at Epcot a Tron roller coaster at the Magic Kingdom and Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser," an immersive two night experience aboard a """"starship"""" hotel. 2.

Kelly who is famously known for designing the Playboy Mansion. The home is 3 stories high and was previously listed for sale at 3.6 million in 2016. In 2019, Bell and Shepard teamed up with La Z Boy for a new product launch, so their home now features more than one recliner. She told Architectural Digest that she would have let her kids design her own room, but it s not as easy as it sounds. I was looking through pictures, and they were trying to explain what they wanted, she said. And I roughly got a sketch in crayon of, like, a slide and a ball pit.

The Oscar nominations are out, and this year's nine Best Picture nominees include three heavily Los Angeles based stories. L. A. and Hollywood often show up on screen, but with filmmakers often making efforts to not just tell Los Angeles stories, it's notable to see more of those being told at the Academy nominee level this year. Here are some of the on screen L. A. specifics you'll find in three of this year's most critically acclaimed films. FORD V FERRARI Matt Damon and Christian Bale in Ford v Ferrari. (Merrick Morton) Ford v Ferrari has a globe spanning story of the battle between Ford and Ferrari, with races around the world, but its real life main characters were based in Los Angeles. Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon, was a Le Mans champion who went on to design cars and sell them here in L. A. His Shelby American would build high performance parts and sell modified cars, based out of Venice during the time of the film. Test driver Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale, worked with Shelby testing prototypes at LAX. One of the other iconic locations you'll spot in the film comes in the movie's post Le Mans coda, as Miles crashes while testing a car at the Riverside International Raceway. And while the movie heads to international competitions, culminating in France's famed Le Mans 24 hour competition, there's another reason the movie may feel local those locations were all recreated and shot here in Southern California. That includes everything from a downtown L. A. steel factory doubling for a Ford plant to Santa Clarita's Agua Dulce Airpark being used to stage the Le Mans race. You can see Ford v Ferrari cars at the Petersen Automotive Museum through this weekend. They're also hosting a Ford v Ferrari themed panel during the Petersen's All American Car Cruise in on Jan. 26, featuring the author of the book that inspired the movie, Ken Miles' son, and Carroll Shelby's grandson. ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD Pussycat Theatre A recreation on the Hollywood Boulevard set of Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. (Else Duff) The most obviously L. A. movie of the bunch (the title's a clue), director Quentin Tarantino set about recreating 1960s Hollywood to give his movie the period authenticity that he wanted. The movie follows an actor and his stuntman, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, loosely inspired by the relationship by Burt Reynolds and his own stuntman. It also follows Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate, playing with the reality around her own fate at the hands of the Manson Family. So that the film's protagonists could cruise Hollywood Boulevard, the filmmakers brought back the rainbow exterior of 1969's Aquarius Theater, turned the ArcLight's Cinerama dome back to its vintage appearance, and more. They even brought back some of the seedier side of Hollywood the Hologram USA Theater turned back into the Pussycat Theater, which showed adult films at the time. They also had to completely shut down Hollywood Boulevard to capture some of the film's iconic shots made possible with the help of Tarantino making the pitch to local stakeholders. Other changes included the restaurant interiors, which served as virtual time machines. Musso Frank's was repainted to get it just right, and El Coyote got a touchup. El Coyote's a key part of the movie's real world history, as it's where Sharon Tate had her last meal. The movie's SoCal locales also include Hollywood studios, the Playboy Mansion, the Manson Family's Spahn Ranch, and the Hollywood Hills homes where the movie's big finale takes place. MARRIAGE STORY A still from Marriage Story. (Wilson Webb) Marriage Story is the one film here set in the modern day. It follows Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as they go through a divorce, starting in New York before Nicole decides to move out West. Rather than big iconic locations, this movie's L. A. scenes are set more around suburban homes. Nicole moves out to L. A. from New York after being offered a role in a TV pilot, living with her mother in West Hollywood and bringing the couple's son with her. Charlie ventures out to L. A. to be closer to their son and make the case for custody, initially visiting before renting an apartment. The film's conflict is driven by the lawyers each character hires in Los Angeles. It's an intimate story, with L. A. life playing an increasingly large role as the film progresses. Keep an eye out for the very L. A. take on Halloween, and finding where exactly to take L. A. kids trick or treating. Ford v Ferrari is in theaters now. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is available on home video. Marriage Story is available on Netflix.  'Once a Playmate, Always a Playmate,' 40 years after my centerfold, I posed for another Playboy feature It was always Hugh Hefner s (Hef s) mantra, Once a Playmate, always a Playmate, and I felt the full force of this after I was asked to fly to L. A. for another shoot for Playboy magazine a full 40 years after appearing as its December 1979 centerfold. The request, obviously, caught me completely off guard since I didn t expect to be modeling for Playboy after all these years. My journey with the organization began way back in 1974 when I first became a Bunny at the St. Louis Playboy Club. My first photo shoot, shortly after being hired, was for a Best Bunnies pictorial. It caught the attention of the home office in Chicago and I was quickly invited to transfer to the hub, which I did, moving into the storied Playboy Mansion on State Street on September 22, 1974. Two years ago, Cooper Hefner invited me to reprise my February 1979 cover for another feature for the magazine that included six other iconic Playmates his mother, Kimberly Conrad Hefner (Playmate of the Year 1989, Jan. 1988 Playmate) Rene Tenison (PMOY 1990, Nov. 1989 PM) Lisa Matthews (PMOY 1991, April 1990 PM) Charlotte Kemp Muhl (December 1982 PM) Cathy St. George (August 1982 PM) and Monique St. Pierre (PMOY 1979, November 1978 PM). This most recent shoot was a complete departure of anything I ve ever done for Playboy before. It included Renee Tenison (the first African American PMOY, 1990, November 1989 PM who also appeared in the cover reprisal shoot Victoria Valentino (September 1963 Playmate who was a Cosby victim and now the oldest PM to ever appear in the magazine at age 77) Raquel Pomplun (the first Mexican/ American PMOY, 2013, and the April 2012 Playmate) and Brande Roderick (PMOY 2001 and April 2000 PM). The issue celebrates five decades of Playmates, a first for the magazine! I was invited to participate via an email that arrived on October 9, just after Chuck and I had returned from a trip to Dollywood where I had eaten my way through every fried food stand there. Waist wise, the timing couldn t have been worse but I shaped up in time and was fully prepared by the time I arrived in LA on October 21. The 12 page cover feature was shot by Nadia Lee Cohen, a cool, edgy female photographer who also serves as her own muse on her Instagram account. She s a contributing photog for Vogue mag too. Her surreal vision for the shoot came as a surprise to me and several others. It involved a step back in time, the swingin 60s, when wigs were big (literally and figuratively). Nadia s crack styling team was on top of it all. (Luckily though, I convinced Nadia to let me ditch the wig, which she kindly did. ) Looooonnngggg fake nails were glued onto everyone s hands and looooonnngggg eyelashes were applied. Heavy eye makeup was the order of the day as were the aforementioned wigs. Downstairs, racks and racks of vintage clothing, underwear, heels, jewelry and more were strewn across every spare surface. We were instructed to get spray tans before we came. Nadia mentioned during the shoot that she was aiming for something like a Valley of the Dolls vibe which involved pretty serious wigs. I wasn t overly pleased to hear this but, in the end, her vision just rocked and made history for Playboy. The venue was a house in Burbank that was once owned by Esther Williams, the iconic swim star from the 40s/ 50s. It s vintage vibe had never been touched as witnessed by the throwback wooden features and overall mustiness. An orange shag carpet had been brought in to add more authenticity to the era. There was a pool in back, of course, and a guest house that served as the staging area for wardrobe, hair and makeup. It was a BIG shoot, lots and lots of crew and even a dog wrangler for two cute pups who seemed to want to be anywhere else but where they were. I just loved reconnecting with the Playmates and was happy to meet the new guard at Playboy magazine. They were enthusiastic and very respectful of the past yet with a firm eye on the future. I was so honored to be one of the Playmates chosen for this cover feature representing five decades of Playmates. As photographer Nadia Lee Cohen explained, I wanted to celebrate the original Playmates who helped shape and pioneer the brand. Just as Hefner always wanted when he coined the phrase and title of the feature Once a Playmate, Always a Playmate.

Spring Branch ISD ( SBISD) January 24, 2020 HOUSTON, Texas At least two people are dead after a massive explosion rocked a northwest Houston neighborhood Friday morning, breaking windows, collapsing ceilings and even knocking houses off their foundations up to two miles away. Officials have identified Gerardo Castorena Sr. and Frank Flores as two victims who were killed in fatal explosions. The explosion happened around 4:25 a. m. in the 4500 block of Gessner Road. The origin of the explosion was at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing , a machining and manufacturing company, according to its website Houston police say the two victims are likely employees at Watson Grinding. Chief Art Acevedo informed the public that the son of Castorena was in the U. S. Marines and sent a plea to community members advising them to reach out to the Marines in order for him to come home immediately. Over twenty four hours later, the Marines agreed to let the solider travel home to be with his family, according to the military group 'Boots for Troops'. A man who spoke to ABC13 said his 6 year old niece was taken to Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital to be checked out. He said her family's house is close to the business that exploded and that his brother told him something fell on the little girl's head. The family is waiting to get more information about her condition. Fire officials say at least 18 people have visited local emergency rooms, complaining of minor injuries and breathing issues. Witnesses told ABC13 they saw two injured people walk out of the debris field moments after the blast. The largest debris field and damage is in the area between Gessner and Steffani Lane in the Westbranch neighborhood. As of Friday afternoon, police closed off two nearby neighborhoods Westbranch and Carverdale that were impacted by the blast. Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena said 180 to 190 homes have some damage. Officials aren't 100 percent sure of the identity of the victims, but they say there is a high probability they are workers because they're the only two people missing and their vehicles were at the location. Acevedo said families of the two victims have been contacted and he asked that people pray for the families. Chief Acevedo said residents would be the only people allowed to go back to those neighborhoods. Earlier, he said patrols will be watching the neighborhoods where people left their homes. He warned looters will be charged. ""You will not be given a slap on the wrist. I want you to think back to Hurricane Harvey when we caught someone looting and they were sentenced to 20 years in prison,"" Acevedo said. Entire structures were destroyed in the blast. Homes were blown off their foundations in the adjoining neighborhood, authorities said. Broken windows, doors, and garage doors were also reported across a wide area around the blast site. As a result of the blast, at least 48 people were directed to a temporary shelter at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints on Shadowdale Drive, according to the Houston Fire Department. An overnight shelter was later set up at the Fairbanks United Methodist Church at 14210 Aston St. The ATF was responding to the site, although the Houston Fire Department will remain the lead agency, according to ATF spokesperson Nicole Strong. The agency later added that its five National Response Teams were sent to Houston, consisting of 30 members who include arson investigators, bomb technicians, scientists, and engineers. Dogs have been brought in to assist with searching the area. Firefighters were walking door to door in a neighborhood next to the blast site. Crews were being advised to move away from the area as the response continued. There was no evidence of terrorism or that the cause of the explosion was intentional, according to Acevedo. The owner of the facility told Eyewitness News the explosion originated from a propylene tank. Propylene is an extremely flammable gas that is used to make a variety of products. Two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School, were closed Friday after the explosion. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but will keep students inside due to air quality concerns, according to a statement from school district officials. ""In an abundance of precaution, students will remain indoors at nearby schools due to air quality concerns. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates on the website and social media as they become available,"" Cy Fair ISD officials told ABC13. As schools prepare to let out for the day, Cy Fair ISD officials said that all neighborhoods that were accessible by buses in the morning should be accessible by buses again in the afternoon. They asked parents to be patient as there could be transportation delays. If students are not able to be safely transported home, they will be returned to the campus. Parents will be notified to pick up their children from the campus.  Massive west Houston explosion claims two lives, devastates Gessner-area neighborhoods The explosion that ripped across Houston at 4:24 a. m. Friday killed two workers at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing before radiating outward and smashing into nearby homes and businesses. It knocked houses off foundations, blew doors off frames, shattered windows, cracked sheetrock and jerked residents awake as far as 14 miles away. Firefighters and police officers who arrived at the Spring Branch area neighborhood found debris scattered across an area more than half a mile wide and a community reeling. Authorities were still investigating the cause of the blast. Police Chief Art Acevedo said neither terrorism nor arson is suspected at the family owned machining company, which makes and services parts for everything from the oil and gas to aerospace industries. Late Friday police identified the two victims of the explosion as Frank Flores and Gerado Carasquillo. The explosion damaged some 200 homes and businesses. Police blocked off nearby streets, bordering a mile long hot zone on Genard and Clay roads to the north and south and Gessner Road and Steffani Lane to the east and west. This is a very powerful blast, Acevedo said, at one of several news conferences authorities held throughout the day. FOR SUBSCRIBERS: What we know about Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, the company at center of Houston explosion A hazardous materials team responded, and the Red Cross set up a shelter at a church a few blocks west of the site. Arson investigators and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also joined the investigation. Firefighters took one person to the hospital, Fire Chief Sam Pe a said, and spent hours working to shut off propylene leaking inside the warehouse. Later in the day, HFD officials said an additional 18 people had self reported to local emergency rooms because of problems breathing, cuts, or other injuries. The shockwave devastated the manufacturing warehouse. It crumbled metal siding like aluminum foil. A velocity seismograph, 20 miles away in Hockley, recorded what looked like an earthquake that began at 4:24 a. m. and lasted 10 seconds, said Alexandros Savvaidis, manager of the Texas Seismological Network. Despite the shaking, the blast did not register as an earthquake on the U. S. Geological Survey s earthquake monitors. It did also show up in meteorological data that monitors disturbances in the air. National Weather Service meteorologist Kent Prochazka said NWS equipment registered a cloud of debris and smoke that measured about a nautical mile in diameter. At the site of the blast, neighbors in nearby homes woke to find doors torn from their hinges cracked sheetrock tumbling off walls ceiling fans, screens and blinds ripped from their fastenings. NEIGHBORS REACT: 'I thought somebody attacked us': Gessner chemical explosion devastates west Houston neighborhoods When Alondra Maldonado heard the boom, she thought the neighborhood had been hit with a bomb. Like many others, she d been fast asleep when the blast hit. She ran into her parents room, freaking out. It s scary, I was shook because I literally always walk through there, she said. And my sister, she works in the mornings, so sometimes she walks through there to get to the Metro (bus stop). I imagined her walking and something happened to her. But thank God she didn t work today. Acevedo said investigators would need several days perhaps as many as five to pore over the blast site. He asked residents to look out for debris, which could include human remains. He warned would be thieves that if they tried to take advantage of the situation they would be prosecuted harshly. Do not get caught looting, he said. It will not be a slap on the wrist. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality officials said they were aware of the incident and had sent staff to the area to help conduct air monitoring. Throughout the day, arson investigators and other first responders picked through the rubble at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing. The company was founded 60 years ago by James Watson, who died in 2014. It is now owned and headed by his son, John M. Watson. The chief operating officer is John Watson s brother in law, Robert Bob White. Company officials have not yet responded to requests for comment. The company started small in 1960 and has grown to employ more than 100 people. In 2002, Watson opened the adjacent Watson Valve Services. The company manufactures and services valve and pump components, specializing in large parts, hard metals and exotic alloys. CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN: Explosions and toxic releases are frequent and frightening, and yet the threats are hidden from the public Records show Watson Grinding and Manufacturing ran afoul of federal regulators in 2013, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company about 8,000 for violations related to the control of hazardous energy and wiring problems. It was inspected again in 2015, and no violations were found. Across the neighborhood surrounding the warehouse, local business owners and residents spent the day taking stock of the blast. There s multiple commercial buildings damaged, multiple homes damaged. We ve got insulation blown half a mile from the explosion site, said Scott Huckabee, a volunteer firefighter from the Lake Livingston area who arrived near the site around 7:20 a. m. Justin Travis, the supply chain manager for a fastener manufacturer on Clay Road, was waiting for an inspector to arrive at the company s warehouse, a five minute walk from the explosion site. The disaster wreaked havoc on the facility. Full panels of insulation had fallen from the ceiling tiles, skylights were broken out, and the warehouse s giant metal doors were hanging on by cables. We re going to have inspectors here to see if it s even safe to work because who knows what condition the roof is in, Travis said. The explosion forced the closure of two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but kept students inside due to air quality concerns. Several residents filed lawsuits Friday against the manufacturing company, along with temporary restraining orders to preserve evidence. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, attorney Robert Kwok said in a lawsuit filed on behalf of multiple families whose homes were damaged. I WAS SHOOK : Residents recall hearing massive warehouse explosion in west Houston, only on HoustonChronicle. com The incident is the latest to hit a Houston area company in recent years. In 2014, a chemical leak at a now shuttered DuPont chemical plant in La Porte killed four people. A massive four alarm chemical fire damaged neighborhoods in Spring Branch in 2016. Friday s explosion followed at least five major chemical incidents in Southeast Texas last year. A 2016 Houston Chronicle investigation found there s a major chemical incident every six weeks in the Houston area. In the hours after the blast, environmental watchdogs excoriated another chemical explosion that had claimed more lives in the Houston area, and called for greater government oversight to protect workers and residents living and working near industrial plants. It is saddening and infuriating to see more people die because of another chemical explosion, said Elena Craft, with the Environmental Defense Fund. These deadly tragedies cannot be the new normal in a city and region where industrial threats abound. . Enough is enough.

The two victims killed in an explosion at a Houston manufacturing facility have been identified, authorities said. Gerardo Castorena and Frank Flores, both employees at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, were killed in the early morning blast at the site on Friday, according to the city's police and fire chief. The manufacturing company issued a statement expressing its condolences to the families of the victims, but did not name the two employees who were killed. ""Our hearts go out to the families and businesses impacted by this incident and to our community,"" the statement read. ""At this time, our immediate concern is the safety and well being of everyone in the area and our employees. "" The company was ""working diligently"" with federal, state and local authorities to investigate the accident, according to the statement. It was not yet clear exactly what caused the explosion, but Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena noted there was a leak coming from a 2,000 gallon tank of propylene. Multiple homes and a nearby strip mall also sustained ""significant damage"" in the blast, which happened around 4:30 a. m. local time on Friday, Pena said at a press conference. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said a full arson investigation had been launched, but noted that there is no reason to believe it was terror related or an intentional act. He said it is protocol to conduct an investigation and that it will be handled by multiple agencies to ensure that regulations had been followed prior to the explosion. Authorities urged residents who felt the blast to search around their homes for debris and body parts. Acevedo warned the public not to touch either if they do find them, but to instead call Houston police. Drones were also brought in to conduct a grid search and inspect roofs for debris. Around 18 people checked in at local emergency rooms, complaining of minor injuries from the blast, according to the Houston Fire Department. The propylene leak has been secured and there are no concerns with air quality at this time, Pena said. As of Friday afternoon, authorities were waiting for a fire that was sparked by the explosion to burn out before conducting additional searches. Although contained, the fire was not being extinguished manually by firefighters in order to avoid creating a runoff or other hazards, Pena said. ATF was also on the scene assisting. The explosion was so strong that nearby residents between Gessner Road and Steffani Lane in Houston's Westbranch neighborhood reported doors being blown off their hinges, baseboards blown off and storm doors shattered, according to Houston ABC station KTRK. The force of the blast rattled windows for miles around. Following the explosion, temporary shelters were set up at 4703 Shadowdale Drive. At least 48 people were sheltering there, according to KTRK. Acevedo asked for the public to consider offering help and donating to the families who had been affected. ""This is an area where it isn't the most affluent, so my thoughts are with all the individuals, whether they rent or own, that will be potentially displaced,"" Acevedo said. ABC News' Rebecca Patterson contributed to this report.  2 killed, 20 injured when warehouse explosion shakes Houston HOUSTON A massive explosion Friday leveled a warehouse in Houston, killing two workers, damaging nearby buildings and homes and rousing frightened residents from their sleep miles away, authorities said. The explosion happened about 4:30 a. m. inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. The building was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs. Killed were employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena, Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a Friday evening news conference. The two had arrived at their workplace early and were using its fitness gym when the blast happened, Mayor Sylvester Turner said. Authorities believed there were no other fatalities but another 20 people were injured, two other warehouse workers and 18 others from neighboring homes and businesses, Turner said. None of the injuries were thought to be life threatening. Acevedo had said earlier that a family member of one of those killed was a U. S. Marine currently training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and called on the Marines to let the man return to Houston. Local and federal officials will be at the scene for the next three to four days working through the ruins to determine what caused the explosion, Acevedo said. Authorities don't believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway, he said. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hazardous materials crews have secured the valve on a 2,000 gallon (7,571 liter) tank of propylene that had been leaking. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage. Nearby homes sustained significant damage. Some were knocked off their foundations. Manny Jawa, a volunteer with the Houston office of the American Red Cross, said his agency had helped about 100 people who came to an evacuation shelter that had been set up around 6 a. m. Friday at a church near the blast site. The shelter offered residents food and water and information about help they could receive. Officials said that they planned to open an overnight shelter at a different church for residents who had been displaced from their homes and had nowhere else to go. Danny Wilson, 63, who lives less than a mile from the site, said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up. She heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms, Wilson said. She said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in. Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage. I didn t notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time, Wilson said. He said the blast also broke glass on part of his front windows. Everybody seems to be OK now. That s the main thing, Wilson said. Miguel Ramirez, 65, tried to get out of his bedroom to see what had happened, but his bedroom door would not open. Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door s hinges so he could get out. Once he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed. The explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard. Bits of glass were strewn all over the kitchen floor and a dining room table that still had plates from when the family ate Thursday night. The blast also knocked a light fixture from the ceiling in the kitchen. The good thing is nobody got hurt, said Ramirez, who lives about 500 feet (150 meters) away from the company where the explosion occurred. He lives in the home with his wife, son and daughter. The blast shook other buildings, with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Pena said there were no reports of hazardous air quality, based on monitoring done by a hazardous materials team. The family owned business manufactures valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment used in the chemical, mining, petroleum and aerospace industries, among others, according to its website. In a statement Friday night, Western Grinding said it is working diligently to address the situation and cooperating with the federal, state and local authorities investigating the accident. "" The statement also said: Our hearts go out to the families and businesses impacted by this incident and to our community. At this time our immediate concern is the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the area and our employees. "" About 90,000 people live within 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) of the company, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Houston police tweeted that officers were blocking off streets, but no evacuation was ordered. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said first responders checked on residents of nearby homes. Turner said on Twitter said there was no hazard in the air from all indications, but that authorities continued to monitor. This part of Texas is home to the highest concentration of oil refineries in the nation and has experienced a series of explosions in recent years. Last July, an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown, east of Houston, left more than dozen people with minor injuries and put nearby residents under a shelter in place advisory for three hours. In December, two blasts in the coastal city of Port Neches shattered windows and ripped the doors from nearby homes. Two homeowners are already suing Watson Grinding, accusing the company of negligence and demanding more than 1 million in damages. According to one lawsuit filed by homeowner Sophia Navarro, the blast blew out the windows of her home, with glass strewn inside and outside, and fractured the home's walls and foundation. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions, nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, the lawsuit says. This corrects the identity of one of those killed to Gerardo Castorena instead of Geraldo Carasquillo. Associated Press writers Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Terry Wallace in Dallas contributed to this report.  Houston explosion: 2 dead, multiple injured, homes damaged The blast knocked some homes off their foundations and jolted people awake as far away as Nassau Bay and La Porte. HOUSTON Two people were killed early Friday in a massive explosion at an industrial site in northwest Houston. Authorities identified the victims as Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena. The two were apparently employees of the business and had shown up early to use the gym on the site. A nearby resident was also taken to the hospital with unknown injuries and 18 people self reported to emergency rooms with minor injuries, such as cuts and breathing issues, associated with the blast. The explosion at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing at 4500 Gessner was heard and felt across the city at about 4:24 a. m. Friday. It caused ""significant damage"" to nearby homes and businesses and left a debris field that stretched at least two miles away. At this time there's no evidence of terrorism, Houston's police chief Art Acevedo said. At an afternoon news conference, Acevedo said it was extremely likely the two victims of the explosion were two male employees of the company. The families of both men went to the scene, and vehicles belonging to both men were still there. Two neighborhoods near the explosion were closed off to people who don't live there. Acevedo says no one other than residents would be allowed in the Carverdale and Westbranch subdivisions. Police will be patrolling there around the clock. Views from Air 11 of the blast site showed at least one industrial building completely flattened. Surrounding buildings had their walls, windows and a portion of their roofs blasted away. Watson Grinding released the following statement Friday evening: Watson Grinding and Manufacturing experienced an incident in the early hours of January 24, 2020 that resulted in the fatalities of two of our employees and impacted our operations. ""We are saddened by the tragic passing of our coworkers, and our deepest sympathies are with their families for their profound loss. ""We are working diligently to address the situation and cooperating with the federal, state and local authorities investigating the accident. We are extremely grateful for the brave efforts of first responders who were on the scene immediately, and we will continue to give our full cooperation and support to their efforts. ""Our hearts go out to the families and businesses impacted by this incident and to our community. At this time our immediate concern is the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the area and our employees. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available. Multiple security cameras captured the explosion on video as well as the sound of the blast. One video showed a big plume of flames and smoke coming from the facility. HazMat crews have shut valves containing chemicals, according to the Houston Fire Department. What remained of the fire was secured and allowed to burn off. Chief Pena said he didn't want to add water that could create harmful runoff. Acevedo asked the public to be on the lookout for debris, damage and even body parts on their property. The chief said residents should not touch any questionable materials found and instead call 911. Police also said those with loved ones in the area should check in on the residents. They said if you have concerns about a friend or family member you can call police to check on them if you can't reach them by phone. Homes near the destroyed facility had broken windows and collapsed ceilings and walls. Officials said ingredients used to make polypropylene were released in the explosion.

He toured some of the more than 200 homes damaged by the blast, many of them left unlivable. Even though nearly 20 others were hurt, Mayor Turner said it could have been so much worse. If the explosion occurred two hours later many more people, lives, could have been lost and many other individuals in the surrounding areas could have been seriously impacted, Mayor Turner said. Now authorities are trying to pinpoint what caused the explosion. Mark Wilson, ATF assistant special agent in charge, said they re bringing in their National Response Team to figure that out. Certified explosive specialists, certified fire investigators, forensic chemists, mappers, K 9 units, interview team. It s a team full of specialists, Wilson said. Fire Chief Sam Pena said they have a good idea where the explosion started but they aren t willing to say just yet because they want to leave all their options open. Mayor Turner said the facility had been here since 1972 and many of the communities were built around it. It would be irresponsible on our part not to evaluate and assess what has taken place here today and to do everything that we can to mitigate the risk of future explosions of this kind to the extent we can, Mayor Turner said. The city said all things have to be considered moving forward in a changing city to protect residents. The investigation of the debris field is expected to take several days. Meanwhile, State leaders are reaching out to FEMA Looking at the possibility of getting federal help. Firefighters have gone to nearly 200 homes, telling people there's not a mandatory evacuation but suggesting that people consider leaving the area near the explosion site. With many homes unsecured by damaged doors and windows, the police chief said there would be extra roving patrols in the neighborhood. ""Do not get caught looting because it will not be a slap on the wrist,"" said Acevedo. What caused the explosion? Chief Acevedo said multiple agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, are investigating the cause of the explosion. At the 9 a. m. press conference he said there was no evidence of terrorism. Injuries reported from the explosion Shortly after the explosion, officials said one person was transported to the hospital. Later Friday morning, the Houston Fire Department tweeted that 18 people self reported to emergency rooms with minor injuries, such as cuts and breathing issues, associated with the explosion. Two people, presumably employees of the company, were killed, Acevedo said. If my home was damaged in the explosion, who can I contact? Do you need free legal advice following today's explosion? Call Lone Star Legal Services at 713 652 0077 or the South Texas College of Law at 713 646 2990. You can also contact the Houston volunteer lawyers program at 713 228 0735. What about residents in the affected areas? Two neighborhoods near the explosion were closed off to people who don't live there. Acevedo says no one other than residents would be allowed in the Carverdale and Westbranch subdivisions. Police will be patrolling there around the clock. Because many of the homes that were damaged aren't inhabitable, officials will shift people from a shelter into temporary housing. How you can help explosion victims If you have any donations that you'd like to drop off for families affected by the explosion, please do so at the Duncan YMCA on Clay Road. Is there anything dangerous in the air after the explosion? All readings from HFD indicate there is nothing dangerous in the air. At a news conference this morning, police said polypropylene was released from the explosion. City officials later clarified the release included propylene and liquid nitrogen, which are used to make polypropylene. Is there an impact on Houston schools? Bane Elementary and Dean Middle School were closed today to students and staff all other facilities were open Spring Branch ISD reports that all of their buildings were in good shape, but there could be delays in transportation. They are also keeping students and staff inside as a precaution. All after school activities and athletic events will proceed as scheduled. YES Prep Northwest campus, which is in the area, is open today. They may experience bus delays, but classes will resume as normal. Students will be kept indoors. Houston ISD said they do not have any schools in the immediate area that are being affected and will be operating under normal procedures today.

Spring Branch ISD ( SBISD) January 24, 2020 HOUSTON, Texas At least two people are dead after a massive explosion rocked a northwest Houston neighborhood Friday morning, breaking windows, collapsing ceilings and even knocking houses off their foundations up to two miles away. Officials have identified Gerardo Castorena Sr. and Frank Flores as two victims who were killed in fatal explosions. The explosion happened around 4:25 a. m. in the 4500 block of Gessner Road. The origin of the explosion was at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing , a machining and manufacturing company, according to its website Houston police say the two victims are likely employees at Watson Grinding. Chief Art Acevedo informed the public that the son of Castorena was in the U. S. Marines and sent a plea to community members advising them to reach out to the Marines in order for him to come home immediately. Over twenty four hours later, the Marines agreed to let the solider travel home to be with his family, according to the military group 'Boots for Troops'. A man who spoke to ABC13 said his 6 year old niece was taken to Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital to be checked out. He said her family's house is close to the business that exploded and that his brother told him something fell on the little girl's head. The family is waiting to get more information about her condition. Fire officials say at least 18 people have visited local emergency rooms, complaining of minor injuries and breathing issues. Witnesses told ABC13 they saw two injured people walk out of the debris field moments after the blast. The largest debris field and damage is in the area between Gessner and Steffani Lane in the Westbranch neighborhood. As of Friday afternoon, police closed off two nearby neighborhoods Westbranch and Carverdale that were impacted by the blast. Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena said 180 to 190 homes have some damage. Officials aren't 100 percent sure of the identity of the victims, but they say there is a high probability they are workers because they're the only two people missing and their vehicles were at the location. Acevedo said families of the two victims have been contacted and he asked that people pray for the families. Chief Acevedo said residents would be the only people allowed to go back to those neighborhoods. Earlier," he said patrols will be watching the neighborhoods where people left their homes. He warned looters will be charged. """"You will not be given a slap on the wrist. I want you to think back to Hurricane Harvey when we caught someone looting and they were sentenced to 20 years in prison", Acevedo said. Entire structures were destroyed in the blast. Homes were blown off their foundations in the adjoining neighborhood, authorities said. Broken windows, doors, and garage doors were also reported across a wide area around the blast site. As a result of the blast, at least 48 people were directed to a temporary shelter at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints on Shadowdale Drive, according to the Houston Fire Department. An overnight shelter was later set up at the Fairbanks United Methodist Church at 14210 Aston St. The ATF was responding to the site, although the Houston Fire Department will remain the lead agency, according to ATF spokesperson Nicole Strong. The agency later added that its five National Response Teams were sent to Houston, consisting of 30 members who include arson investigators, bomb technicians, scientists, and engineers. Dogs have been brought in to assist with searching the area. Firefighters were walking door to door in a neighborhood next to the blast site. Crews were being advised to move away from the area as the response continued. There was no evidence of terrorism or that the cause of the explosion was intentional, according to Acevedo. The owner of the facility told Eyewitness News the explosion originated from a propylene tank. Propylene is an extremely flammable gas that is used to make a variety of products. Two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School, were closed Friday after the explosion. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but will keep students inside due to air quality concerns," according to a statement from school district officials. """"In an abundance of precaution", students will remain indoors at nearby schools due to air quality concerns. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates on the website and social media as they become available, Cy Fair ISD officials told ABC13. As schools prepare to let out for the day, Cy Fair ISD officials said that all neighborhoods that were accessible by buses in the morning should be accessible by buses again in the afternoon. They asked parents to be patient as there could be transportation delays. If students are not able to be safely transported home, they will be returned to the campus. Parents will be notified to pick up their children from the campus.  2 people killed in an explosion at a Houston manufacturer that shook the city and damaged homes This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. (CNN) Two people were killed in Friday morning s explosion at a northwest Houston manufacturing business, police said a blast shook much of the city, damaged buildings up to a half mile away and left some residents at least temporarily displaced. The explosion rocked Watson Grinding and Manufacturing around 4:15 a. m. CT (5:15 a. m. ET), tearing apart several structures while sending debris and shock waves much farther, pushing some nearby homes off their foundations, officials said. This is, in essence, a disaster area right now, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said of the area roughly an 18 mile drive northwest of downtown. An investigation into what caused the blast is underway and may take months, Acevedo said. The two men who died in the blast were Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena, both employees of the company, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said. Pena said Friday evening that 214 homes were damaged in some way and, according to an initial rough estimate, about 50 were destroyed. Responding to reports that the explosion was caused by the gas propylene, a fire department spokeswoman told CNN Friday afternoon: We don t know that propylene caused the explosion, only that propylene tanks are on site and were involved in the explosion and fire. The debris field is so widespread officials estimated between a quarter mile to a mile away police have asked residents for help with a potentially grim task: looking for human remains and other debris in their yards and on roofs. Look for any debris, any body parts, anything that may be related, and call police if anything is found, Acevedo said. Besides those killed, the fire department took two people to the hospital, and 18 people went to the hospital on their own, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Friday evening. None of the injuries were life threatening, he said. Many more lives could have been lost if the blast had come two hours later, when more employees would have been in the building, Turner said. In that sense, we are very, very fortunate, Turner said. Blast caused damage some distance away A fireball rose from the scene after the blast, video posted to Twitter appears to show. The distant footage was taken by a camera mounted to a home window. I live downtown, Pena said, and I felt it all the way downtown. The business is in a strip of industrial and commercial businesses, surrounded to the west and east by homes. The nearest neighborhoods, Westbranch and Carverdale, were damaged most severely, Acevedo said. Damage to homes included broken windows and doors, and in at least one case, a collapsed ceiling, CNN affiliates reported. The whole ceiling fell in, a resident told KTRK about her home. I thought maybe the house had gotten hit by lightning. And then I realized there was no storm, the resident told KTRK. Mark Brady, who lives about a half mile from the manufacturing business, told CNN affiliate KPRC the blast knocked us all out of our bed. It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody s garage door in around here and closer toward the explosion over here, it busted people s roofs in and walls in, he said. Mayor Pro Tem Dave Martin said the city is working with various agencies to help move people into temporary housing. A lot of the houses in the neighborhood are not going to be livable for a number of weeks, Martin said. US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents the area, said Friday evening that she had reached out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the possibility of federal help. There are families behind this devastation who are devastated, she said. Firefighters waited for small fires to burn out before exploring blast site Some small fires still were burning hours after the blast, and firefighters let those burn out by themselves before thoroughly searching the site, Pena said. Earlier, propylene gas was leaking from a tank at the facility following the explosion, but crews eventually stopped it, he said. A hazardous materials team has been monitoring air quality, Pena said. We have no concerns about the quality of the air we ve been breathing, Pena said. Fire department inspectors are gathering information about the business s full chemical inventory, and the company s owner has been cooperating with the investigation, officials said. Online records of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration show the company was fined in 2013 for a serious violation related to the control of hazardous energy. The Cy Fair Fire Department Search and Rescue helped out after the explosion and posted photos to Twitter that showed the destruction caused by the explosion. Propylene is a colorless, flammable, pungent gas made from petroleum. It is most often employed to make polypropylene, a kind of plastic used in household products, from take out meal containers to medicine bottles, and in automotive, industrial and textile products. Similar to propane, it burns hotter and can be used as fuel gas and to make acetone. A temporary shelter has opened for people whose homes were damaged A church in the area served as a temporary shelter for anybody that we may have to evacuate out of their home due to damage, Pena said. The fire department tweeted Friday afternoon that 48 people were being sheltered there, and the Red Cross set up an overnight shelter at another church. Police at some point Friday cut off access to the damaged Westbranch and Carverdale neighborhoods, hoping to ward off potential looters. But residents with identification were allowed back into those areas Friday afternoon, Acevedo said. We want people to come back (partly) because we do want people to board up their damaged homes, the police chief said. At least two nearby schools closed for the day. A school district in the area, Spring Branch ISD, said on Twitter that for schools in session, it will keep all students inside today as air quality in the area continues to be monitored.  Texas: Huge explosion rips through Houston building, heard for miles around A large explosion at a building in Houston early Friday was felt for miles away and left rubble scattered in the area (Screengrab from AP video) A massive explosion ripped through a building in Houston, Texas early on Friday, shattering windows in the vicinity and heard by residents across a wide area, police and media said. Smoke and flames could be seen billowing from the area around the blast and emergency vehicles converged on the area. The explosion took place in Gessner Road, in the northwest of the city, Houston police said in a Twitter post. One person was taken to a hospital because of the blast, the Houston Fire Department said. A fire continued to burn at the site hours after the explosion and people were told to avoid the area. ABC s local affiliate KTRK said residents had reported broken windows and doors from the blast and said at least one person had been seen with injuries. It said the blast appeared to have originated at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, a machining and manufacturing company. The company did not respond to a phone call. The blast occurred at around 4:25 am (3:55 pm IST). Building Explosion 4500 Gessner: HPD command post at Tanner Gessner.

Friday killed two workers at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing before radiating outward and smashing into nearby homes and businesses. It knocked houses off foundations, blew doors off frames, shattered windows, cracked sheetrock and jerked residents awake as far as 14 miles away. Firefighters and police officers who arrived at the Spring Branch area neighborhood found debris scattered across an area more than half a mile wide and a community reeling. Authorities were still investigating the cause of the blast. Police Chief Art Acevedo said neither terrorism nor arson is suspected at the family owned machining company, which makes and services parts for everything from the oil and gas to aerospace industries. Late Friday police identified the two victims of the explosion as Frank Flores and Gerado Carasquillo. The explosion damaged some 200 homes and businesses. Police blocked off nearby streets, bordering a mile long hot zone on Genard and Clay roads to the north and south and Gessner Road and Steffani Lane to the east and west. This is a very powerful blast, Acevedo said, at one of several news conferences authorities held throughout the day. FOR SUBSCRIBERS: What we know about Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, the company at center of Houston explosion A hazardous materials team responded, and the Red Cross set up a shelter at a church a few blocks west of the site. Arson investigators and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also joined the investigation. Firefighters took one person to the hospital, Fire Chief Sam Pe a said, and spent hours working to shut off propylene leaking inside the warehouse. Later in the day, HFD officials said an additional 18 people had self reported to local emergency rooms because of problems breathing, cuts, or other injuries. The shockwave devastated the manufacturing warehouse. It crumbled metal siding like aluminum foil. A velocity seismograph, 20 miles away in Hockley, recorded what looked like an earthquake that began at 4:24 a. m. and lasted 10 seconds, said Alexandros Savvaidis, manager of the Texas Seismological Network. Despite the shaking, the blast did not register as an earthquake on the U. S. Geological Survey s earthquake monitors. It did also show up in meteorological data that monitors disturbances in the air. National Weather Service meteorologist Kent Prochazka said NWS equipment registered a cloud of debris and smoke that measured about a nautical mile in diameter. At the site of the blast, neighbors in nearby homes woke to find doors torn from their hinges cracked sheetrock tumbling off walls ceiling fans, screens and blinds ripped from their fastenings. NEIGHBORS REACT: 'I thought somebody attacked us': Gessner chemical explosion devastates west Houston neighborhoods When Alondra Maldonado heard the boom, she thought the neighborhood had been hit with a bomb. Like many others, she d been fast asleep when the blast hit. She ran into her parents room, freaking out. It s scary, I was shook because I literally always walk through there, she said. And my sister, she works in the mornings, so sometimes she walks through there to get to the Metro (bus stop). I imagined her walking and something happened to her. But thank God she didn t work today. Acevedo said investigators would need several days perhaps as many as five to pore over the blast site. He asked residents to look out for debris, which could include human remains. He warned would be thieves that if they tried to take advantage of the situation they would be prosecuted harshly. Do not get caught looting, he said. It will not be a slap on the wrist. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality officials said they were aware of the incident and had sent staff to the area to help conduct air monitoring. Throughout the day, arson investigators and other first responders picked through the rubble at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing. The company was founded 60 years ago by James Watson, who died in 2014. It is now owned and headed by his son, John M. Watson. The chief operating officer is John Watson s brother in law, Robert Bob White. Company officials have not yet responded to requests for comment. The company started small in 1960 and has grown to employ more than 100 people. In 2002, Watson opened the adjacent Watson Valve Services. The company manufactures and services valve and pump components, specializing in large parts, hard metals and exotic alloys. CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN: Explosions and toxic releases are frequent and frightening, and yet the threats are hidden from the public Records show Watson Grinding and Manufacturing ran afoul of federal regulators in 2013, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company about 8,000 for violations related to the control of hazardous energy and wiring problems. It was inspected again in 2015, and no violations were found. Across the neighborhood surrounding the warehouse, local business owners and residents spent the day taking stock of the blast. There s multiple commercial buildings damaged, multiple homes damaged. We ve got insulation blown half a mile from the explosion site, said Scott Huckabee, a volunteer firefighter from the Lake Livingston area who arrived near the site around 7:20 a. m. Justin Travis, the supply chain manager for a fastener manufacturer on Clay Road, was waiting for an inspector to arrive at the company s warehouse, a five minute walk from the explosion site. The disaster wreaked havoc on the facility. Full panels of insulation had fallen from the ceiling tiles, skylights were broken out, and the warehouse s giant metal doors were hanging on by cables. We re going to have inspectors here to see if it s even safe to work because who knows what condition the roof is in, Travis said. The explosion forced the closure of two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but kept students inside due to air quality concerns. Several residents filed lawsuits Friday against the manufacturing company, along with temporary restraining orders to preserve evidence. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, attorney Robert Kwok said in a lawsuit filed on behalf of multiple families whose homes were damaged. I WAS SHOOK : Residents recall hearing massive warehouse explosion in west Houston, only on HoustonChronicle. com The incident is the latest to hit a Houston area company in recent years. In 2014, a chemical leak at a now shuttered DuPont chemical plant in La Porte killed four people. A massive four alarm chemical fire damaged neighborhoods in Spring Branch in 2016. Friday s explosion followed at least five major chemical incidents in Southeast Texas last year. A 2016 Houston Chronicle investigation found there s a major chemical incident every six weeks in the Houston area. In the hours after the blast, environmental watchdogs excoriated another chemical explosion that had claimed more lives in the Houston area, and called for greater government oversight to protect workers and residents living and working near industrial plants. It is saddening and infuriating to see more people die because of another chemical explosion, said Elena Craft, with the Environmental Defense Fund.

This is a company that has been here for many many years and in talking to the employees and their families they re a pretty tight knit group of people. He added that the two people that died are likely two Hispanic male employees that worked at the facility but they have not been positively identified yet. One other person was taken to the hospital following the explosion, according to the Houston Fire Department. A video posted to Twitter from a camera mounted to a window facing the area of the explosion showed a large flash of light followed by flames.

The explosion happened about 4:30 a. m. inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. The building was reduced to burning rubble and debris," and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs. Police Chief Art Acevedo confirmed the deaths Friday and said it was likely both people worked for the company. He said authorities don't believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway.

If you find anything in your immediate home, in your yard," don't touch it. Just call the Houston Police Department so we can respond. """" A home security camera captured a large explosion at an industrial building in Houston Friday morning before it was knocked to the ground. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hazardous materials crews have secured the valve on a 2",000 gallon (7,571 liter) tank of propylene that had been leaking. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage. Houston NBC affiliate KPRC reported many people reported hearing a loud explosion and felt buildings shake near the site of the blast. In a tweet, Houston police asked people to avoid the area as first responders arrived at the scene. Police and fire crews went house to house to let about 300 residents know to shelter in place, Acevedo said. Authorities did not order an evacuation. A worker is missing and another person hurt after a large explosion at a warehouse in Houston early Friday damaged buildings, scattered debris and sent a loud boom across the city.

Miguel Ramirez,65, tried to get out of his bedroom to see what had happened, but his bedroom door would not open. Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door's hinges so he could get out. Once he got out," Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed. The explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard. Bits of glass were strewn all over the kitchen floor and a dining room table that still had plates from when the family ate Thursday night. The blast also knocked off from the ceiling in the kitchen. """"The good thing is nobody got hurt", said Ramirez, who lives about 500 feet (150 meters) away from the company where the explosion occurred. He lives in the home with his wife, son and daughter. It's not immediately clear what caused the explosion.

CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN: Explosions and toxic releases are frequent and frightening, and yet the threats are hidden from the public Records show Watson Grinding and Manufacturing ran afoul of federal regulators in 2013, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company about 8,000 for violations related to the control of hazardous energy and wiring problems. It was inspected again in 2015, and no violations were found. Across the neighborhood surrounding the warehouse, local business owners and residents spent the day taking stock of the blast. There s multiple commercial buildings damaged, multiple homes damaged. We ve got insulation blown half a mile from the explosion site, said Scott Huckabee, a volunteer firefighter from the Lake Livingston area who arrived near the site around 7:20 a. m.

Justin Travis, the supply chain manager for a fastener manufacturer on Clay Road, was waiting for an inspector to arrive at the company s warehouse, a five minute walk from the explosion site. The disaster wreaked havoc on the facility. Full panels of insulation had fallen from the ceiling tiles, skylights were broken out, and the warehouse s giant metal doors were hanging on by cables. We re going to have inspectors here to see if it s even safe to work because who knows what condition the roof is in, Travis said. The explosion forced the closure of two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but kept students inside due to air quality concerns. Several residents filed lawsuits Friday against the manufacturing company, along with temporary restraining orders to preserve evidence. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, attorney Robert Kwok said in a lawsuit filed on behalf of multiple families whose homes were damaged. I WAS SHOOK : Residents recall hearing massive warehouse explosion in west Houston, only on HoustonChronicle. com The incident is the latest to hit a Houston area company in recent years. In 2014, a chemical leak at a now shuttered DuPont chemical plant in La Porte killed four people. A massive four alarm chemical fire damaged neighborhoods in Spring Branch in 2016. Friday s explosion followed at least five major chemical incidents in Southeast Texas last year. A 2016 Houston Chronicle investigation found there s a major chemical incident every six weeks in the Houston area. In the hours after the blast, environmental watchdogs excoriated another chemical explosion that had claimed more lives in the Houston area, and called for greater government oversight to protect workers and residents living and working near industrial plants. It is saddening and infuriating to see more people die because of another chemical explosion, said Elena Craft, with the Environmental Defense Fund.

Blast at machine shop rips through Houston neighbourhood, killing two HOUSTON (Reuters) A massive explosion at a machine shop ripped through a Houston neighbourhood early on Friday morning, killing at least two people and damaging homes while sending out blast waves for miles. The pre dawn explosion devastated two working class neighbourhoods surrounding the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing facility in northwest Houston, leaving behind collapsed and smouldering wreckage on the grounds and knocking several nearby homes off their foundations. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said early indications pointed to a leak of propylene gas, a colourless, flammable, liquefied gas with several industrial uses. But Police Chief Art Acevedo said that was just a huge assumption and cautioned that the investigation could take several days, weeks or months. Officials stressed that they had no reason to believe the explosion was intentionally triggered. The multi agency probe will focus primarily on whether any regulatory violations were committed by either Watson Grinding or its vendors, Acevedo said, adding the company was cooperating fully. While investigators sought to positively identify the two victims, there is a high probability they were two men who worked for the company, Acevedo said. Numerous homes had windows blown in. Others were surrounded by shattered piles of debris. I thought it was thunder, said Bruce Meikle,78, an owner of nearby manufacturer ChemSystems, who heard the explosion from his home about a mile (1.6 km) from the scene. The force of the blast bent the metal loading doors at his business and caused minor damage inside, he told Reuters. Paul Crea,59, a chemist who works for Meikle, said the blast woke him 10 miles (16 km) away in Katy, a Houston suburb, and his dogs bellowed at the sound. Acevedo asked people as far as a mile (1.6 km) away to search their yards and neighbourhoods for evidence. Look for any debris, any body parts, anything that may be related, Acevedo said. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the blast was felt as far away as 14 miles (22 km), based on social media reports. Slideshow ( 8 images ) The moment of the explosion, around 4:25 a. m. CST (1025 GMT), was captured on video by a home security camera. It showed a blinding flash in the distance followed by a fireball. Firefighters secured a 2,000 gallon propylene tank outside the building and would allow any remaining fires to burn out, Pena said. Rescue crews fanned out to examine nearly 200 homes. Slideshow ( 8 images ) Some of them are off the foundation, the ones especially that are closer to the explosion site, Pena said. A temporary shelter was established for people left homeless. Houston, an oil and gas industry hub, is the fourth largest city in the United States with a population of some 2.3 million.

HazMat crews have shut valves containing chemicals", according to the Houston Fire Department. What remained of the fire was secured and allowed to burn off. Chief Pena said he didn't want to add water that could create harmful runoff. Acevedo asked the public to be on the lookout for debris, damage and even body parts on their property. The chief said residents should not touch any questionable materials found and instead call 911. Police also said those with loved ones in the area should check in on the residents. They said if you have concerns about a friend or family member you can call police to check on them if you can't reach them by phone. Homes near the destroyed facility had broken windows and collapsed ceilings and walls. Officials said ingredients used to make polypropylene were released in the explosion.

He toured some of the more than 200 homes damaged by the blast, many of them left unlivable. Even though nearly 20 others were hurt, Mayor Turner said it could have been so much worse. If the explosion occurred two hours later many more people, lives, could have been lost and many other individuals in the surrounding areas could have been seriously impacted, Mayor Turner said. Now authorities are trying to pinpoint what caused the explosion. Mark Wilson, ATF assistant special agent in charge, said they re bringing in their National Response Team to figure that out. Certified explosive specialists, certified fire investigators, forensic chemists, mappers, K 9 units, interview team. It s a team full of specialists, Wilson said. Fire Chief Sam Pena said they have a good idea where the explosion started but they aren t willing to say just yet because they want to leave all their options open. Mayor Turner said the facility had been here since 1972 and many of the communities were built around it. It would be irresponsible on our part not to evaluate and assess what has taken place here today and to do everything that we can to mitigate the risk of future explosions of this kind to the extent we can, Mayor Turner said. The city said all things have to be considered moving forward in a changing city to protect residents. The investigation of the debris field is expected to take several days. Meanwhile, State leaders are reaching out to FEMA Looking at the possibility of getting federal help. Firefighters have gone to nearly 200 homes, telling people there's not a mandatory evacuation but suggesting that people consider leaving the area near the explosion site. With many homes unsecured by damaged doors and windows," the police chief said there would be extra roving patrols in the neighborhood. """"Do not get caught looting because it will not be a slap on the wrist", said Acevedo. What caused the explosion? Chief Acevedo said multiple agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, are investigating the cause of the explosion. At the 9 a. m. press conference he said there was no evidence of terrorism. Injuries reported from the explosion Shortly after the explosion, officials said one person was transported to the hospital. Later Friday morning, the Houston Fire Department tweeted that 18 people self reported to emergency rooms with minor injuries, such as cuts and breathing issues, associated with the explosion. Two people, presumably employees of the company, were killed, Acevedo said. If my home was damaged in the explosion, who can I contact? Do you need free legal advice following today's explosion?

Authorities don t believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway, according to Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. Acevedo asked residents who live nearby to search their homes and neighborhoods for any debris including body parts and to contact police if they find anything that could aid in the investigation. The explosion happened about 4:30 a. m. inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. Police Chief Art Acevedo said one person was unaccounted for after the blast, and the fire department said another person was taken to a hospital for treatment. The building where the explosion happened was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs, footage showed. Danny Wilson,63, who lives less than a mile from the site, said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up. She heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms, Wilson said. She said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in. Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage. I didn t notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time, Wilson said. He said the blast also broke glass on part of his front windows. Everybody seems to be OK now. That s the main thing, Wilson said. Mark Brady, who lives near the site, told TV station KPRC that the explosion knocked us all out of bed. It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody s garage door in around here and closer toward the explosion over here, it busted people s roofs in and walls in, he said The blast shook other buildings, with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Fire Chief Samuel Pena said there were no reports of hazardous air quality, based on monitoring done by a hazardous materials team. A phone number for Watson Grinding was out of service when called by a reporter with The Associated Press on Friday morning. The family owned business manufactures valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment used in the chemical, mining, petroleum and aerospace industries, among others, according to its website. Houston police tweeted that officers were blocking off streets, but no evacuation was ordered. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said first responders were checking on residents of nearby homes. Several people told TV station KHOU that the explosion was so loud, they thought a bomb had gone off or that a vehicle had crashed into their homes. This part of Texas is home to the highest concentration of oil refineries in the nation and has experienced a series of explosions in recent years. Last July, an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown, east of Houston, left more than dozen people with minor injuries and put nearby residents under a shelter in place advisory for three hours. In December, two blasts in the coastal city of Port Neches shattered windows and ripped the doors from nearby homes.

Damage to the surrounding neighborhoods Domingo Duron, who lives in the area, told Houston Public Media he woke up to the sound of the explosion. I heard explosions, stuff on top of me. I looked out the window and saw a fire going up in the air. When I realized what was going on, I realized my roommates were in the other room and I couldn t get to them because stuff was everywhere, he said. I hollered at them and tried to get everybody and make sure they were okay. He said he suffered minor injuries from broken glass. I thought it was war, he said. Thank God we re still alive, but the house is demolished. I m cut up all over from the glass. Officials say there are about 200 homes in the area surrounding the explosion, which occurred near 4500 Gessner Road, north of Clay. We ve assessed between 180, 190 homes at this point. The majority of those have received some sort of damage, said Fire Chief Samuel Pe a. The ones that are more proximal to the area of the blast are damaged heavily, some of them off the foundation. He said they are continuing to check the homes for structural stability. Many have broken windows, alongside damage to garages, walls and roofs. Officials said there was significant damage to an adjacent strip mall as well. Another nearby resident, Alberto O Connor, said his ceiling caved in when the explosion occurred. I had my area I sleep in positioned next to the windows. If it was centered in the room, it would probably have been it for me when the ceiling caved in, he said. I was spared by the hand of God. I had a few shards of glass hit me, but I m here and feel privileged to be here. Authorities continue to tell nearby residents to avoid the area. Cypress Fairbanks ISD has closed Bane Elementary and Dean Middle School. Spring Branch ISD says they re anticipating transportation delays but otherwise are planning for a normal school day. Both districts say they ll keep students inside. Houston ISD will be operating as normal. Environmental concerns Air quality tests by the Health Department continue to show no cause for concern, according to officials. Propylene was released into the air in the aftermath of the explosion. As of 9:30 am, Pe a said they were able to enter the building and secure the leak. We had a 2,000 gallon tank of propylene. That has been secured, and so we don t have any active leak at this moment, he told reporters. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage.

The explosion happened about 4:30 a. m. inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. The building was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs. Killed were employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena, Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a Friday evening news conference. The two had arrived at their workplace early and were using its fitness gym when the blast happened, Mayor Sylvester Turner said. Authorities believed there were no other fatalities but another 20 people were injured, two other warehouse workers and 18 others from neighboring homes and businesses, Turner said. None of the injuries were thought to be life threatening. Acevedo had said earlier that a family member of one of those killed was a U. S. Marine currently training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and called on the Marines to let the man return to Houston. Local and federal officials will be at the scene for the next three to four days working through the ruins to determine what caused the explosion, Acevedo said. Authorities don't believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway, he said. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hazardous materials crews have secured the valve on a 2,000 gallon (7,571 liter) tank of propylene that had been leaking. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage. Nearby homes sustained significant damage. Some were knocked off their foundations. Manny Jawa, a volunteer with the Houston office of the American Red Cross, said his agency had helped about 100 people who came to an evacuation shelter that had been set up around 6 a. m. Friday at a church near the blast site. The shelter offered residents food and water and information about help they could receive. Officials said that they planned to open an overnight shelter at a different church for residents who had been displaced from their homes and had nowhere else to go. Danny Wilson,63, who lives less than a mile from the site, said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up. She heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms, Wilson said. She said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in. Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage. I didn t notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time, Wilson said. He said the blast also broke glass on part of his front windows. Everybody seems to be OK now. That s the main thing, Wilson said. Miguel Ramirez,65, tried to get out of his bedroom to see what had happened, but his bedroom door would not open. Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door s hinges so he could get out. Once he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed. The explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard. Bits of glass were strewn all over the kitchen floor and a dining room table that still had plates from when the family ate Thursday night. The blast also knocked a light fixture from the ceiling in the kitchen. The good thing is nobody got hurt, said Ramirez, who lives about 500 feet (150 meters) away from the company where the explosion occurred. He lives in the home with his wife, son and daughter. The blast shook other buildings, with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Pena said there were no reports of hazardous air quality, based on monitoring done by a hazardous materials team. The family owned business manufactures valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment used in the chemical, mining, petroleum and aerospace industries, among others, according to its website. In a statement Friday night, Western Grinding said it is working diligently to address the situation and cooperating with the federal," state and local authorities investigating the accident.

Two homeowners are already suing Watson Grinding, accusing the company of negligence and demanding more than 1 million in damages. According to one lawsuit filed by homeowner Sophia Navarro, the blast blew out the windows of her home, with glass strewn inside and outside, and fractured the home's walls and foundation. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions, nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, the lawsuit says. This corrects the identity of one of those killed to Gerardo Castorena instead of Geraldo Carasquillo. Associated Press writers Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Terry Wallace in Dallas contributed to this report.

Around 18 people checked in at local emergency rooms, complaining of minor injuries from the blast, according to the Houston Fire Department. It was not yet clear what caused the explosion, but Pena noted that there was a leak coming from a 2,000 gallon tank of propylene. He said the leak has been secured and there are no concerns with air quality at this time. As of Friday afternoon, authorities were waiting for a fire that was sparked by the explosion to burn out before conducting additional searches.

Blast at machine shop rips through Houston neighborhood, killing two (Adds comments on victim identities and focus of investigation) By Collin Eaton HOUSTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) A massive explosion at a machine shop ripped through a Houston neighborhood early on Friday morning, killing at least two people and damaging homes while sending out blast waves for miles. The pre dawn explosion devastated two working class neighborhoods surrounding the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing facility in northwest Houston, leaving behind collapsed and smoldering wreckage on the grounds and knocking several nearby homes off their foundations. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said early indications pointed to a leak of propylene gas, a colorless, flammable," liquefied gas with several industrial uses. But Police Chief Art Acevedo said that was """"just a huge assumption"""" and cautioned that the investigation could take several days", weeks or months. Officials stressed that they had no reason to believe the explosion was intentionally triggered. The multi agency probe will focus primarily on whether any regulatory violations were committed by either Watson Grinding or its vendors, Acevedo said, adding the company was cooperating fully. While investigators sought to positively identify the two victims," there is a """"high probability"""" they were two men who worked for the company"," Acevedo said. Numerous homes had windows blown in. Others were surrounded by shattered piles of debris. """"I thought it was thunder", said Bruce Meikle,78, an owner of nearby manufacturer ChemSystems, who heard the explosion from his home about a mile (1.6 km) from the scene. The force of the blast bent the metal loading doors at his business and caused minor damage inside, he told Reuters. Paul Crea,59, a chemist who works for Meikle, said the blast woke him 10 miles (16 km) away in Katy, a Houston suburb," and his dogs bellowed at the sound. Acevedo asked people as far as a mile (1.6 km) away to search their yards and neighborhoods for evidence. """"Look for any debris", any body parts, anything that may be related, Acevedo said. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the blast was felt as far away as 14 miles (22 km), based on social media reports. The moment of the explosion, around 4:25 a. m. CST (1025 GMT), was captured on video by a home security camera. It showed a blinding flash in the distance followed by a fireball. Firefighters secured a 2,000 gallon propylene tank outside the building and would allow any remaining fires to burn out," Pena said. Rescue crews fanned out to examine nearly 200 homes. """"Some of them are off the foundation", the ones especially that are closer to the explosion site, Pena said. A temporary shelter was established for people left homeless. Houston, an oil and gas industry hub, is the fourth largest city in the United States with a population of some 2.3 million.

Another 48 people have checked into a Red Cross shelter. Officials believe the two victims to be two male Hispanic employees, but the bodies haven t been identified yet. Officials say there are about 200 homes in the area surrounding the explosion. We ve assessed between 180, 190 at this point. The majority of those have received some sort of damage," said Fire Chief Samuel Pe a. """"The ones that are more proximal to the area of the blast are damaged heavily", some of them off the foundation. He said they are continuing to check the homes for structural stability. Ground zero from today s explosion. Please keep our community in your prayers. RelationalPolicing pic. twitter. com/B3ZjKy5d7F Chief Art Acevedo ( ArtAcevedo) January 24, 2020 Air quality tests by the Health Department continue to show no cause for concern, according to officials. Propylene was released into the air in the aftermath of the explosion. As of 9:30 am, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe a said they were able to enter the building and secure the leak. We had a 2,000 gallon tank of propylene. That has been secured, and so we don t have any active leak at this moment, he told reporters. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage.

It is saddening and infuriating to see more people die because of another chemical explosion in the Houston area, Elena Craft, the senior director of climate and health at the Environmental Defense Fund said in a press release. These deadly tragedies cannot be the new normal in a city and region where industrial threats abound. Government at all levels must act to ensure the health and safety of workers and the people living near these facilities, and that starts by holding industry accountable and strengthening safeguards. Enough is enough. Acevedo said there is no evidence that the explosion was intentional, but they will conduct a criminal investigation as part of the process. Authorities continue to tell nearby residents to avoid the area near the 4500 block of Gessner Road, north of Clay. Aerial images show rubble where one building apparently had stood and debris strewn about. Surrounding structures had portions of their walls and roofs heavily damaged. Officials said there was significant damage to an adjacent strip mall as well.

Spring Branch ISD says they re anticipating transportation delays but otherwise are planning for a normal school day. Both districts say they ll keep students inside. Houston ISD will be operating as normal. Mark Brady, who lives near the blast site, told Houston TV station KPRC that the explosion knocked us all out of bed. He said: It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody s garage door in around here and closer toward the explosion over here, it busted people s roofs in and walls in. The explosion occurred around 4:30 a. m. , with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Several people told Houston TV station KHOU that the explosion was so loud, they thought a bomb had gone off or that a vehicle had crashed into their homes. At one man s home about 1/4 mile (0.4 kilometers) away, glass doors were shattered, ceilings were cracked, and the lid of his toilet was even torn off, the station reported. The Houston area has seen a series of explosions over the past year. Last July, an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown left more than dozen people with minor injuries and put nearby residents under a shelter in place advisory for three hours. In November, two blasts in the coastal city of Port Neches shattered windows and ripped the doors from nearby homes. This is a continuing story that will be updated as more details emerge. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the Port Neches explosion occurred in November.  2 Dead After Large Blast Rocks Houston Two people are confirmed dead after a massive explosion early Friday at a Houston industrial company, the city's police chief said. Authorities don't believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway, according to Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. Acevedo asked residents who live nearby to search their homes and neighborhoods for any debris including body parts and to contact police if they find anything that could aid in the investigation. The massive explosion early Friday damaged nearby buildings and homes, rousing frightened people from their sleep miles away and leaving one worker missing. The explosion happened about 4:30 a. m. inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. Police Chief Art Acevedo said one person was unaccounted for after the blast, and the fire department said another person was taken to a hospital for treatment. The building where the explosion happened was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs, footage showed.

Massive west Houston explosion claims two lives, devastates Gessner-area neighborhoods The explosion that ripped across Houston at 4:24 a. m. Friday killed two workers at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing before radiating outward and smashing into nearby homes and businesses. It knocked houses off foundations, blew doors off frames, shattered windows, cracked sheetrock and jerked residents awake as far as 14 miles away. Firefighters and police officers who arrived at the Spring Branch area neighborhood found debris scattered across an area more than half a mile wide and a community reeling. Authorities were still investigating the cause of the blast. Police Chief Art Acevedo said neither terrorism nor arson is suspected at the family owned machining company, which makes and services parts for everything from the oil and gas to aerospace industries. Late Friday police identified the two victims of the explosion as Frank Flores and Gerado Carasquillo. The explosion damaged some 200 homes and businesses. Police blocked off nearby streets, bordering a mile long hot zone on Genard and Clay roads to the north and south and Gessner Road and Steffani Lane to the east and west. This is a very powerful blast, Acevedo said, at one of several news conferences authorities held throughout the day. FOR SUBSCRIBERS: What we know about Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, the company at center of Houston explosion A hazardous materials team responded, and the Red Cross set up a shelter at a church a few blocks west of the site. Arson investigators and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also joined the investigation. Firefighters took one person to the hospital, Fire Chief Sam Pe a said, and spent hours working to shut off propylene leaking inside the warehouse. Later in the day, HFD officials said an additional 18 people had self reported to local emergency rooms because of problems breathing, cuts, or other injuries. The shockwave devastated the manufacturing warehouse. It crumbled metal siding like aluminum foil. A velocity seismograph, 20 miles away in Hockley, recorded what looked like an earthquake that began at 4:24 a. m. and lasted 10 seconds, said Alexandros Savvaidis, manager of the Texas Seismological Network. Despite the shaking, the blast did not register as an earthquake on the U. S. Geological Survey s earthquake monitors. It did also show up in meteorological data that monitors disturbances in the air. National Weather Service meteorologist Kent Prochazka said NWS equipment registered a cloud of debris and smoke that measured about a nautical mile in diameter. At the site of the blast, neighbors in nearby homes woke to find doors torn from their hinges cracked sheetrock tumbling off walls ceiling fans, screens and blinds ripped from their fastenings. NEIGHBORS REACT: 'I thought somebody attacked us': Gessner chemical explosion devastates west Houston neighborhoods When Alondra Maldonado heard the boom, she thought the neighborhood had been hit with a bomb. Like many others, she d been fast asleep when the blast hit. She ran into her parents room, freaking out. It s scary, I was shook because I literally always walk through there, she said. And my sister, she works in the mornings, so sometimes she walks through there to get to the Metro (bus stop). I imagined her walking and something happened to her. But thank God she didn t work today. Acevedo said investigators would need several days perhaps as many as five to pore over the blast site. He asked residents to look out for debris, which could include human remains. He warned would be thieves that if they tried to take advantage of the situation they would be prosecuted harshly. Do not get caught looting, he said. It will not be a slap on the wrist. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality officials said they were aware of the incident and had sent staff to the area to help conduct air monitoring. Throughout the day, arson investigators and other first responders picked through the rubble at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing. The company was founded 60 years ago by James Watson, who died in 2014. It is now owned and headed by his son, John M. Watson. The chief operating officer is John Watson s brother in law, Robert Bob White. Company officials have not yet responded to requests for comment. The company started small in 1960 and has grown to employ more than 100 people. In 2002, Watson opened the adjacent Watson Valve Services. The company manufactures and services valve and pump components, specializing in large parts, hard metals and exotic alloys. CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN: Explosions and toxic releases are frequent and frightening, and yet the threats are hidden from the public Records show Watson Grinding and Manufacturing ran afoul of federal regulators in 2013, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company about 8,000 for violations related to the control of hazardous energy and wiring problems. It was inspected again in 2015, and no violations were found. Across the neighborhood surrounding the warehouse, local business owners and residents spent the day taking stock of the blast. There s multiple commercial buildings damaged, multiple homes damaged. We ve got insulation blown half a mile from the explosion site, said Scott Huckabee, a volunteer firefighter from the Lake Livingston area who arrived near the site around 7:20 a. m. Justin Travis, the supply chain manager for a fastener manufacturer on Clay Road, was waiting for an inspector to arrive at the company s warehouse, a five minute walk from the explosion site. The disaster wreaked havoc on the facility. Full panels of insulation had fallen from the ceiling tiles, skylights were broken out, and the warehouse s giant metal doors were hanging on by cables. We re going to have inspectors here to see if it s even safe to work because who knows what condition the roof is in, Travis said. The explosion forced the closure of two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but kept students inside due to air quality concerns. Several residents filed lawsuits Friday against the manufacturing company, along with temporary restraining orders to preserve evidence. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, attorney Robert Kwok said in a lawsuit filed on behalf of multiple families whose homes were damaged. I WAS SHOOK : Residents recall hearing massive warehouse explosion in west Houston, only on HoustonChronicle. com The incident is the latest to hit a Houston area company in recent years. In 2014, a chemical leak at a now shuttered DuPont chemical plant in La Porte killed four people. A massive four alarm chemical fire damaged neighborhoods in Spring Branch in 2016. Friday s explosion followed at least five major chemical incidents in Southeast Texas last year. A 2016 Houston Chronicle investigation found there s a major chemical incident every six weeks in the Houston area. In the hours after the blast, environmental watchdogs excoriated another chemical explosion that had claimed more lives in the Houston area, and called for greater government oversight to protect workers and residents living and working near industrial plants.

Spring Branch ISD ( SBISD) January 24, 2020 HOUSTON, Texas At least two people are dead after a massive explosion rocked a northwest Houston neighborhood Friday morning, breaking windows, collapsing ceilings and even knocking houses off their foundations up to two miles away. Officials have identified Gerardo Castorena Sr. and Frank Flores as two victims who were killed in fatal explosions. The explosion happened around 4:25 a. m. in the 4500 block of Gessner Road. The origin of the explosion was at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing , a machining and manufacturing company, according to its website Houston police say the two victims are likely employees at Watson Grinding. Chief Art Acevedo informed the public that the son of Castorena was in the U. S. Marines and sent a plea to community members advising them to reach out to the Marines in order for him to come home immediately. Over twenty four hours later, the Marines agreed to let the solider travel home to be with his family, according to the military group 'Boots for Troops'. A man who spoke to ABC13 said his 6 year old niece was taken to Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital to be checked out. He said her family's house is close to the business that exploded and that his brother told him something fell on the little girl's head. The family is waiting to get more information about her condition. Fire officials say at least 18 people have visited local emergency rooms, complaining of minor injuries and breathing issues. Witnesses told ABC13 they saw two injured people walk out of the debris field moments after the blast. The largest debris field and damage is in the area between Gessner and Steffani Lane in the Westbranch neighborhood. As of Friday afternoon, police closed off two nearby neighborhoods Westbranch and Carverdale that were impacted by the blast. Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena said 180 to 190 homes have some damage. Officials aren't 100 percent sure of the identity of the victims, but they say there is a high probability they are workers because they're the only two people missing and their vehicles were at the location. Acevedo said families of the two victims have been contacted and he asked that people pray for the families. Chief Acevedo said residents would be the only people allowed to go back to those neighborhoods. Earlier," he said patrols will be watching the neighborhoods where people left their homes. He warned looters will be charged. """"You will not be given a slap on the wrist. I want you to think back to Hurricane Harvey when we caught someone looting and they were sentenced to 20 years in prison", Acevedo said. Entire structures were destroyed in the blast. Homes were blown off their foundations in the adjoining neighborhood, authorities said. Broken windows, doors, and garage doors were also reported across a wide area around the blast site. As a result of the blast, at least 48 people were directed to a temporary shelter at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints on Shadowdale Drive, according to the Houston Fire Department. An overnight shelter was later set up at the Fairbanks United Methodist Church at 14210 Aston St. The ATF was responding to the site, although the Houston Fire Department will remain the lead agency, according to ATF spokesperson Nicole Strong. The agency later added that its five National Response Teams were sent to Houston, consisting of 30 members who include arson investigators, bomb technicians, scientists, and engineers. Dogs have been brought in to assist with searching the area. Firefighters were walking door to door in a neighborhood next to the blast site. Crews were being advised to move away from the area as the response continued. There was no evidence of terrorism or that the cause of the explosion was intentional, according to Acevedo. The owner of the facility told Eyewitness News the explosion originated from a propylene tank. Propylene is an extremely flammable gas that is used to make a variety of products. Two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School, were closed Friday after the explosion. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but will keep students inside due to air quality concerns," according to a statement from school district officials. """"In an abundance of precaution", students will remain indoors at nearby schools due to air quality concerns. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates on the website and social media as they become available, Cy Fair ISD officials told ABC13. As schools prepare to let out for the day, Cy Fair ISD officials said that all neighborhoods that were accessible by buses in the morning should be accessible by buses again in the afternoon. They asked parents to be patient as there could be transportation delays. If students are not able to be safely transported home, they will be returned to the campus. Parents will be notified to pick up their children from the campus.

The explosion happened about 4:30 a. m. inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. The building was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs. Killed were employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena, Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a Friday evening news conference. The two had arrived at their workplace early and were using its fitness gym when the blast happened, Mayor Sylvester Turner said. Authorities believed there were no other fatalities but another 20 people were injured, two other warehouse workers and 18 others from neighboring homes and businesses, Turner said. None of the injuries were thought to be life threatening. Acevedo had said earlier that a family member of one of those killed was a U. S. Marine currently training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and called on the Marines to let the man return to Houston. Local and federal officials will be at the scene for the next three to four days working through the ruins to determine what caused the explosion, Acevedo said. Authorities don t believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway, he said. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hazardous materials crews have secured the valve on a 2,000 gallon (7,571 liter) tank of propylene that had been leaking. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage. Nearby homes sustained significant damage. Some were knocked off their foundations. Manny Jawa, a volunteer with the Houston office of the American Red Cross, said his agency had helped about 100 people who came to an evacuation shelter that had been set up around 6 a. m. Friday at a church near the blast site. The shelter offered residents food and water and information about help they could receive. Officials said that they planned to open an overnight shelter at a different church for residents who had been displaced from their homes and had nowhere else to go. Danny Wilson,63, who lives less than a mile from the site, said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up. She heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms, Wilson said. She said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in. Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage. I didn t notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time, Wilson said. He said the blast also broke glass on part of his front windows. Everybody seems to be OK now. That s the main thing, Wilson said. Miguel Ramirez,65, tried to get out of his bedroom to see what had happened, but his bedroom door would not open. Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door s hinges so he could get out. Once he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed. The explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard. Bits of glass were strewn all over the kitchen floor and a dining room table that still had plates from when the family ate Thursday night. The blast also knocked a light fixture from the ceiling in the kitchen. The good thing is nobody got hurt, said Ramirez, who lives about 500 feet (150 meters) away from the company where the explosion occurred. He lives in the home with his wife, son and daughter. The blast shook other buildings, with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Pena said there were no reports of hazardous air quality, based on monitoring done by a hazardous materials team. The family owned business manufactures valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment used in the chemical, mining, petroleum and aerospace industries, among others, according to its website. In a statement Friday night, Western Grinding said it is working diligently to address the situation and cooperating with the federal, state and local authorities investigating the accident. The statement also said: Our hearts go out to the families and businesses impacted by this incident and to our community. At this time our immediate concern is the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the area and our employees. About 90,000 people live within 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) of the company, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Houston police tweeted that officers were blocking off streets, but no evacuation was ordered. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said first responders checked on residents of nearby homes. Turner said on Twitter said there was no hazard in the air from all indications, but that authorities continued to monitor. This part of Texas is home to the highest concentration of oil refineries in the nation and has experienced a series of explosions in recent years. Last July, an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown, east of Houston, left more than dozen people with minor injuries and put nearby residents under a shelter in place advisory for three hours. In December, two blasts in the coastal city of Port Neches shattered windows and ripped the doors from nearby homes. Two homeowners are already suing Watson Grinding, accusing the company of negligence and demanding more than 1 million in damages. According to one lawsuit filed by homeowner Sophia Navarro, the blast blew out the windows of her home, with glass strewn inside and outside, and fractured the home s walls and foundation. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions, nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, the lawsuit says. This corrects the identity of one of those killed to Gerardo Castorena instead of Geraldo Carasquillo.

At Least 2 People Killed In Massive Industrial Explosion In Houston Emergency personnel work the scene of the early morning explosion that Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe a said caused significant damage to nearby homes and even knocked some off their foundations. Updated at 2:39 p. m. ET A massive industrial explosion in northwest Houston early Friday killed two people, left a business in ruins, knocked homes off their foundations and sent debris flying for about half a mile. The predawn blast at a building belonging to Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which provides industrial services such as thermal spray coatings, could be felt more than 30 miles away, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference. Acevedo said it's not clear whether the victims were employees. He said authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the incident but that there was currently no reason to think the explosion was intentional. Friday's incident is just the latest in a string of industrial explosions in Texas' Gulf Coast region, which houses numerous chemical facilities. It's not yet clear what caused the explosion," which jolted the area at about 4:30 a. m. local time. """"Multiple buildings and homes had their windows broken in and doors blown off their hinges"," Houston Public Media's Davis Land reported. """" The explosion knocked us all out of our bed", it was so strong," resident Mark Brady told Click2Houston. """"It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody's garage door in around here . and closer toward the explosion over here"," it busted people's roofs in and walls in and we don't know what it is. . It's a warzone over here. """" One resident told the local news station that her roof of her home collapsed. """"The whole house is ruined"," she said. """"The whole ceiling crashed down on all of us. We were all trapped in there and a nice family came and helped us out. . It's just trashed. """" The moment of the explosion was caught on video by a doorbell surveillance camera", which shows a bright ball of fire light up the sky. Authorities initially were concerned because valves on propylene tanks at the site were releasing the colorless and highly flammable gas into the air, but Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe a said the leak has since been contained.

""""This is going to be a long term incident. We're going to be out here for several days"," Pe a said. He encouraged residents who find debris in their yards or on their roofs to call authorities. """"We've actually had to get some of our employees to bring in their own personal drones to actually start looking at rooftops in the vicinity"," Acevedo said. """"We've started a grid search for evidence. """" The police chief also warned against any attempt to loot homes in the area. """"This is", in essence, a disaster area right now," he said. """"Word to the wise do not get caught looting because it will not be a slap on the wrist. """" On Friday afternoon", a law firm that says it represents multiple families whose homes were damaged filed a request for a temporary restraining order against Watson Grinding and Manufacturing so that any evidence at the blast site is preserved. Houston authorities were setting up an evacuation center for residents who need to leave their homes because of damage. Fire and police officials had initially recommended that families leave the area, though they later urged residents to shelter in place. The fire department said 48 people have taken shelter at a church, as the Red Cross works to find an overnight shelter for them. A local school district, Cypress Fairbanks, said it was closing two schools near the blast site on Friday. Several school districts have said they plan to keep students indoors for the day. Nearby roads were being closed, and Acevedo said that would last into Saturday.

In November, an explosion at a chemical plant in Port Neches, Texas, injured three people and damaged nearby homes. In July, more than 30 people were treated for minor injuries after a fire at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Baytown, Texas. And early last year, as Houston Public Media's Florian Martin reported, three chemical fires one of them deadly hit the Houston area in the span of a month. A Houston Chronicle investigation in 2016 found that 12 petrochemical explosions, fires or toxic releases had happened in the Houston area between November 2014 and May 2016.  Police: 2 dead after warehouse explosion shakes Houston A large explosion at a building in Houston early Friday was felt for miles away and left rubble scattered in the area (Screengrab from AP video) Two people died after a massive explosion on Friday levelled a warehouse in Houston, damaging nearby buildings and homes and rousing frightened people from their sleep miles away, authorities said. The explosion happened about 4:30 am inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. The building was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs. Police Chief Art Acevedo confirmed the deaths Friday. He said authorities don't believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway. Acevedo asked residents who live nearby to search their homes and neighborhoods for any debris including body parts and to contact police if they find anything that could aid in the investigation. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hazardous materials crews have secured the valve on a 2,000 gallon (7,571 litre) tank of propylene that had been leaking. Propylene is a colourless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage. Nearby homes sustained significant damage. Some were knocked off their foundations. Danny Wilson,63, who lives less than a mile from the site," said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up. """"She heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms"," Wilson said. """"She said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in. """" Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbours to find out what was going on and to check for any damage. """"I didn't notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time"," Wilson said. He said the blast also broke glass on part of his front windows. """"Everybody seems to be OK now. That's the main thing", Wilson said. Mark Brady, who lives near the site," told TV station KPRC that the explosion """"knocked us all out of bed"""". """"It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody's garage door in around here. and closer toward the explosion over here", it busted people's roofs in and walls in, he said. The blast shook other buildings, with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Pena said there were no reports of hazardous air quality, based on monitoring done by a hazardous materials team. A phone number for Watson Grinding was out of service when called by a reporter with The Associated Press on Friday morning. The family owned business manufactures valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment used in the chemical, mining, petroleum and aerospace industries, among others, according to its website. Houston police tweeted that officers were blocking off streets, but no evacuation was ordered. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said first responders checked on residents of nearby homes.

All traffic avoid hot zone between Gessner, Genard, Sefani Clay Rd. houtraffic hounews CC8 Houston Police ( houstonpolice) January 24, 2020 Several people told TV station KHOU that the explosion was so loud, they thought a bomb had gone off or that a vehicle had crashed into their homes. This part of Texas is home to the highest concentration of oil refineries in the nation and has experienced a series of explosions in recent years. Last July, an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown, east of Houston, left more than dozen people with minor injuries and put nearby residents under a shelter in place advisory for three hours. In December, two blasts in the coastal city of Port Neches shattered windows and ripped the doors from nearby homes.

Massive west Houston explosion claims two lives, devastates Gessner-area neighborhoods The explosion that ripped across Houston at 4:24 a. m. Friday killed two workers at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing before radiating outward and smashing into nearby homes and businesses. It knocked houses off foundations, blew doors off frames, shattered windows, cracked sheetrock and jerked residents awake as far as 14 miles away. Firefighters and police officers who arrived at the Spring Branch area neighborhood found debris scattered across an area more than half a mile wide and a community reeling. Authorities were still investigating the cause of the blast. Police Chief Art Acevedo said neither terrorism nor arson is suspected at the family owned machining company, which makes and services parts for everything from the oil and gas to aerospace industries. Late Friday police identified the two victims of the explosion as Frank Flores and Gerado Carasquillo. The explosion damaged some 200 homes and businesses. Police blocked off nearby streets, bordering a mile long hot zone on Genard and Clay roads to the north and south and Gessner Road and Steffani Lane to the east and west. This is a very powerful blast, Acevedo said, at one of several news conferences authorities held throughout the day. FOR SUBSCRIBERS: What we know about Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, the company at center of Houston explosion A hazardous materials team responded, and the Red Cross set up a shelter at a church a few blocks west of the site. Arson investigators and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also joined the investigation. Firefighters took one person to the hospital, Fire Chief Sam Pe a said, and spent hours working to shut off propylene leaking inside the warehouse. Later in the day, HFD officials said an additional 18 people had self reported to local emergency rooms because of problems breathing, cuts, or other injuries. The shockwave devastated the manufacturing warehouse. It crumbled metal siding like aluminum foil. A velocity seismograph, 20 miles away in Hockley, recorded what looked like an earthquake that began at 4:24 a. m. and lasted 10 seconds, said Alexandros Savvaidis, manager of the Texas Seismological Network. Despite the shaking, the blast did not register as an earthquake on the U. S. Geological Survey s earthquake monitors. It did also show up in meteorological data that monitors disturbances in the air. National Weather Service meteorologist Kent Prochazka said NWS equipment registered a cloud of debris and smoke that measured about a nautical mile in diameter. At the site of the blast, neighbors in nearby homes woke to find doors torn from their hinges cracked sheetrock tumbling off walls ceiling fans, screens and blinds ripped from their fastenings. NEIGHBORS REACT: 'I thought somebody attacked us': Gessner chemical explosion devastates west Houston neighborhoods When Alondra Maldonado heard the boom, she thought the neighborhood had been hit with a bomb. Like many others, she d been fast asleep when the blast hit. She ran into her parents room, freaking out. It s scary, I was shook because I literally always walk through there, she said. And my sister, she works in the mornings, so sometimes she walks through there to get to the Metro (bus stop). I imagined her walking and something happened to her. But thank God she didn t work today. Acevedo said investigators would need several days perhaps as many as five to pore over the blast site. He asked residents to look out for debris, which could include human remains. He warned would be thieves that if they tried to take advantage of the situation they would be prosecuted harshly. Do not get caught looting, he said. It will not be a slap on the wrist. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality officials said they were aware of the incident and had sent staff to the area to help conduct air monitoring. Throughout the day, arson investigators and other first responders picked through the rubble at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing. The company was founded 60 years ago by James Watson, who died in 2014. It is now owned and headed by his son, John M. Watson. The chief operating officer is John Watson s brother in law, Robert Bob White. Company officials have not yet responded to requests for comment. The company started small in 1960 and has grown to employ more than 100 people. In 2002, Watson opened the adjacent Watson Valve Services. The company manufactures and services valve and pump components, specializing in large parts, hard metals and exotic alloys. CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN: Explosions and toxic releases are frequent and frightening, and yet the threats are hidden from the public Records show Watson Grinding and Manufacturing ran afoul of federal regulators in 2013, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company about 8,000 for violations related to the control of hazardous energy and wiring problems. It was inspected again in 2015, and no violations were found. Across the neighborhood surrounding the warehouse, local business owners and residents spent the day taking stock of the blast. There s multiple commercial buildings damaged, multiple homes damaged. We ve got insulation blown half a mile from the explosion site, said Scott Huckabee, a volunteer firefighter from the Lake Livingston area who arrived near the site around 7:20 a. m. Justin Travis, the supply chain manager for a fastener manufacturer on Clay Road, was waiting for an inspector to arrive at the company s warehouse, a five minute walk from the explosion site. The disaster wreaked havoc on the facility. Full panels of insulation had fallen from the ceiling tiles, skylights were broken out, and the warehouse s giant metal doors were hanging on by cables. We re going to have inspectors here to see if it s even safe to work because who knows what condition the roof is in, Travis said. The explosion forced the closure of two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but kept students inside due to air quality concerns. Several residents filed lawsuits Friday against the manufacturing company, along with temporary restraining orders to preserve evidence. This is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion, attorney Robert Kwok said in a lawsuit filed on behalf of multiple families whose homes were damaged.

Massive Explosion at Houston Plant Kills at Least Two, Causes Significant Damage Nearby A massive blast at an industrial facility in the 4500 block of Gessner Road in northwest Houston killed at least two people, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told reporters hours later on Friday. Advertisement The explosion shook the city for miles, according to CNN, resulting in at least one person being sent to the hospital and doing damage to structures at least half a mile away. Per KPRC, it leveled a machine shop called Watson Valve Services (also referred to by Reuters as Watson Grinding and Manufacturing), with the extensive damage to homes including blown out windows, damaged garage doors and more. Resident Mark Brady told the station that the blast knocked us all out of our bed, it was so strong and busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody s garage door in around here. and closer toward the explosion over here, it busted people s roofs in and walls in, and we don t know what it is, Brady added. It s a warzone over here. Another resident, Kim, told Click2Houston their roof collapsed and the whole house is ruined. It s trashed. It s just trashed. Video from a local resident s security camera shows the blast lighting up the night sky at around 4:24 a. m. local time before the camera itself was knocked from its mounting. Acevedo told reporters that polypropylene, a tough, cheap thermoplastic, was burning and emitting fumes into the air but that authorities expected it to dissipate quickly. Advertisement Fox 26 meteorologist Mike Iscovitz tweeted that the explosion was powerful enough to show up on local radar, something he d never seen before. Advertisement The cause of the explosion at the facility was not immediately clear. Reuters reported that Acevedo said police were opening up a criminal investigation, though Having said that, when you have this kind of a type of incident, part of our protocol is to always conduct a criminal investigation. Advertisement Debris was strewn for at least half a mile, Acevedo tweeted. Advertisement This is still an active scene, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe a tweeted. Avoid the area. No evacuation order given at this time. We will advise of the possible cause of the explosion as soon as we have concrete info. Houston is a major gas and oil hub and the region has a long history of industrial accidents, including two fires at an ExxonMobil facility last year (one of which injured 37 people), a multi day fire at a Intercontinental Terminals Co. chemical storage facility in March 2019 that leaked huge amounts of toxin and sent hundreds seeking treatment for benzene exposure, and a 2005 disaster at a BP refinery in Texas City that killed 15 and injured 180 others. Advertisement Hurricane Harvey hit the region hard in August 2017, hitting black and Latino communities the hardest and flooding or damaging 13 heavily contaminated Superfund sites. One site, a toxic waste pit leaking dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls into the San Jacinto River, only saw cleanup begin the next year. Houston s air quality is among the worst in the nation, which Air Alliance Houston blames in part on lax enforcement by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and thousands of industrial emission events.

LOZANO Associated Press HOUSTON (AP) A massive explosion Friday leveled a warehouse in Houston, killing two workers, damaging nearby buildings and homes and rousing frightened residents from their sleep miles away, authorities said. The explosion happened about 4:30 a. m. inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. The building was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs. Killed were employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena, Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a Friday evening news conference. The two had arrived at their workplace early and were using its fitness gym when the blast happened, Mayor Sylvester Turner said. Authorities believed there were no other fatalities but another 20 people were injured, two other warehouse workers and 18 others from neighboring homes and businesses, Turner said. None of the injuries were thought to be life threatening. Acevedo had said earlier that a family member of one of those killed was a U. S. Marine currently training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and called on the Marines to let the man return to Houston. Local and federal officials will be at the scene for the next three to four days working through the ruins to determine what caused the explosion, Acevedo said. Authorities don't believe the explosion was intentional though a criminal investigation is underway, he said. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hazardous materials crews have secured the valve on a 2,000 gallon (7,571 liter) tank of propylene that had been leaking. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage. Nearby homes sustained significant damage. Some were knocked off their foundations. Manny Jawa, a volunteer with the Houston office of the American Red Cross, said his agency had helped about 100 people who came to an evacuation shelter that had been set up around 6 a. m. Friday at a church near the blast site. The shelter offered residents food and water and information about help they could receive. Officials said that they planned to open an overnight shelter at a different church for residents who had been displaced from their homes and had nowhere else to go. Danny Wilson,63, who lives less than a mile from the site, said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up. She heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms, Wilson said. She said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in. Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage. I didn t notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time, Wilson said. He said the blast also broke glass on part of his front windows. Everybody seems to be OK now. That s the main thing, Wilson said. Miguel Ramirez,65, tried to get out of his bedroom to see what had happened, but his bedroom door would not open. Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door s hinges so he could get out. Once he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed. The explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard. Bits of glass were strewn all over the kitchen floor and a dining room table that still had plates from when the family ate Thursday night. The blast also knocked a light fixture from the ceiling in the kitchen. The good thing is nobody got hurt, said Ramirez, who lives about 500 feet (150 meters) away from the company where the explosion occurred. He lives in the home with his wife, son and daughter. The blast shook other buildings, with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Pena said there were no reports of hazardous air quality, based on monitoring done by a hazardous materials team.

Blast at machine shop rips through Houston neighbourhood, killing two HOUSTON (Reuters) A massive explosion at a machine shop ripped through a Houston neighbourhood early on Friday morning, killing at least two people and damaging homes while sending out blast waves for miles. The pre dawn explosion devastated two working class neighbourhoods surrounding the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing facility in northwest Houston, leaving behind collapsed and smouldering wreckage on the grounds and knocking several nearby homes off their foundations. Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said early indications pointed to a leak of propylene gas, a colourless, flammable, liquefied gas with several industrial uses. But Police Chief Art Acevedo said that was just a huge assumption and cautioned that the investigation could take several days, weeks or months. Officials stressed that they had no reason to believe the explosion was intentionally triggered. The multi agency probe will focus primarily on whether any regulatory violations were committed by either Watson Grinding or its vendors, Acevedo said, adding the company was cooperating fully. While investigators sought to positively identify the two victims, there is a high probability they were two men who worked for the company, Acevedo said. Numerous homes had windows blown in. Others were surrounded by shattered piles of debris. I thought it was thunder, said Bruce Meikle,78, an owner of nearby manufacturer ChemSystems, who heard the explosion from his home about a mile (1.6 km) from the scene. The force of the blast bent the metal loading doors at his business and caused minor damage inside, he told Reuters. Paul Crea,59, a chemist who works for Meikle, said the blast woke him 10 miles (16 km) away in Katy, a Houston suburb, and his dogs bellowed at the sound. Acevedo asked people as far as a mile (1.6 km) away to search their yards and neighbourhoods for evidence. Look for any debris, any body parts, anything that may be related, Acevedo said. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the blast was felt as far away as 14 miles (22 km), based on social media reports. Slideshow ( 3 images ) The moment of the explosion, around 4:25 a. m. CST (1025 GMT), was captured on video by a home security camera. It showed a blinding flash in the distance followed by a fireball. Firefighters secured a 2,000 gallon propylene tank outside the building and would allow any remaining fires to burn out, Pena said. Rescue crews fanned out to examine nearly 200 homes. Slideshow ( 3 images ) Some of them are off the foundation, the ones especially that are closer to the explosion site, Pena said. A temporary shelter was established for people left homeless. Houston, an oil and gas industry hub, is the fourth largest city in the United States with a population of some 2.3 million.

Spring Branch ISD ( SBISD) January 24, 2020 HOUSTON, Texas At least two people are dead after a massive explosion rocked a northwest Houston neighborhood Friday morning, breaking windows, collapsing ceilings and even knocking houses off their foundations up to two miles away. Officials have identified Gerardo Castorena Sr. and Frank Flores as two victims who were killed in fatal explosions. The explosion happened around 4:25 a. m. in the 4500 block of Gessner Road. The origin of the explosion was at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing , a machining and manufacturing company, according to its website Houston police say the two victims are likely employees at Watson Grinding. Chief Art Acevedo informed the public that the son of Castorena was in the U. S. Marines and sent a plea to community members advising them to reach out to the Marines in order for him to come home immediately. Over twenty four hours later, the Marines agreed to let the solider travel home to be with his family, according to the military group 'Boots for Troops'. A man who spoke to ABC13 said his 6 year old niece was taken to Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital to be checked out. He said her family's house is close to the business that exploded and that his brother told him something fell on the little girl's head. The family is waiting to get more information about her condition. Fire officials say at least 18 people have visited local emergency rooms, complaining of minor injuries and breathing issues. Witnesses told ABC13 they saw two injured people walk out of the debris field moments after the blast. The largest debris field and damage is in the area between Gessner and Steffani Lane in the Westbranch neighborhood. As of Friday afternoon, police closed off two nearby neighborhoods Westbranch and Carverdale that were impacted by the blast. Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena said 180 to 190 homes have some damage. Officials aren't 100 percent sure of the identity of the victims, but they say there is a high probability they are workers because they're the only two people missing and their vehicles were at the location. Acevedo said families of the two victims have been contacted and he asked that people pray for the families. Chief Acevedo said residents would be the only people allowed to go back to those neighborhoods. Earlier," he said patrols will be watching the neighborhoods where people left their homes. He warned looters will be charged. """"You will not be given a slap on the wrist. I want you to think back to Hurricane Harvey when we caught someone looting and they were sentenced to 20 years in prison", Acevedo said. Entire structures were destroyed in the blast. Homes were blown off their foundations in the adjoining neighborhood, authorities said. Broken windows, doors, and garage doors were also reported across a wide area around the blast site. As a result of the blast, at least 48 people were directed to a temporary shelter at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints on Shadowdale Drive, according to the Houston Fire Department. An overnight shelter was later set up at the Fairbanks United Methodist Church at 14210 Aston St. The ATF was responding to the site, although the Houston Fire Department will remain the lead agency, according to ATF spokesperson Nicole Strong. The agency later added that its five National Response Teams were sent to Houston, consisting of 30 members who include arson investigators, bomb technicians, scientists, and engineers. Dogs have been brought in to assist with searching the area. Firefighters were walking door to door in a neighborhood next to the blast site. Crews were being advised to move away from the area as the response continued. There was no evidence of terrorism or that the cause of the explosion was intentional, according to Acevedo. The owner of the facility told Eyewitness News the explosion originated from a propylene tank. Propylene is an extremely flammable gas that is used to make a variety of products. Two Cy Fair ISD schools, Bane Elementary School and Dean Middle School, were closed Friday after the explosion. Spring Branch ISD remained open, but will keep students inside due to air quality concerns," according to a statement from school district officials. """"In an abundance of precaution", students will remain indoors at nearby schools due to air quality concerns. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates on the website and social media as they become available, Cy Fair ISD officials told ABC13. As schools prepare to let out for the day, Cy Fair ISD officials said that all neighborhoods that were accessible by buses in the morning should be accessible by buses again in the afternoon. They asked parents to be patient as there could be transportation delays. If students are not able to be safely transported home, they will be returned to the campus. Parents will be notified to pick up their children from the campus.

Houston authorities were setting up an evacuation center for residents who need to leave their homes because of damage. Fire and police officials had initially recommended that families leave the area, though they later urged residents to shelter in place.

""""We've started a grid search for evidence. """" The police chief also warned against any attempt to loot homes in the area. """"This is", in essence, a disaster area right now," he said. """"Word to the wise do not get caught looting because it will not be a slap on the wrist. """" On Friday afternoon", a law firm that says it represents multiple families whose homes were damaged filed a request for a temporary restraining order against Watson Grinding and Manufacturing so that any evidence at the blast site is preserved. Houston authorities were setting up an evacuation center for residents who need to leave their homes because of damage. Fire and police officials had initially recommended that families leave the area, though they later urged residents to shelter in place. The fire department said 48 people have taken shelter at a church, as the Red Cross works to find an overnight shelter for them. A local school district, Cypress Fairbanks, said it was closing two schools near the blast site on Friday. Several school districts have said they plan to keep students indoors for the day. Nearby roads were being closed, and Acevedo said that would last into Saturday. Hazmat teams are doing air quality assessments," though Pe a stated: """"We have no reports of accumulation or hazards to the air quality. """" The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality also said it has deployed staff to assist with those assessments at the scene. Late last year"," TCEQ Executive Director Toby Baker said he has seen """"an unacceptable trend of significant incidents impacting the Gulf Coast region. """" """"While not all emergency events may be prevented", it is imperative that industry be accountable and held to the highest standard of compliance to ensure the safety of the state's citizens and the protection of the environment, he added. In November, an explosion at a chemical plant in Port Neches, Texas, injured three people and damaged nearby homes. In July, more than 30 people were treated for minor injuries after a fire at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Baytown, Texas. And early last year, as Houston Public Media's Florian Martin reported, three chemical fires one of them deadly hit the Houston area in the span of a month. A Houston Chronicle investigation in 2016 found that 12 petrochemical explosions, fires or toxic releases had happened in the Houston area between November 2014 and May 2016. Copyright 2020 NPR.

More than a dozen others suffered minor injuries, including cuts and breathing issues," CBS affiliate KHOU reported. The explosion at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing was felt across the city around 4:30 a. m. local time. It caused """"significant damage"""" to nearby homes and businesses. Police Chief Art Acevedo said the victims were likely employees at the company and said it's unlikely that the blast was intentional. He said", however," a criminal investigation was underway. Police said they were blocking off nearby streets and cautioned residents to be on the lookout for debris. """"Do a search around your own home and your own neighborhood", even if you're a mile away from this location, Acevedo said," The Associated Press reported. """"Look for any debris", any body parts," anything that may be related. """" He added: """"If you find anything in your immediate home", in your yard," don't touch it. Just call the Houston Police Department so we can respond. """" Chris Santiff was sitting at his kitchen table when the blast happened. """"All the glass blew through"," he said. Santiff and his wife are now staying at a hotel and said they're worried. """"You expect natural disasters", but you don't expect something to blow up by your house that you didn't know was there, Santiff said. Plumes of black smoke emerged from the blast site. Local fire officials determined initial air quality tests showed no signs of hazardous air quality. Houston's mayor, Sylvester Turner," called the city's air quality """"fine"""" but said officials would continue investigating.  2 people killed in an explosion at a Houston manufacturer that shook the city and damaged homes At least two people were killed in Friday morning s explosion at a northwest Houston manufacturing business", police said. The blast shook much of the city. (CNN) At least two people were killed in Friday morning s explosion at a northwest Houston manufacturing business, police said. The blast shook much of the city, damaged buildings up to a half mile away and left some residents at least temporarily displaced. The explosion rocked Watson Grinding and Manufacturing around 4:15 a. m. CT (5:15 a. m. ET), tearing apart several structures while sending debris and shock waves much further, pushing some nearby homes off their foundations, officials said. This is, in essence, a disaster area right now, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said of the area roughly an 18 mile drive northwest of downtown. An investigation into what caused the blast is underway and may take months, Acevedo said. We don t have any evidence that an intentional act is involved, but police and arson investigators and federal explosives experts will explore all angles, he said. The debris field is so widespread officials estimated between a quarter mile to a mile away police have asked residents for help with a potentially grim task: looking for human remains and other debris in their yards and on roofs. Look for any debris, any body parts, anything that may be related, and call police if anything is found, Acevedo said. Besides those killed, at least one person was injured by shattered glass and was taken to a hospital, Houston fire Capt. Oscar Garcia said. The names of the dead haven t been released, partly because investigators are waiting for small fires to burn themselves out before entering the blast site and confirming who was there, officials said. But there s a high probability they are two Hispanic men who worked for Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, Acevedo said. The two men s vehicles are still at the plant and no one else from the company has been reported missing, he said. Blast breaks windows and damages doors some distance away A fireball rose from the scene after the blast, video posted to Twitter appears to show. The distant footage was taken by a camera mounted to a home window. I live downtown, Houston fire Chief Samuel Pena said, and I felt it all the way downtown. The business is in a strip of industrial and commercial businesses, surrounded to the west and east by homes. The nearest neighborhoods, Westbranch and Carverdale, were damaged most severely, Acevedo said. Damage to homes included broken windows and doors, and in at least one case, a collapsed ceiling, CNN affiliates reported. The whole ceiling fell in, a resident told KTRK about her home. I thought maybe the house had gotten hit by lightning. And then I realized there was no storm, the resident told KTRK. Mark Brady, who lives about a half mile from the manufacturing business, told CNN affiliate KPRC the blast knocked us all out of our bed. It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody s garage door in around here and closer toward the explosion over here, it busted people s roofs in and walls in, he said. Mayor Pro Tem Dave Martin said the city will work with various agencies to help move people into temporary housing. A lot of the houses in the neighborhood are not going to be livable for a number of weeks, said Martin, temporarily standing in for Mayor Sylvester Turner, who was out of state. It wasn t clear how many homes and businesses were damaged. Pena said that out of roughly 190 homes assessed so far, most had some sort of damage. Firefighters wait for small fires to burn out before exploring blast site Some small fires still were burning hours after the blast, and firefighters will let those burn out by themselves before thoroughly searching the site, Pena said. Earlier, propylene gas was leaking from a tank at the facility following the explosion, but crews eventually stopped it, he said. The leaking gas dissipated, and a hazardous materials team has been monitoring air quality, Pena said. We have no concerns about the quality of the air we ve been breathing, Pena said. Fire department inspectors are gathering information about the business s full chemical inventory, and the company s owner has been cooperating with the investigation, officials said. A temporary shelter has opened for people whose homes were damaged A church in the area is serving as a temporary shelter for anybody that we may have to evacuate out of their home due to damage, Pena said. Police at some point Friday cut off access to the damaged Westbranch and Carverdale neighborhoods, hoping to ward off potential looters. But residents with identification will be allowed back into those areas Friday afternoon, Acevedo said. We want people to come back (partly) because we do want people to board up their damaged homes, the police chief said. At least two nearby schools closed for the day.  'I thought somebody attacked us': Gessner chemical explosion devastates west Houston neighborhoods When she looked through what had just moments ago been her sliding glass doors to see a fire across the street, Maria Zuniga thought a missile had struck. She ignored the glass shards and dashed through her home, shrieking for her family to wake up and go outside, now don t wait, don t get dressed, just go. The ceiling fell down, she said. We are in shock. Zuniga,39, and her husband and two children have lived across the street from the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing warehouse for 15 years. The explosion at the plant early Friday morning killed two people and damaged 200 houses. It shook people awake miles away. Those who couldn t see the flames raced online and posted videos captured from their door cameras and speculated whether the boom was an earthquake or a meteorite or the opening salvos of World War III. Close to the plant, residents were left unable to return to their homes in the immediate aftermath and with no idea of where to spend the night. On HoustonChronicle. com: Deadly Gessner explosion the latest in string of major chemical incidents for Houston area It s really scary because I don t know what we re gonna do, said Ashley Colchado, Zuniga s 16 year old daughter, hours after the blast. Colchado had been asleep on the couch when the house shook and the glass shattered. She pulled her blanket tighter around herself and thought she couldn t move, even as she heard her mother and uncle start to yell. Once she assured herself that her family was safe and out of the home save the cuts on her dad s face and legs she thought, Well, I don t know where we re gonna go. Now Playing: West Houston building explosion Video: Houston Chronicle The duplex is the only home Colchado can remember. She walked back through to get her essentials and saw the damage: Glass shards everywhere, windows blown out, the ceiling ripped down, the kitchen lamp on the floor and the brick cracked on the front of the house. Zuniga still has a hard time thinking clearly. The landlord of their duplex hasn t called her back, their 850 in rent is due in three days and the family s most likely option for the night is a shelter. On HoustonChronicle. com: Exclusive drone footage captures the devastation of deadly explosion in west Houston The Nguyen family had intended to spend the night celebrating. Jan. 24 marks the eve of Chinese New Year. The Nguyen family s houses seven doors down from each other on Talina Way, right by the plant were spotless. In keeping with tradition, the families had spent Thursday cleaning. When Yen Nguyen,70, and her brother, Quan, walked back into the house she shares with their 97 year old father, all they saw was the damage. Dust was everywhere. A ceiling panel had fallen on top of the Tupperware stacked in preparation on top of the kitchen table. A light fixture hung from its cords. At Quan Nguyen s house, a piece of the garage had fallen on his Lexus SUV. Yen Nguyen had thought a car rammed into their home before she opened the door to see the smoke and fire. Ken Harvey,72, who also lives by the plant, thought it looked like a tornado had come through his home. At the exact moment of impact, he didn t have the ability to think much at all. On HoustonChronicle. com: What we know about Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, the company at center of Houston explosion Harvey had been awake to feel the explosion. The sheetrock cracked. The ceiling fell down. The bathroom sink fell off the wall. He stumbled outside in the dark and heard a man calling for help. I couldn t see him because it was dark, he said. I m trying to climb over my door and he s hollering, I m messed up! I m messed up! Call 9 1 1! He tried to dial for help but couldn t get through. He thought he heard the man on the phone with someone. Then, in what seemed like an instant, the man was gone. He waited outside a gas station to be let back into his house with his son, Ryan, who lives 30 minutes away but works at a sign design company right by his father. Ryan Harvey got a text from his boss in the morning showing aerial footage of the building. The south wall had collapsed. In the hours Harvey sat watching and waiting, he did not see the man from the debris. I couldn t describe him. I never saw him," Harvey said. I just know he was there.

Carla Ridge,"Carla House tied to Ponzi schemer Robert Shapiro sells Five Southern California properties once owned by convicted real estate Ponzi schemer Robert Shapiro have sold for a total of 69.1 million, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One of the properties is the Carla House, a 20,500 square foot Beverly Hills home designed by Noah Walker, that sold for 35 million. A liquidation entity for Shapiro s Woodbridge Group of Companies sold four residences in Beverly Hills and a small office building in Los Angeles, according to the SEC documents, first spotted by Bisnow. The SEC documents did not reveal the buyers or break down how much each property sold for. The Beverly Hills properties that sold include the Carla House at 1966 Carla Ridge a four bedroom home at 375 Trousdale Place as well as an adjacent lot at 385 Trousdale and 9230 Robin Drive, a 0.95 acre residential site. The Los Angeles property is 8124 West 3rd Street, a 9,100 square foot office building. Compass Sally Forster Jones and her colleague Tomer Fridman had the listing for Carla House, which was put on the market in July for 46 million, or about 2,300 a foot. The sale of the seven bedroom, nine bathroom house closed Dec. 27 for 35 million, or 1,750 a foot, according to Compass website. Jones couldn t be reached for comment, but on Dec. 28 she posted on her Instagram account regarding the deal. Was an absolute pleasure working on this architectural marvel, she wrote. Bittersweet to see it sold. The trust was formed following the bankruptcy of Woodbridge. Shapiro pleaded guilty in August to orchestrating a 1.3 billion real estate Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded more than 7,000 investors, many of them elderly. Shapiro was sentenced to 25 years in prison in October. According to investigators, Woodbridge promised investors that their cash would be used to build and buy luxury properties that would yield high returns. Shapiro and the company were accused of instead buying properties through a web of legal entities to obscure ownership. Investigators said properties and development sites worth hundreds of millions of dollars were purchased in Los Angeles and across the country, with Shapiro admitting that he misappropriated between 25 million and 95 million in investor funds. Among the properties was the historic Owlwood Estate, a 12,200 square foot home that Shapiro bought for 90 million in 2016. Shapiro is also on the hook to pay the SEC 120 million as part of a civil settlement with the agency.

Hood Heights,"Henderson County News: City, developer try to reassure Hood Heights homeowners over sewer line City, developer try to reassure Hood Heights homeowners over sewer line Hood Heights Terry Gibbs makes a point during a meeting last week with a developer who is buying the Halfway Tree Mobile Home Park and officials with the city of Hendersonville. Weeks ago, homeowners in Hood Heights, a neighborhood of nine homes on a short dead end street off Erkwood Drive, watched with alarm as surveyors set up their transits and began taking land measurements. Their concern escalated when they read news reports a few days later that the city planned to condemn land for a sewer easement through their subdivision. We do not live in Hendersonville or Flat Rock but are county residents, said Rosalind Ryan, one of the residents. In May of 2018 the nine of us spent 17,600 to have our private road repaved. The city and a developer who plans to buy the Halfway Tree Mobile Home Park on Rutledge Drive met the homeowners face to face last week after the city scheduled a meeting to explain what was happening and reassure them that their neighborhood would not be permanently scarred by the project. The neighbors concerns arise from the effort by A. M. Partners LLC, of Spartanburg, South Carolina, to fix longstanding septic tank problems at Halfway Tree before closing on its purchase of the 113 unit park bordering the village of Flat Rock. The current owner, Upchurch Marinas Inc. , of South Florida, in November settled an ongoing enforcement action by state water regulators, agreeing to pay a reduced fine of 35,000 and apply for city sewer hookup for the 18 acre park by April 1. All but one family among the homeowners in Hood Heights was represented last week as City Manager John Connet, city utilities engineers and the developer, Tim Manson, explained the sewer line easement and construction process. Surface water pollution from the failing septic tanks was never resolved after numerous attempted enforcement events, Connet said. The need to provide sewer is critical because of the septic issues in the mobile home park. Knowing residents were fearful about what was happening, Connet attempted to assure them that the developer would not leave their roads, yards and driveways torn up. You put your own money in the paving, he said. We re very mindful of that. The ownership of the road that makes up the spine of Hood Heights has caused the confusion that the city and developer are trying to sort out. I was under the impression that the road was a public right of way and once we got into it further we realized it was not, Tim Thomason, the developer s engineer, told the homeowners. Attorneys for the city and the developer researched land records for the area back to 1924 and could not ascertain the exact legal ownership of the road. Some homeowners say they ve always thought they owned the road to the centerline but land records don t confirm that. The only legally sound way to run the sewer line, attorneys for the city and developer advised, is to condemn the property and create a recorded easement. This legal situation is definitely a curveball, Manson said. Legally we re really in a no man s land and as a private entity I can t take the risk and run a sewer line down the road and have someone make a claim to ownership. This is a very complex, very expensive project. It s above and beyond what we originally thought. Manson and City Engineer Brent Detwiler sought to assure the homeowners that the contractor will cover sewer pipe trenches, resew grass, replant bushes and repave the road once the project is done. We ll limit the amount of disturbance on Hood Heights so folks can get around, so we don t have hundreds of feet of trench open at once, Detwiler said. We ve actually done projects like this in the past and these are provisions we require. If a landscape buffer is removed, it will be put back driveways, everything will be as good or better than prior to construction. The developer hopes to have a permit for the sewer line by March and start construction by April. This was the best, most equitable, least disturbing way to be able to provide gravity sewer service to the mobile home park, Thomason said. This was the least disruptive option to be able to get to a gravity flow scenario. But the gravity flow option is not without challenges. A hump in the topography means that the high spot will require the contractor to dig a trench as deep as 22 feet. That concerned Terry Gibbs, a Hood Heights homeowner who is also a grading contractor. I know how much excavation you have to do to dig a hole that deep, he said. Like those in Halfway Tree, Hood Heights homeowners are in unincorporated Henderson County and on septic tanks. Manson said the contractor will install lines from the sewer main for laterals the service lines that lead from a home to a sewer pipe so homeowners can connect to city sewer. I m not totally against what you re doing, Gibbs said. He told Manson he could sweeten it up for these people by paying to run the sewer line all the way to homes. We re doing you a favor. You could do us a favor. The final details for providing of the laterals have not been worked out, Manson responded. There would have to be some kind of stub up for you guys to access. The main will be sized to everybody along the line. Some of you may not want sewer but we will leave the sewer accessible at the property line. Not everyone was happy with that. You are causing a huge disruption in our neighborhood and there s not too much we can do about it, Ryan said. I am adding a lot of value to your property by bringing sewer to your property line, Manson responded. Covering the cost of the laterals all the way to homes Gibbs estimated that running the 4 inch connection would cost around 2,500 is not possible, Manson said. The way I am today I could not commit to doing that financially, he said. When someone asked about annexation, Connet ruled that out. You will not be annexed by the city of Hendersonville, he said. Manson s company has developed manufactured home neighborhoods in the South Carolina Upstate and run sewer lines before, he said, although the legal no man s land in Hood Heights makes this line more complicated than usual. There is still a lot to do, he said. This meeting is a step in the right direction and will enable us to move ahead full steam ahead.

Kimbark Woods Drive,"Man who tossed gun onto school property sentenced to 10 years in prison This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. MEMPHIS, Tenn. A Memphis man who tossed a gun onto school property has been sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Herbert Graham, 32, was sentenced on Wednesday. According to a release from the United States Department of Justice, Graham was arrested after an incident on January 30, 2018. Graham reportedly stole a laptop from a home on Kimbark Woods Drive. The victims found Graham walking toward Raleigh Lagrange, where he is said to have threatened them with a gun. The victims fled the scene and called police. Memphis Police later found Graham walking on Chiswood Street with the laptop in hand. According to the DOJ, Graham saw the officers, dropped the laptop and ran onto the school property of Memphis Rise Academy. Officers chased Graham and saw him toss a gun and the magazine of a firearm on the ground. A faculty member saw the gun, and the school was placed on lock down. Graham was apprehended on the campus a few minutes later. The gun and magazine were found near the gymnasium and music room. The DOJ says the magazine was loaded with 15 live rounds, and the gun had one live round in the chamber. The gun had been reported stolen out of Shelby County in 2016. Graham has prior convictions for aggravated burglary and aggravated assault, as well as a prior conviction for being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun. Graham was sentenced to 10 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release.

Magdalena Ridge Observatory,"New device in New Mexico turns back clock on astronomy In this Dec. 11, 2019 photo Bill Donahue, a retired teacher and director of laboratories at St. John's College, uses an armillary sphere to track planetary rotations and explore the history of astronomy in Santa Fe, N. M. The unique precision steel replica of an instrument created by Danish astonomer Tycho Brahe was commissioned by graduates of the college where students trace the evolution of math and science from early civilizations. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee) SANTA FE, NM A newly forged steel instrument that can pinpoint the path of stars and planets across the night sky using the naked eye is a throwback to the years just before the advent of telescopes, returning stargazers in the hills of northern New Mexico to the essentials of astronomy in the past. Installed at St. John's College by graduates, the device is a remake of long lost originals devised by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century to chart the location of stars and the orbits of planets. It consists of four interlocking rings forged of precision steel and aligned with the north star and equator combined with a sliding viewfinder that is moved by hand to measure angles between the any celestial object, the horizon and the equator. Lengthy, painstaking measurements from such an instrument in the late 1500s allowed Johannes Kepler to show that Mars revolved in an elliptical orbit around the sun, disproving the entrenched theory of the circular movement of heavenly bodies and setting off a search of new theories of planetary motion and forces. Ad You can often learn things about how science was done in another age by recreating the artifacts and recreating the instruments, said William Donahue, a retired faculty member and laboratories director at St. John s College, whose campus overlooks Santa Fe. This is a lot of fun because you get to do things that nobody has done for 300 years. None of Brahe s original instruments have survived. Graduates of St. John s commissioned a functioning replica using Brahe s original drawings and illustrations. They hired British craftsman David Harber to assemble a precision instrument from surgical stainless steel. The venture cost upwards of 100,000, Donahue said. Static sculptures of Brahe's so called armillary sphere proliferate in public parks, but few if any allow for detailed measurements like the one in Santa Fe. It is accurate to incremental angular measurements of one sixtieth of a degree, or 1 arc minute. Ad The device is an obvious anachronism in an age of sky charting smart phone apps and a fitting addition to St. John s College, where students trace the evolution of math and science from ancient civilizations by studying original texts or their English translations. Beyond St. John's, New Mexico's dark cloudless skies have attracted groundbreaking astronomical devices and student observatories. They include New Mexico Tech s Magdalena Ridge Observatory, perched 2 miles (3 kilometers) above sea level near Socorro a cluster of research telescopes at Apache Point Observatory the iconic Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory where antennae span miles across the Plains of San Agustin: and recently assembled radio scopes that explore low frequencies for clues about cosmic evolution. By contrast, the latest stargazing device in Santa Fe promises no scientific advances. Instead, it's something of a time portal into the travails of 16th century astronomy. Ad Donahoe, who translated Kepler s Astronomia Nova from Latin, says pinpointing the coordinates of bright stars and planets produces lots of ah hah moments"" for student. The sphere is not yet part of the college curriculum. Measurements taken by Brahe were accurate enough to challenge fundamental astronomical conceptions and misconceptions and help pave the way for Isaac Newton's theory of gravity and the laws of motion, Donahue says. Tracking orbits also was no easy feat in an age where mechanical clocks could be maddeningly inaccurate. Then came the telescope. In 1609 Galileo turned his telescope on the sky and that changed everything, Donahue said.

They include New Mexico Tech s Magdalena Ridge Observatory, perched three kilometres above sea level near Socorro a cluster of research telescopes at Apache Point Observatory the iconic Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory where antennae span miles across the Plains of San Agustin: and recently assembled radio scopes that explore low frequencies for clues about cosmic evolution. By contrast, the latest stargazing device in Santa Fe promises no scientific advances. Instead, it s something of a time portal into the travails of 16th century astronomy. Donahoe, who translated Kepler s Astronomia Nova from Latin, says pinpointing the coordinates of bright stars and planets produces lots of ah hah moments for the student. The sphere is not yet part of the college curriculum. Measurements taken by Brahe were accurate enough to challenge fundamental astronomical conceptions and misconceptions and help pave the way for Isaac Newton s theory of gravity and the laws of motion, Donahue says. Tracking orbits also was no easy feat in an age where mechanical clocks could be maddeningly inaccurate. Then came the telescope. In 1609 Galileo turned his telescope on the sky and that changed everything, Donahue said.

Civil Defense Caves,"Dismembered body in Idaho cave is bootlegger, murderer slain in 1916 Investigators have been working to solve the case since 1979, when the man's headless torso was discovered in the Civil Defense Caves near Dubois. DUBOIS, Idaho Investigators have finally put a name to a man whose dismembered body was discovered in a cave near Dubois decades ago. Forensic genealogy and DNA testing helped identify the so called ""Clark County John Doe"" as Joseph Henry Loveless, who is believed to have been about 46 at the time of his death in 1916. Loveless' headless torso, wearing a dark red sweater and wrapped up in burlap, was found in the Idaho Civil Defense Caves by a family hunting for arrowheads in 1979. In 1991, a little girl exploring the same cave stumbled on more body parts, eventually leading to the recovery of Loveless' arms and legs. The then unidentified man's head was missing and has not been recovered, despite extensive searches by law enforcement. Loveless' remains were examined by both FBI forensic specialists and the Smithsonian in hopes of making an identification, without any luck. The case was ultimately handed over to Idaho State University's anthropological researchers, who worked with the Clark County Sheriff's Office and the DNA Doe Project. With funding from the DNA Doe Project, the investigators tried to determine whether DNA testing could help identify the dead man. The remains were digitized at the Othram Inc. laboratory in Texas, and forensic teams began working to build a genetic family tree they hoped could lead them to a name. It worked. The genealogy profile led to a living descendant of Loveless, whose DNA investigators also tested. The results came back as ""one to one match. "" That living descendant would be discovered to be Loveless' 87 year old grandson. ""We can now confidently say that the torso found in the Civil Caves in 1979 belonged to Joseph Henry Loveless, born in Utah Territory in 1870,"" said Anthony Redgrave, team leader at the DNA Doe Project. ""This is one of the oldest cases solved using autosomal DNA. We solved the case in about three and a half months after getting the DNA information back from the lab. "" Although law enforcement had originally believed the victim had been dead for about four decades, investigators instead learned that the man had been killed 103 years prior, making the case among the oldest to ever be solved with forensic genealogy. Loveless, who was born in 1870 in Payson, Utah was a bootlegger and counterfeiter who used aliases including Walter Currans, Walter Cairnes, and Charles Smith, among other names. He had repeated run ins with the law, and escaped from jail multiple times with a saw he kept hidden in his shoe. In May 1916, investigators learned, Loveless attacked his wife Agnes Octavia Caldwell with an axe, killing her. Loveless went on the run, wearing a maroon sweater and overalls, but did not make it far. All of this was confirmed through research and old police records. He was murdered and cut into pieces in the Civil Defense Caves that same year, investigators say. The man's killer or killers have not been identified, and it's unclear what the motive was behind his death. The Clark County Sheriff's Office said his death is considered an open homicide and detectives will continue to work on developments in the case, if possible. Although no photo was available of Loveless, the sheriff's office has released a composite created from photographs of his relatives and a physical description on his wanted poster. ""Our team is proud to have helped law enforcement with this historic identification as it showcases the power of Othram's forensic sequencing in digitizing and preserving even the most degraded and contaminated evidence, "" Othram CEO David Mittelman said in a statement. ""We look forward to scaling this approach in the New Year to bring this technology to more unsolved cases. "" Human remains found in Idaho cave identified as outlaw who died over 100 years ago Officials in Idaho on Tuesday announced that human remains found in a cave from a decades old cold case have been identified. The dismembered and headless John Doe, whose remains were found in the Civil Defense Caves near Dubois, Idaho, in 1979 and 1991, was identified as those of Joseph Henry Loveless. His remarkably preserved remains are thought to have been placed in the caves in 1916. The announcement was made by the DNA Doe Project, a nonprofit organization that identifies Jane and John Does through advanced genetic genealogy techniques. A composite image created by the DNA Doe Project attempts to show what Joseph Henry Loveless might have looked like. DNA Doe Project ""With the combined efforts of 14 volunteer genealogists over the course of 15 weeks, we put in over 2,000 hours of genealogical research into this identification,"" said Anthony Redgrave, team leader for Clark County John Doe at the DNA Doe Project. Officials said Loveless was an outlaw and a murderer who was born in 1870 in Payson, Utah Territory, to Sarah Jane Scriggins and Joseph Jackson Loveless. His mother hailed from Massachusetts, and his father came from Indiana. Both came to the territory as early pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. Download the NBC News app for breaking news In 1899, at age 28, he married Harriett Jane ""Hattie"" Savage in Salt Lake City, according to the DNA Doe Project. They divorced by 1904. ""Hattie filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion and failure to provide for her and their one daughter,"" the nonprofit said, citing newspaper reports and court proceedings. A year later, in August 1905, Loveless was in Idaho and married Agnes Octavia Caldwell, with whom he had four children from 1906 to 1913. In March and December 1914, Loveless was arrested for bootlegging, according to the DNA Doe Project. Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, 1880 1916, was murdered by her husband, Joseph Henry Loveless. Courtesy of DNA Doe Project ""In December, he made one of his many escapes by sawing through the jail bars,"" the organization said. In March 1916, newspaper reports said a man now presumed by the DNA Doe Project to be Loveless somehow stopped a train that was escorting him to jail and tried to escape. He was recaptured and sent to jail and escaped from that jail. On May 5, 1916, Loveless' wife, Agnes Caldwell Loveless, was murdered with an ax by a man called ""Charles Smith,"" who is described in some reports as her husband. At least two of their children were present. On May 11, Agnes Loveless' murderer was arrested under the name ""Walter Currans"" for the murder of his common law wife. At Agnes Loveless' funeral, one of her children was quoted as saying, ""Papa never stayed in jail very long and he'll soon be out. "" Several days later, a ""Walter Cairns"" escaped from jail by sawing through the bars using a saw he had hidden in his shoe. ""As we pieced these stories together, the reports clearly suggested that Walter Cairns, (Walter Currans), Charles Smith and Joseph Henry Loveless were all the same person, and that Agnes Loveless was murdered by her husband,"" the DNA Doe Project said. ""This was later confirmed by the Clark County Sheriff's Office via police records. "" The DNA Doe Project believes Loveless died at age 46 murdered and was transported to the cave shortly after he escaped jail in May of 1916. It is unknown who killed and dismembered him. His torso was found in a burlap sack in caves in 1979 by artifact hunters, and his arms and legs were discovered in 1991 by a little girl exploring the same area. His head was never found. ""His remains were preserved . for as long as 63 years, well surpassing the estimated post mortem interval of six months to five years,"" the organization said in a statement on its Facebook page. No photos of Loveless have been found, so a composite image was made from photos of his close relatives and physical descriptions in documents for illustrative purposes.  Infamous Buffalo Cave Torso Identified, One of the Oldest Cases Resolved Using Forensic Genealogy Known as the Civil Defense Caves in Dubois, Idaho, the ancient lava tubes, once a valuable resource during the Cold War, have become a family excursion for exploring the easily accessible caves. In August of 1979, one family hunting for arrowheads in the caves, instead turned up a headless, burlap wrapped male torso. Local law enforcement had little to go on except that the torso was found outfitted in a dark red sweater. A little over a decade later, another youngster exploring the same cave came up with more burlap wrapped remains: two arms and two legs. Law enforcement brought in volunteers to search for a key component to the mystery, the head. Unfortunately, it was not found, and the case eventually went cold. The remains, which became known as the Buffalo Cave Torso, were examined by the FBI s elite forensic team with no resulting identification, and also examined at the Smithsonian, again without an identification being made. The case was eventually turned over to Idaho State University s anthropological researchers in cooperation with the Clark County Sheriff s Office. Dr. Amy Michael, at the University of New Hampshire and formerly of ISU, and Dr. Samantha Blatt at ISU reached out to Anthony Redgrave for help. Redgrave is a team leader at the DNA Doe Project and the lead forensic genealogist at Othram. With funding assistance from the DNA Doe Project, work began to see if DNA testing could reveal the identity of these remains. Othram s laboratory digitized the degraded remains from this case using Forensic Grade Genome Sequencing . Once the genetic data was generated, Redgrave and his team took over building a genetic genealogical tree and what happened next was a surprise to everyone. The Buffalo Cave Torso was not forty or so years old. It was an incredible 103 years old. In a press conference held on December 31, 2019 at the Clark County Community Center in Dubois, Idaho, the Clark County Sheriff s office announced the identity of the victim and expressed thanks to the team for enabling a positive identification. We can now confidently say that the torso found in the Civil Caves in 1979 belonged to Joseph Henry Loveless, born in Utah Territory in 1870, Anthony Redgrave commented. This is one of the oldest cases solved using autosomal DNA. We solved the case in about three and a half months after getting the DNA information back from the lab. Henry Loveless, born in 1870, and murdered in 1916, was a known bootlegger and counterfeiter. He had many encounters with the law and went by a number of aliases, including Walter Currans/Cairins, Cairns and Charles Smith. In May of 1916, he took an axe to his wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell and fled, wearing a maroon sweater under overalls. Having escaped jail numerous times with a saw kept secretly in his shoe, he eventually befell a grisly fate, not unlike that which he inflicted on his wife, in the depths of the Civil Defense Caves of Idaho. ""Our team is proud to have helped law enforcement with this historic identification as it showcases the power of Othram's forensic sequencing in digitizing and preserving even the most degraded and contaminated evidence, "" said David Mittelman, Othram CEO, ""We look forward to scaling this approach in the New Year to bring this technology to more unsolved cases.

Identity of a man found in a cave 40 years ago has been revealed, along with his colorful criminal past UPDATE: Click here for a presentation on this story from Idaho State University. DUBOIS Nobody could have guessed the identity of a man whose body was found in the Civil Defense Caves in 1979. For 40 years, anthropologists, scientists and investigators from Idaho State University all the way to the Smithsonian and the FBI tried to unravel the mystery of who this man was. The big question none of them could figure out was how long he had been in the caves. The answers were revealed Tuesday during a riveting news conference held by Clark County Sheriff Bart May and others involved in the decades long investigation. The man s remains were so well preserved, there was still skin on the body. Anthropologists believed that he had maybe only been in the caves for five to 10 years. When the DNA Doe Project finally put the genetic and genealogical pieces together, they learned he had been in the cave since 1916. Through our research, following the tireless experts of innumerable experts, we have identified Clark County John Doe. His name was Joseph Henry Loveless, DNA Doe Project team leader Anthony Redgrave said. Joseph Henry Loveless was born Dec. 3, 1870, in Payson, Utah territory. Loveless was a notorious outlaw, bootlegger, jailbird and a vicious murderer, according to newspaper records from the era. The revelation that the man anthropologists believed had likely died sometime between 1969 and 1979 had actually died in 1916 was a shocking revelation. This definitely threw most anthropologists all anthropologists that looked at this (case), ISU anthropology department assistant professor Samantha Blatt said. Loveless torso, arms and legs have been recovered, but his head has never been found. Researchers have not been able to uncover a photo of him either. Fortunately, the wanted poster published from when he murdered his wife has a description of what he looked like, although he was going by a different name at the time. Walt Cairns, age about 40 years, height about 5 ft. 8 or 9 in. , weight about 165 pounds, dark brown hair, slightly gray around ears, eyes bluish brown, medium complexion, has little or no eyebrows, small scar over right eye, tattoo of star on right hand between thumb and index finger, also tattoo of anchor same place on left hand he wore a light colored hat, brown coat, red sweater, blue overalls over black trousers, the poster reads.

Courtesy DNA Doe Project The story of how scientists and historians identified Loveless is remarkable. Redgrave said this is now one of the oldest cases to be solved using DNA. Road to identification On Aug. 26, 1979, a family was searching for arrowheads in a cave near the entrance of the Civil Defense Caves just north of Dubois. Instead of arrowheads, they found something else. Wrapped in burlap and buried in a shallow grave was the headless torso of a man. He was wearing a white shirt with blue pinstripes and a maroon sweater. He was also missing his arms and legs. Earl Holden, the Clark County sheriff at the time, had the area searched for any other remains, but to no avail. He believed, based on the clothing the man was wearing, that he was likely a gambler from 60 years prior. Coroner Ernest Sill performed an investigation and determined the man must have died within the last decade due to the presence of flesh and odor. The shirt Loveless was wearing and piece of burlap the body was wrapped in. Courtesy NamUs. gov Sill wasn t the only one who thought that. In 1979, the top forensic anthropologist in the world, Dr. Doug Ubelaker from the Smithsonian Institute, believed the remains could have been anywhere from six months to ten years old. Already, at the beginning, no one could identify who this person was, ISU anthropology department assistant professor Samantha Blatt said. Twelve years later, an 11 year old girl was exploring the cave when she discovered a hand sticking out of the ground. An excavation led by Idaho State University and the Idaho Museum of Natural History uncovered the man s arms and legs. In 1997, the remains were transferred to the ISU Anthropology Department where they have remained ever since. In March 2019, Drs. Amy Michael and Samantha Blatt with the Idaho State University Anthropology Department decided to ask if DNA Doe Project would be willing to help try to identify the man in the cave. DNA Doe Project is a nonprofit organization that uses a methodology known as genetic genealogy to identify unknown individuals by using their DNA to find their family tree. Volunteers search through records and other sources to piece the individual s family history together until they are able to identify the person. Led by team leader Anthony Redgrave, 14 volunteer genealogists spent more than 2,000 hours researching Clark County John Doe s family tree. They found 31,730 individuals in the tree and narrowed their investigation down to 250 DNA cousins. Searching through those family trees, they tentatively identified the man as Joseph Henry Loveless. The genealogists discovered Loveless parents were Latter day Saint pioneers from Utah Valley and were polygamists, which made DNA Doe Project s job much more difficult.

Mike Price, EastIdahoNews. com Descendants of pioneers who have done their family history will know that their ancestors had many, many children often with several different spouses during the time period that polygamy was practiced, Redgrave said. He said that often leads to intermarrying, which can affect the DNA in unpredictable ways. It also leads to half relationships or half cousins where two people only share DNA with one parent. Redgrave said that even though they had numerous close DNA matches, it was difficult to work with and narrow down to one individual. We took a lot of extra effort to confirm our potential identity over the course of several days, Redgrave said. Even then, Sheriff May wanted to make extra sure the identity was correct. I felt like we needed to take it a step farther to make sure we were 100 percent correct. So we tracked down living relatives, which was really hard to do. But we found an 87 year old grandson who was willing to talk with us and meet with us and give us his DNA, May said. Through the grandson s DNA, authorities were able to confirm the remains did belong to Loveless. This was an amazing case because watching it progress, it was so difficult because of the intermarriages and the Latter day Saints practice of polygamy. There were many, many complicated family relationships that we thought would take forever to untangle, DNA Doe Project Co founder Dr. Margaret Press said. The outlaw Finding Loveless body was one thing. Finding out details about his life was another. To do that, DNA Doe Project searched through eastern Idaho newspaper records. The man they discovered had a notorious reputation. Loveless was born to Latter day Saint pioneers Joseph Jackson Loveless and Sarah Jane Scriggins. When he was 28, in 1899, Loveless married Harriett Jane Savage in Salt Lake City. Five years later, Harriett filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion and failure to support their child. A year after the divorce, Loveless married Agnes Octavia Caldwell in Bear Lake County, Idaho. They had four children together, but Loveless wasn t the type to settle down. In 1914, he was arrested for bootlegging in Burley. A few months later, he was again arrested for bootlegging in Burley but he managed to escape from jail and it wouldn t be the last time. In 1916, newspaper records show a man named Walter Garron pulled off a daring escape by cutting his jail cell s bars with a saw and then stopping a train. The news article is strangely worded, but we assume he was being transported to jail on a train and somehow stopped the train in an attempt to escape it, Redgrave said. He was somehow caught and put in prison and escaped again anyway. Wanted poster for Loveless under the alias Walt Cairns. Courtesy DNA Doe Project Walter Garron was just one of the various aliases Loveless went by. Others included Walter Cairins, Curran, Currans, Cairns, Curnans, and Charles Smith. On May 5, 1916, Agnes Loveless was found dead in the tent she, Loveless and their 8 year old son lived in on the outskirts of Dubois. Loveless was nowhere to be found and became the prime suspect. The problem was, he and his wife were using aliases at the time. The couple, both suspected bootleggers, were known in town as Charles and Ada Smith. This led to confusion among researchers about who killed Agnes and where Loveless was. They eventually came to the conclusion that Charles and Ada Smith were, in fact, Joseph and Agnes Loveless. On May 12, 1916, the Pocatello Chronicle published an article titled Under Arrest on Murder Charge. Law enforcement had arrested a man they believed to be Walter Currans (Joseph Loveless) for Ada Smith s (Agnes Loveless) murder. Sheriff John Spencer of Fremont County in Spencer, Ida. , charged (him) with beating out his wife s brains. Her death resulted after 50 hours of intense agony. It is charged that the ax was wielded by her common law husband in Dubois at an early hour Saturday morning after she had returned home from a dance in that city, the article read. According to the news article, their 8 year old son found her after she had been beaten to death with an ax. At Agnes funeral, one of their children was quoted as saying, Papa never stayed in jail very long, and he ll soon be out. On May 23, 1916, Loveless escaped from jail again by cutting the bars using a saw he had hidden in his shoes. After that, Loveless wasn t seen again until his headless, dismembered corpse was discovered in 1979. It s not clear who murdered Loveless, or how he was killed. There is a near certainty, though, that his killer is also dead. Despite that, the Clark County Sheriff s Office plans to continue the investigation and hopes to discover who killed Loveless. This is one of the most exciting cases we have worked, said forensic genealogist Lee Redgrave, Anthony Redgrave s wife.

Remains found in Idaho cave ID'd as outlaw who died over 100 years ago Officials in Idaho on Tuesday announced that human remains found in a cave from a decades old cold case have been identified. The dismembered and headless John Doe, whose remains were found in the Civil Defense Caves near Dubois, Idaho, in 1979 and 1991, was identified as Joseph Henry Loveless. His remarkably preserved remains are now thought to have been placed in the caves in 1916.

Officials said Loveless was an outlaw and murderer, born in 1870 in Payson, Utah Territory, to Sarah Jane Scriggins and Joseph Jackson Loveless. His mother hailed from Massachusetts and his father from Indiana. Both came to the territory as early pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. In 1899, at age 28, he married Harriett Jane Hattie Savage in Salt Lake City," according to the DNA Doe Project. They divorced by 1904. """"Hattie filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion and failure to provide for her and their one daughter", the nonprofit said, citing newspaper reports and court proceedings. A year later, in August 1905, Loveless was in Idaho and married Agnes Octavia Caldwell, with whom he had four children between 1906 and 1913. In March and December of 1914, Loveless was arrested for bootlegging," according to the DNA Doe Project. """"In December", he made one of his many escapes by sawing through the jail bars, the organization said. In March of 1916, newspaper reports said a man now presumed by the DNA Doe Project to be Loveless somehow stopped a train that was escorting him to jail and attempted to escape the train. He was recaptured, sent to jail and escaped from that jail. On May 5,1916, Loveless' wife, Agnes Caldwell Loveless," was murdered with an axe by a man called """"Charles Smith", who is described in some reports as her husband. At least two of their children were present at the time of her murder. On May 11," Agnes Loveless' murderer was arrested under the name """"Walter Currans"""" for the murder of his common law wife.

"""" Several days later"," a """"Walter Cairns"""" escaped from jail by sawing through the bars using a saw he hid in his shoe. """"As we pieced these stories together", the reports clearly suggested that Walter Cairns, (Walter Currans,) Charles Smith and Joseph Henry Loveless were all the same person, and that Agnes Loveless was murdered by her husband," the DNA Doe Project said. """"This was later confirmed by the Clark County Sheriff s Office via police records.

When he was 28, in 1899, Loveless married Harriett Jane Savage in Salt Lake City, Utah. Five years later, Harriett filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion and failure to support their child. A year after the divorce, Loveless married Agnes Octavia Caldwell in Bear Lake County, Idaho. They had four children together but Loveless wasn t the type to settle down. In 1914, he was arrested for bootlegging in Burley. A few months later he was again arrested for bootlegging in Burley but he managed to escape from jail and it wouldn t be the last time. In 1916, newspaper records show a man named Walter Garron pulled off a daring escape by cutting his jail cell s bars with a saw and then stopping a train. The news article is strangely worded but we assume he was being transported to jail on a train and somehow stopped the train in an attempt to escape it, Redgrave said. He was somehow caught and put in prison and escaped again anyway. Walter Garron was just one of the various aliases Loveless went by. Others included Walter Cairins, Curran, Currans, Cairns, Curnans and Charles Smith. On May 5,1916, Agnes Loveless was found dead in the tent she, Loveless and their 8 year old son lived in on the outskirts Dubois. Loveless was nowhere to be found and became the prime suspect. The problem was, he and his wife were using aliases at the time. The couple, both suspected bootleggers, were known in town as Charles and Ada Smith. This led to confusion among researchers about who killed Agnes and where Loveless was. They eventually came to the conclusion that Charles and Ada Smith were, in fact, Joseph and Agnes Loveless. On May 12,1916, the Pocatello Chronicle published an article titled Under Arrest on Murder Charge. Law enforcement had arrested a man they believed to be Walter Currans (Joseph Loveless) for Ada Smith s (Agnes Loveless) murder. Sheriff John Spencer of Fremont County in Spencer, Ida. , charged (him) with beating out his wife s brains. Her death resulted after 50 hours of intense agony. It is charged that the ax was wielded by her common law husband in Dubois at an early hour Saturday morning after she had returned home from a dance in that city, the article read. According to the news article, their 8 year old son found her and she had been beaten to death with an ax. At Agnes s funeral, one of their children was quoted as saying, Papa never stayed in jail very long and he ll soon be out. On May 23,1916, Loveless escaped from jail again by cutting the bars using a saw he had hidden in his shoes. After that, Loveless wasn t seen again until his headless, dismembered corpse was discovered in 1979. It s not clear who murdered Loveless, or how he was killed. There is a near certainty though that the murderer is also dead. Despite that, the Clark County Sheriff s Office plans to continue the investigation and hopefully discover who killed Loveless. This is one of the most exciting cases we have worked, forensic genealogist Lee Redgrave, Anthony Redgrave s wife said.  Corpse Found in Cave Verified as Outlaw from 100 Years Ago In the Civil Defense Caves near Dubois, Idaho, body parts were discovered there in 1979 and again in 1991, but the victim has remained unidentified until now. New research has led to the startling discovery that the man in question was actually a notorious outlaw who was last seen alive in 1916. When we think of outlaws on the run, we might assume that there would have been a far amount of disguises and fake names used, maybe some train cars jumped, as well as a few nights spent in caves or sleeping rough under trees. However, the outlaw in question here was placed in the caves after he was murdered. The caves were formed when lava running though rock created snaking caverns and are very well insulated because of the remaining volcanic rock. They got their name from the World War II supposition that they could be useful in providing shelter and/or storage during an invasion, but they were never used by the government or the military for such purposes. Instead, today the caves are a popular spot for hikers, though that wan t case nearly 100 years ago when the body was first hidden in the cave. The dismembered body was found wrapped in burlap, still wearing a blue and white striped shirt and a red sweater. Through DNA testing (and after many hours of genealogical research) a team of volunteer professionals have cracked the case of the John Doe in the cave. The body was found decapitated, but that didn t preclude finding out who he was. The volunteers work for a group called the DNA Doe Project, which aims to find out the identities of unidentified corpses. In all the identification process took around 2,000 hours and 15 weeks to complete on top of any initial investigations undertaken when the corpse was first found. The outlaw s name is Joseph Henry Loveless who was born in 1870 to parents emigrating West as part of the American expansion of the 19th century. Loveless parents were members of the Church of Latter Day Saints. Loveless first wife he married in Salt Lake City and they had one daughter before divorcing. His second wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, he married in Idaho and she bore him 4 children (although by some accounts they were common law spouses only). However, he went on to murder Agnes in 1916 after escaping from jail where he was being held for bootlegging and counterfeiting. Loveless was known to have kept a saw hidden in his shoes specifically so he could escape when caught. Agnes was killed with ax while 2 of her children were present in what is an extremely gruesome and twisted tale. At the time the man who killed her was said to be Charles Smith but when Loveless was arrested for the crime he was also using the name Walter Currans . After being arrested for Agnes murder, Loveless escaped yet again. During this stint as an outlaw, Loveless himself was murdered and dismembered and his body placed in the caves, probably also in 1916. His murderer remains unknown to this day, but it seems there is a pretty good chance that he was killed either to avenge Agnes murder or after a bootlegging deal gone awry. The polygamy and in marrying of early LDS church members made the genealogical research difficult, as did the spotty record keeping of the era. But, after sorting through potential victims, there was one possible descendant found whose DNA showed a match with the corpse. That descendant is Loveless 87 year old grandson. While no photographs of Loveless are known, a composite image has been created by Doe DNA based on photos of his parents. Loveless was in his 40s when he died. After the remains were found in 1979, the cold case became known as the Buffalo Cave Torso. One hand was later discovered by a young girl who was exploring the cave in 1991, and a subsequent search of the area yielded the remaining limbs, although Loveless head was never found. Learn more about this morbid and bizarre case in the video below.  Infamous Buffalo Cave Torso Identified, One of the Oldest Cases Resolved Using Forensic Genealogy Known as the Civil Defense Caves in Dubois, Idaho, the ancient lava tubes, once a valuable resource during the Cold War, have become a family excursion for exploring the easily accessible caves. In August of 1979, one family hunting for arrowheads in the caves, instead turned up a headless, burlap wrapped male torso. Local law enforcement had little to go on except that the torso was found outfitted in a dark red sweater. A little over a decade later, another youngster exploring the same cave came up with more burlap wrapped remains: two arms and two legs. Law enforcement brought in volunteers to search for a key component to the mystery, the head. Unfortunately, it was not found, and the case eventually went cold. The remains, which became known as the Buffalo Cave Torso, were examined by the FBI s elite forensic team with no resulting identification, and also examined at the Smithsonian, again without an identification being made. The case was eventually turned over to Idaho State University s anthropological researchers in cooperation with the Clark County Sheriff s Office. Dr. Amy Michael, at the University of New Hampshire and formerly of ISU, and Dr. Samantha Blatt at ISU reached out to Anthony Redgrave for help. Redgrave is a team leader at the DNA Doe Project and the lead forensic genealogist at Othram. With funding assistance from the DNA Doe Project, work began to see if DNA testing could reveal the identity of these remains. Othram s laboratory digitized the degraded remains from this case using Forensic Grade Genome Sequencing. Once the genetic data was generated, Redgrave and his team took over building a genetic genealogical tree and what happened next was a surprise to everyone. The Buffalo Cave Torso was not forty or so years old. It was an incredible 103 years old. In a press conference held on December 31, 2019 at the Clark County Community Center in Dubois, Idaho, the Clark County Sheriff s office announced the identity of the victim and expressed thanks to the team for enabling a positive identification. We can now confidently say that the torso found in the Civil Caves in 1979 belonged to Joseph Henry Loveless, born in Utah Territory in 1870, Anthony Redgrave commented. This is one of the oldest cases solved using autosomal DNA. We solved the case in about three and a half months after getting the DNA information back from the lab. Henry Loveless, born in 1870, and murdered in 1916, was a known bootlegger and counterfeiter. He had many encounters with the law and went by a number of aliases, including Walter Currans/Cairins, Cairns and Charles Smith. In May of 1916, he took an axe to his wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell and fled, wearing a maroon sweater under overalls. Having escaped jail numerous times with a saw kept secretly in his shoe, he eventually befell a grisly fate, not unlike that which he inflicted on his wife," in the depths of the Civil Defense Caves of Idaho.

DUBOIS," Idaho Investigators have finally put a name to a man whose dismembered body was discovered in a cave near Dubois decades ago. Forensic genealogy and DNA testing helped identify the so called """"Clark County John Doe"""" as Joseph Henry Loveless", who is believed to have been about 46 at the time of his death in 1916. Loveless' headless torso, wearing a dark red sweater and wrapped up in burlap, was found in the Idaho Civil Defense Caves by a family hunting for arrowheads in 1979. In 1991, a little girl exploring the same cave stumbled on more body parts, eventually leading to the recovery of Loveless' arms and legs. The then unidentified man's head was missing and has not been recovered, despite extensive searches by law enforcement. Loveless' remains were examined by both FBI forensic specialists and the Smithsonian in hopes of making an identification, without any luck. The case was ultimately handed over to Idaho State University's anthropological researchers, who worked with the Clark County Sheriff's Office and the DNA Doe Project. With funding from the DNA Doe Project, the investigators tried to determine whether DNA testing could help identify the dead man. The remains were digitized at the Othram Inc. laboratory in Texas, and forensic teams began working to build a genetic family tree they hoped could lead them to a name. It worked. The genealogy profile led to a living descendant of Loveless," whose DNA investigators also tested. The results came back as """"one to one match. """" That living descendant would be discovered to be Loveless' 87 year old grandson.

"""" Although law enforcement had originally believed the victim had been dead for about four decades", investigators instead learned that the man had been killed 103 years prior, making the case among the oldest to ever be solved with forensic genealogy. Loveless, who was born in 1870 in Payson, Utah was a bootlegger and counterfeiter who used aliases including Walter Currans, Walter Cairnes, and Charles Smith, among other names. He had repeated run ins with the law, and escaped from jail multiple times with a saw he kept hidden in his shoe. In May 1916, investigators learned, Loveless attacked his wife Agnes Octavia Caldwell with an axe, killing her. Loveless went on the run, wearing a maroon sweater and overalls, but did not make it far. All of this was confirmed through research and old police records. He was murdered and cut into pieces in the Civil Defense Caves that same year, investigators say. The man's killer or killers have not been identified, and it's unclear what the motive was behind his death. The Clark County Sheriff's Office said his death is considered an open homicide and detectives will continue to work on developments in the case, if possible. Although no photo was available of Loveless," the sheriff's office has released a composite created from photographs of his relatives and a physical description on his wanted poster.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. DUBOIS", Idaho Nobody could have guessed the identity of a man whose body was found in the Civil Defense Caves in 1979. For 40 years, anthropologists, scientists and investigators from Idaho State University all the way to the Smithsonian and the FBI tried to unravel the mystery of who this man was. The big question none of them could figure out was how long he had been in the caves. The answers were revealed Tuesday during a riveting news conference held by Clark County Sheriff Bart Mary and others involved in the decades long investigation. The man s remains were so well preserved, there was still skin on the body. Anthropologists believed that he had maybe only been in the caves for five to 10 years. When the DNA Doe Project finally put the genetic and genealogical pieces together, they learned he had been in the cave since 1916. Through our research, following the tireless experts of innumerable experts, we have identified Clark County John Doe. His name was Joseph Henry Loveless, DNA Doe Project team leader Anthony Redgrave said. Joseph Henry Loveless was born Dec. 3,1870, in Payson, Utah territory. Loveless was a notorious outlaw, bootlegger, jailbird and a vicious murderer, according to newspaper records from the era. The revelation that the man anthropologists believed had likely died sometime between 1969 and 1979 had actually died in 1916 was a shocking revelation. This definitely threw most anthropologists all anthropologists that looked at this (case), ISU anthropology department assistant professor Samantha Blatt said. Loveless s torso, arms and legs have been recovered, but his head has never been found. Researchers have not been able to uncover a photo of him either. Fortunately, the wanted poster published from when he murdered his wife has a description of what he looked like, although he was going by a different name at the time. Walt Cairns, age about 40 years, height about 5 ft. 8 or 9 in. , weight about 165 pounds, dark brown hair, slightly gray around ears, eyes bluish brown, medium complexion, has little or no eyebrows, small scar over right eye, tattoo of star on right hand between thumb and index finger, also tattoo of anchor same place on left hand he wore a light colored hat, brown coat, red sweater, blue overalls over black trousers, the poster reads. A composite of what Loveless may have looked like was created by combining images of his closest relatives and from written descriptions. The story of how scientists and historians identified Loveless is remarkable. Redgrave said this is now one of the oldest cases to be solved using DNA. Road to identification On Aug. 26,1979, a family was searching for arrowheads in a cave near the entrance of the Civil Defense Caves just north of Dubois. Instead of arrowheads, they found something else. Wrapped in burlap and buried in a shallow grave was the headless torso of a man. He was wearing a white shirt with blue pinstripes and a maroon sweater. He was also missing his arms and legs. Earl Holden, the Clark County Sheriff at the time, had the area searched for any other remains, but to no avail. He believed, based on the clothing the man was wearing, that he was likely a gambler from 60 years prior. Coroner Ernest Still performed an investigation and determined the man must have died within the last decade due to the presence of flesh and odor. Still wasn t the only one who thought that. In 1979, the top forensic anthropologist in the world, Dr. Doug Ubelaker from the Smithsonian Institute, believed the remains could have been anywhere from six months to ten years old. Already, at the beginning, no one could identify who this person was, ISU anthropology department assistant professor Samantha Blatt said. Twelve years later, an 11 year old girl was exploring the cave when she discovered a hand sticking out of the ground. An excavation led by Idaho State University and the Idaho Museum of Natural History uncovered the man s arms and legs. In 1997, the remains were transferred to the ISU Anthropology Department where they have remained ever since. In March 2019, Drs. Amy Michael and Samantha Blatt with the Idaho State University Anthropology Department decided to ask if DNA Doe Project would be willing to help try to identify the man in the cave. DNA Doe Project is a nonprofit organization that uses a methodology known as genetic genealogy to identify unknown individuals by using their DNA to find their family tree. Volunteers search through records and other sources to piece the individual s family history together until they are able to identify the person. Led by team leader Anthony Redgrave, 14 volunteer genealogists spent more than 2,000 hours researching Clark County John Doe s family tree. They found 31,730 individuals in the tree and narrowed their investigation down to 250 DNA cousins. Searching through those family trees, they tentatively identified the man as Joseph Henry Loveless. The genealogists discovered Loveless s parents were Latter day Saint pioneers from the Utah valley and were polygamists, which made DNA Doe Project s job much more difficult. Descendants of pioneers who have done their family history will know that their ancestors had many, many children often with several different spouses during the time period that polygamy was practiced, Redgrave said. He explained that often leads to intermarrying, which can affect the DNA in unpredictable ways. It also leads to half relationships or half cousins where two people only share DNA with one parent. Redgrave said that even though they had numerous close DNA matches, it was difficult to work with and narrow down to one individual. We took a lot of extra effort to confirm our potential identity over the course of several days, Redgrave said. Even then, Clark County Sheriff Bart May wanted to make extra sure the identity was correct. I felt like we needed to take it a step farther to make sure we were 100 percent correct. So we tracked down living relatives, which was really hard to do. But we found an 87 year old grandson who was willing to talk with us and meet with us and give us his DNA, May said. Through the grandson s DNA, authorities were able to confirm the remains did belong to Joseph Henry Loveless. This was an amazing case because watching it progress, it was so difficult because of the intermarriages and the Latter day Saints practice of polygamy. There were many, many complicated family relationships that we thought would take forever to untangle, DNA Doe Project Co founder Dr. Margaret Press said.

His name was Joseph Henry Loveless, DNA Doe Project team leader Anthony Redgrave said. Joseph Henry Loveless was born Dec. 3,1870, in Payson, Utah territory. Loveless was a notorious outlaw, bootlegger, jailbird and a vicious murderer, according to newspaper records from the era. The revelation that the man anthropologists believed had likely died sometime between 1969 and 1979 had actually died in 1916 was a shocking revelation. This definitely threw most anthropologists all anthropologists that looked at this (case), ISU anthropology department assistant professor Samantha Blatt said. Loveless s torso, arms and legs have been recovered, but his head has never been found. Researchers have not been able to uncover a photo of him either. Fortunately, the wanted poster published from when he murdered his wife has a description of what he looked like, although he was going by a different name at the time. Walt Cairns, age about 40 years, height about 5 ft. 8 or 9 in. , weight about 165 pounds, dark brown hair, slightly gray around ears, eyes bluish brown, medium complexion, has little or no eyebrows, small scar over right eye, tattoo of star on right hand between thumb and index finger, also tattoo of anchor same place on left hand he wore a light colored hat, brown coat, red sweater, blue overalls over black trousers, the poster reads. A composite of what Loveless may have looked like was created by combining images of his closest relatives and from written descriptions. The story of how scientists and historians identified Loveless is remarkable. Redgrave said this is now one of the oldest cases to be solved using DNA. Road to identification On Aug. 26,1979, a family was searching for arrowheads in a cave near the entrance of the Civil Defense Caves just north of Dubois. Instead of arrowheads, they found something else. Wrapped in burlap and buried in a shallow grave was the headless torso of a man. He was wearing a white shirt with blue pinstripes and a maroon sweater. He was also missing his arms and legs. Earl Holden, the Clark County Sheriff at the time, had the area searched for any other remains, but to no avail. He believed, based on the clothing the man was wearing, that he was likely a gambler from 60 years prior. Coroner Ernest Still performed an investigation and determined the man must have died within the last decade due to the presence of flesh and odor. Still wasn t the only one who thought that. In 1979, the top forensic anthropologist in the world, Dr. Doug Ubelaker from the Smithsonian Institute, believed the remains could have been anywhere from six months to ten years old. Already, at the beginning, no one could identify who this person was, ISU anthropology department assistant professor Samantha Blatt said. Twelve years later, an 11 year old girl was exploring the cave when she discovered a hand sticking out of the ground. An excavation led by Idaho State University and the Idaho Museum of Natural History uncovered the man s arms and legs. In 1997, the remains were transferred to the ISU Anthropology Department where they have remained ever since. In March 2019, Drs. Amy Michael and Samantha Blatt with the Idaho State University Anthropology Department decided to ask if DNA Doe Project would be willing to help try to identify the man in the cave. DNA Doe Project is a nonprofit organization that uses a methodology known as genetic genealogy to identify unknown individuals by using their DNA to find their family tree. Volunteers search through records and other sources to piece the individual s family history together until they are able to identify the person. Led by team leader Anthony Redgrave, 14 volunteer genealogists spent more than 2,000 hours researching Clark County John Doe s family tree. They found 31,730 individuals in the tree and narrowed their investigation down to 250 DNA cousins. Searching through those family trees, they tentatively identified the man as Joseph Henry Loveless. The genealogists discovered Loveless s parents were Latter day Saint pioneers from the Utah valley and were polygamists, which made DNA Doe Project s job much more difficult. Descendants of pioneers who have done their family history will know that their ancestors had many, many children often with several different spouses during the time period that polygamy was practiced, Redgrave said. He explained that often leads to intermarrying, which can affect the DNA in unpredictable ways. It also leads to half relationships or half cousins where two people only share DNA with one parent. Redgrave said that even though they had numerous close DNA matches, it was difficult to work with and narrow down to one individual. We took a lot of extra effort to confirm our potential identity over the course of several days, Redgrave said. Even then, Clark County Sheriff Bart May wanted to make extra sure the identity was correct. I felt like we needed to take it a step farther to make sure we were 100 percent correct. So we tracked down living relatives, which was really hard to do. But we found an 87 year old grandson who was willing to talk with us and meet with us and give us his DNA, May said. Through the grandson s DNA, authorities were able to confirm the remains did belong to Joseph Henry Loveless. This was an amazing case because watching it progress, it was so difficult because of the intermarriages and the Latter day Saints practice of polygamy. There were many, many complicated family relationships that we thought would take forever to untangle, DNA Doe Project Co founder Dr. Margaret Press said. The outlaw Finding out the body was Joseph Henry Loveless was one thing. Finding out details about his life was another. To do that, DNA Doe Project searched through eastern Idaho newspaper records. The man they discovered had a notorious reputation. Joseph Henry Loveless was born to Latter day Saint pioneers Joseph Jackson Loveless and Sarah Jane Scriggins. When he was 28, in 1899, Loveless married Harriett Jane Savage in Salt Lake City, Utah. Five years later, Harriett filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion and failure to support their child. A year after the divorce, Loveless married Agnes Octavia Caldwell in Bear Lake County, Idaho. They had four children together but Loveless wasn t the type to settle down. In 1914, he was arrested for bootlegging in Burley. A few months later he was again arrested for bootlegging in Burley but he managed to escape from jail and it wouldn t be the last time. In 1916, newspaper records show a man named Walter Garron pulled off a daring escape by cutting his jail cell s bars with a saw and then stopping a train. The news article is strangely worded but we assume he was being transported to jail on a train and somehow stopped the train in an attempt to escape it, Redgrave said. He was somehow caught and put in prison and escaped again anyway. Walter Garron was just one of the various aliases Loveless went by. Others included Walter Cairins, Curran, Currans, Cairns, Curnans and Charles Smith. On May 5,1916, Agnes Loveless was found dead in the tent she, Loveless and their 8 year old son lived in on the outskirts Dubois. Loveless was nowhere to be found and became the prime suspect. The problem was, he and his wife were using aliases at the time. The couple, both suspected bootleggers, were known in town as Charles and Ada Smith. This led to confusion among researchers about who killed Agnes and where Loveless was. They eventually came to the conclusion that Charles and Ada Smith were, in fact, Joseph and Agnes Loveless. On May 12,1916, the Pocatello Chronicle published an article titled Under Arrest on Murder Charge. Law enforcement had arrested a man they believed to be Walter Currans (Joseph Loveless) for Ada Smith s (Agnes Loveless) murder. Sheriff John Spencer of Fremont County in Spencer, Ida. , charged (him) with beating out his wife s brains. Her death resulted after 50 hours of intense agony. It is charged that the ax was wielded by her common law husband in Dubois at an early hour Saturday morning after she had returned home from a dance in that city, the article read. According to the news article, their 8 year old son found her and she had been beaten to death with an ax. At Agnes s funeral, one of their children was quoted as saying, Papa never stayed in jail very long and he ll soon be out. On May 23,1916, Loveless escaped from jail again by cutting the bars using a saw he had hidden in his shoes. After that, Loveless wasn t seen again until his headless, dismembered corpse was discovered in 1979. It s not clear who murdered Loveless, or how he was killed. There is a near certainty though that the murderer is also dead. Despite that, the Clark County Sheriff s Office plans to continue the investigation and hopefully discover who killed Loveless. This is one of the most exciting cases we have worked, forensic genealogist Lee Redgrave, Anthony Redgrave s wife said.  The Woodlands forensics lab helps ID killer slayed 103 years ago in Idaho Following the discovery of a torso in an Idaho cave 40 years ago, a forensics lab in The Woodlands recently helped authorities identify the remains of a man who murdered his wife and was himself killed more than a century ago. Joseph Henry Loveless, born in 1870 in the Utah Territory and murdered around 1916, was identified by genealogists at the nonprofit DNA Doe Project through the work done at Othram, a firm whose forensics lab is located off New Trails Drive. Othram digitized DNA extracted from Loveless remains, mapping it out in a process known as genome sequencing. This is the oldest or one of the oldest law enforcement cases using this technique, said Othram CEO David Mittelman. Genelogists working with the lab were able to make a match with Loveless, a bootlegger and counterfeiter, who escaped custody after being jailed for the May 1916 ax dismemberment of Agnes Octavia Caldwell, his second wife and the mother of his four children. RELATED: Can you help solve some of Houston's most infamous cold cases? Findings were released Dec. 31, making this is the first case Othram has worked on to be publicly disclosed. Benchmark moment The unraveling of Loveless sordid life and demise began in August 1979 when a family digging for arrowheads at the Civil Defense Caves in Dubois, Idaho found a burlap wrapped male torso. A little more than a decade later, the unidentified man s arms and legs were found in the same cave. Loveless head has yet to be recovered. Anthropological researchers at Idaho State University, working with Idaho s Clark County Sheriff s Office, got involved and reached out to Othram s lead forensic genealogist, Anthony Redgrave. He and wife Lee Bingham Redgrave, also an Othram forensic genealogist, work with the DNA DOE Project, which identifies remains through DNA data. Through funding from the DNA Doe Project, the Redgraves and their team built a genealogical tree using the genetic data from Othram s sequencing, which was achieved after DNA was extracted from a bone found within the cave remains. The sequenced DNA was digitized and an electronic file was then available for the Redgraves, who are based in Massachusetts, to cross reference with potential matches in genealogy databases. ON HOUSTON CHRONICLE. COM: Woodlands forensics lab uses human genome to solve crimes, ID people You can t ask a skeleton to spit in a tube. We have to go through this lengthy process of different lab steps to get the same kind of file that you would get if you spit into a tube and sent it in, Bingham Redgrave said. After three and a half months, they made a positive ID on Loveless. This is a benchmark moment for Othram, which has been operating since April. The FBI s forensic team s effort to identify the headless man yielded no results. The Smithsonian worked on the case and also came up short. It s one thing to kind of pitch the technical achievements that you can make in analyzing DNA, it s another to apply it to practice. That s why everyone s so excited about the case, Mittelman said. It really showcases the power of this advanced DNA testing. Othram is growing its client base, currently helping sequence the DNA of 95 black prison laborers buried in a Sugar Land cemetery. Mittelman is urging people to visit DNASolves. com, a website Othram launched in November, where DNA information can be shared to help solve more cases of unknown identity like the that of the headless man in the cave. Completing the puzzle Loveless lay hidden in the genealogy tree the Redgraves team was sketching out. To zero in on him, Bingham Redgrave explained the research team traced biolgocial family by finding multiple DNA matches with cousins of his, indicating ancestry from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints pioneers to Utah. Common ancestors is really the key puzzle pieces that you need to find in genetic genealogy, Bingham Redgraves said. The aha moment for researchers came when they realized a cemetery stone marker bearing Loveless name and birthday had no one buried under it likely a reserved spot in the family plot. The research team found Loveless wife had been killed with an ax and the man wanted for the killing had an alias Loveless commonly used. Existing arrest records corroborated all this. Furthermore, a newspaper article from the time stated Loveless escaped jail. Loveless was known for fleeing jail custody multiple times with the help of a saw he secretly kept in his shoe. ON HOUSTON CHRONICLE. COM: The Woodlands based Othram applies DNA sequencing to aid investigations Additionally, the torso found in the cave was outfitted in a dark red sweater and Loveless was reportedly wearing a maroon sweater under overalls when he escaped. DNA confirmation is usually done through the FBI s Combined DNA Index System. But it would only work with a full sibling, parent or child of Loveless, all of whom are no longer living. However, a living grandson of Loveless from his union with the wife he stood accused of butchering was located. The 87 year old had his DNA tested to affirm the genealogical findings. As satisfying as the confirmation was for the genealogists on the case, Bingham Redgrave understands the work is in service of bringing closure to others. It s somebody else s puzzle. Somebody has a mystery in their family. Somebody has a missing person. Some question marks that are in their family stories, she said. We always know we re working to solve it for somebody else. Untimely deaths Due to the multiple implements used to dismember him and the remote location where his body was disposed, authorities are confident Loveless was murdered and the case remains open until a suspect is determined. A leading theory the sheriff s office has pushed forth about Loveless death, Bingham Redgrave said, is he died through an act of retaliation for murdering his wife. SOLVED: La Porte man arrested in 1983 cold case murder of Conroe woman Likely part of the reason Loveless whereabouts were never questioned could be blamed on family lore. An obituary on his youngest daughter from his second marriage stated both he and his wife were slaughtered when a deranged Indian looking for gold attacked them in their tent home, Bingham Redgrave explained. Another element of strangeness to this Old West outlaw saga is that more than one person close to Loveless appears to have suffered an untimely death. The Redgraves team was able to find some accounts about Loveless and his brothers being involved in criminal activity, possibly moonshine production, when they were younger. One of Loveless brothers drowned in the Snake River in Utah, presumed a suicide and then ruled a homicide. Loveless was thought to have also drowned, but then showed up alive at his brother s funeral. And the first woman he married, it turned out, faced an unnatural end just as his second wife had. Bingham Redgrave said his first wife reportedly killed herself with lye," a metal hydroxide. jose. gonzalez chron. com twitter. com/jrgzztx""",44.1555249,-111.7780969,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. in fine art from Pitzer College, Claremont, and has practiced as a freelance illustrator for the, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Santa Barbara News Press and UCSB. After moving to the Santa Ynez Valley in 1989, Hedrick joined local Save the Sedgwick Ranch efforts to preserve the land from development. Inspired by the natural landscape and open spaces of the Santa Ynez Valley, Hedrick has dedicated her attention to the landscape with a particular interest in atmospheric effects, typically captured in pastel. She has exhibited at local museums and galleries, including individual and group shows at the Easton Gallery in Santa Barbara and Young s Gallery in Los Olivos, as well as a 2013 retrospective at the Elverh j Museum of History and Art in Solvang. Hodgson was born in Alberta, Canada, in 1956 and grew up in Santa Barbara. His love of birdwatching started at age 11, when he went on his first Audubon birdwatching trip. He later began sketching and painting birds and wildlife as part his lifelong study of birds, reptiles and mammals. Hodgson s career as a mechanical designer in the engineering field has honed his illustrative technique his precision and attention to detail is reflected in his painting style, which combines accurate detail with muted abstract backgrounds. He spends hours in the field drawing inspiration from actual experiences and encounters with his subjects. Hodgson uses field notes, sketches, and his own photography to compose his pieces in the studio. Careful attention is given to the authenticity of habitat and anatomy of his subjects. Hodgson believes it s imperative we protect our remaining wild lands and habitats to ensure rich biodiversity and ecological health of the planet. He hopes his paintings will help the viewer appreciate how much is at stake and motivate them to protect our environment. It would be such a loss for future generations to not know the beauty of these creatures, he said. Hodgson is a self taught painter and works primarily in oil on hand stretched linen canvas and custom frames each piece. His paintings hang in private homes and collections throughout the Western United States and Canada. For more, visit www. hodgsonfineart. com. Sonneman, who lives in Palo Alto, was born and raised in Winona, Minn. He briefly attended Northwestern University in Illinois before graduating from The San Francisco Art Institute in 1975.

Santa Barbara International Film Festival Recognizes Wildling Museum Documentary on Carrizo Plain Posted on January 2, 2020 9:00 a. m. Source: Lauren Sharp for Wildling Museum The Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) has announced the official selection of the Wildling Museum of Art and Nature s most recent film ""Carrizo Plain A Sense of Place. "" The short documentary film, produced as a companion piece to the museum s juried exhibition Celebrating the National Lands of California, is on display in the Wildling s main gallery through Jan. 19. ""Carrizo Plain A Sense of Place"" will screen at the 2020 SBIFF at 8 p. m. Saturday, Jan. 25, at the Arlington Theatre, 1317 State St. It s very exciting to have a film produced by the museum featured at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival and to share the story of Carrizo Plain National Monument with a wider audience, said Stacy Otte Demangate, Wildling Museum executive director. The Santa Barbara International Film Festival sets a high bar for inclusion and I m very honored to have 'Carrizo Plain A Sense of Place' make the cut for the 2020 SBIFF, said filmmaker Jeff McLoughlin, of Goodeye Films, who produced the 32 minute documentary for the Wildling Museum. ""Carrizo Plain A Sense of Place"" profiles San Luis Obispo County s Carrizo Plain National Monument. This pristine corner of Central Coasta is home to the highest concentration of endangered species in the state. The film reveals the unique qualities of the Carrizo Plain through the eyes of three artists Chris Chapman, Bill Dewey and John Iwerks. All three artists have significant bodies of work drawn from their individual artistic interpretations of the Carrizo Plain produced over three decades. Iwerks created key portions of the interpretive displays within the Goodwin Education Center at the National Monument, including a dramatic 18 foot mural that is the centerpiece of the monument s visitor center. The three artists are also members of Santa Barbara s Oak Group, a collective of artists dedicated to the preservation of natural places. The work of these artists, as profiled in the film, along with the cinematic experience the film provides is incredibly engaging, said Otte Demangate. Using art to foster appreciation for natural landscapes like the Carrizo Plain is at the core of the Wildling Museum s mission. The film s stunningly photographed visuals are the work of wildlife cinematographer Elliot Lowndes, whose work has appeared in natural history productions worldwide, including projects for BBC and National Geographic. In addition to its premier status as an internationally recognized venue for Academy Award qualifying films, the SBIFF is also a good outlet for independent filmmakers and the South Coast community, utilizing cinema to tell important stories. For a nonprofit such as the Wildling Museum, producing a short film like ""Carrizo Plain A Sense of Place"" is a means for sharing the museum s mission and drive community engagement. It s a fantastic documentary. I am very impressed and was totally engaged. I am looking forward to visiting Carrizo Plain this spring, said Michael Albright, SBIFF programming director. Film festival passes can be purchased online at www. sbiff. org. A trailer and more information about ""Carrizo Plain A Sense of Place"" can be viewed on the film s website www. carrizoplainfilm. com and the Wildling Museum website, www. wildlingmuseum. org/films. McLoughlin is a Santa Barbara based documentary filmmaker producing films that focus on the natural world, environmental issues, and art. His films have been official selections at natural history, wildlife, and conservation film festivals and have screened in museums and educational institutions nationwide.

Port of Virginia,"Amazon Buys 87 Acres Of Land In Southeastern Virginia SUFFOLK, Va. Online retail giant Amazon has bought 87 acres of land in southeastern Virginia. But the company isn t revealing why. The Virginian Pilot reported Monday that the company bought the land earlier this month in Suffolk. The city is near the Port of Virginia and already home to many warehouses that store coffee from other countries. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty confirmed the land purchase to the Pilot but would not provide details on its plans for the property. She said Amazon has a policy of not commenting on our future road map. She said, the purchase in Suffolk provides us with the flexibility to quickly respond to our future network needs. The newspaper reported in July that Amazon could be planning to build a 200 million multistory fulfillment center.  Marine Highway projects get $7.5 million in MARAD grants MARAD has announced the award of more than 7.5 million in grants to nine Marine Highway projects.

DuPont investing $75 million-plus at its Spruance plant in Chesterfield County DuPont is investing more than 75 million to modernize and expand its manufacturing and technology presence at the company s Spruance plant on Jefferson Davis Highway in Chesterfield County. The expansion will create about 60 new jobs over the next several years, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Tuesday afternoon. The plant employs more than 2,000 people and is one of the largest employers in Chesterfield. Neither the governor nor the company disclosed what product line is being expanded at the plant, which is the company s largest manufacturing site. DuPont has operated the plant since 1929. The plant currently produces Kevlar, Nomex and Tyvek. The investment will be going into multiple areas on the site, but we are not talking about specific areas right now, DuPont spokeswoman Debbie McNeil said. The expansion of the company s Spruance site in Chesterfield County is a significant win, and we are grateful to DuPont for their ongoing commitment to the commonwealth, Northam said in a statement. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with Chesterfield County and the Port of Virginia to secure the project for Virginia. DuPont has been a community supporter for 90 years, said Garrett Hart, Chesterfield s economic development director. The fact they ve committed to such an investment in this facility . we re delighted. Northam approved a 250,000 grant from the Commonwealth s Opportunity Fund to assist Chesterfield with the project. The governor also approved a performance based grant of 1 million from the Virginia Investment Performance program. DuPont also is eligible to receive sales and use tax exemptions on manufacturing equipment, as well as benefits from the Port of Virginia Economic and Infrastructure Development Zone Grant Program. The company also qualifies for other credits for creating new full time jobs, for having research and development expenses and for supporting training activities. It is satisfying to learn that part of the decision to reinvest in the commonwealth came as a result of the positive long term relationship that exists between the port and DuPont, as well as the incentives provided to the company, John Reinhart, CEO and executive director of the Virginia Port Authority, said in a statement. We are looking forward to many more years of serving as the international trade gateway for DuPont. David Johnson, the Spruance site manager for DuPont, said in a statement that the company has invested more than 250 million to upgrade and improve its manufacturing operations at the plant since 2015. In March 2018, for instance, DuPont announced it was investing 50 million in its global operations that make Kevlar because of strong demand. Kevlar is a high strength fiber best known for its use in bullet resistant vests worn by soldiers and law enforcement officers. The company did not disclose at the time how much of the 50 million would be invested specifically at the Spruance plant.

Northam delivers State of Commonwealth; Suetterlein gives GOP response Northam delivers State of Commonwealth Suetterlein gives GOP response By Governor Northam is urging Virginia lawmakers to continue moving the state forward and embrace changes statewide, including strengthening the economy and continuing to create jobs. In his State of the Commonwealth address on the General Assembly s opening day, Northam said increased spending on education will continue economic prosperity in Virginia. Roanoke County Republican State Senator David Suetterlein gave the GOP response, and he criticized Northam s budget, saying it would do more harm than good. WFIR s Clark Palmer has the story: Here is the text of Governor Northam s Address: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, happy New Year, and thank you for that warm welcome. To my wife Pam, Lieutenant Governor Fairfax, Attorney General Herring, Justices of the Supreme Court, newly elected members, returning colleagues, and my Cabinet and staff, thank you for your service to the Commonwealth. And good evening, Madam President and Madam Speaker. The Chamber looks pretty good from up here, doesn t it? It s a proud moment to look out and see a General Assembly that reflects, more than ever, the Virginia we see every day. This is truly an historic night. Just one week ago, we closed a decade that sometimes challenged our fundamental beliefs and even made us question what it means to live in a changing America. So tonight, let us recall some basic facts, because we have a lot to be thankful for and countless reasons for pride, hope, and optimism. Today, around the world, scientific advances mean people live longer than ever before. Capitalism enables more people to live in prosperity than ever. And democracy gives more people than ever before the opportunity to live in freedom, and shape their future. We should celebrate these amazing human achievements. Because today, we live at the greatest moment in the greatest state in the greatest country in human history. But if we re honest, it doesn t always feel that way. Our country is divided. People are angry left, right, center, urban, rural, men, women. Politics has grown too much about tearing each other down and too little about public service. And eight days into 2020, we know we have a long and painful election year ahead. We just closed out a decade that brought a lot of change. The pace of change can be disorienting and it s only getting faster. Ten short years ago, I had served in the Senate just a couple of years. I ve cherished the opportunity to serve, and I m thinking about that a lot tonight. But ten years ago, most of you were not here, especially in the House of Delegates. Everyone has a new role today. These new roles bring new responsibilities. The changes in this General Assembly reflect the changes in Virginia. Virginia has grown by 600,000 people since then. That s like adding a new Richmond and a new Virginia Beach, in just a decade. Ten short years ago, our country still reeled from the global economic collapse, brought on by Wall Street greed, and nearly 1 of every 10 Americans was out of work. Today, more people are working than ever before. Statewide unemployment has dropped to record lows. That s good, and we need to keep this momentum going. But wages haven t kept up. Too many people are under employed, and we can t ignore that fact. The stock market has soared over these ten years. So have home prices. That s good news if you re already doing well. But not if you re trying to. Many parts of Virginia have grown, as opportunity expands. Others have shrunk, as opportunity recedes. The climate is changing, and sea levels are rising. Just ask the Navy, the shipyard, our friends on Tangier Island, or anyone who lives or works in Hampton Roads. Virginia is changing. These are simply facts. In politics, over these past ten years, if you understood these facts, and you embraced change, then you advanced. If not, you fell behind. I have been really excited about tonight. What an amazing opportunity for everyone here, and everyone at home, to witness history. Tonight, after 400 years, the first women are leading this Joint Assembly. Let s all congratulate them! We celebrate this milestone, and we begin a new era. We spell that E R A! We serve the people, and they have been clear: They expect us to face Virginia s modern challenges and to lead the way forward, to make our shared home an even better place to live and work. Their expectations are really simple. Virginians want a well paying job and the chance to get ahead. They want their children to have a world class education. They want to be healthy. They want to live in a clean environment. They want to be treated fairly, and to participate in our civic life. They want to feel safe. And they want an inclusive Virginia, embracing diversity no matter the color of your skin, no matter what country you come from, what religion you practice, or who you love. I hear it all the time. This is the work they have sent us here to do, and this is our job for the next 60 days and beyond. And tonight, it s my job to lay out where we should go, and how we will get there. As a doctor, I swore an oath first, to do no harm. I ve learned that s a pretty good lesson for a public official too. We start by protecting people s money. This means building up financial reserves and preserving our AAA bond rating. This is really important because it makes everything we do easier, and less expensive. So I ve sent you a budget that boosts our financial reserves to 1.9 billion dollars. This is six times what we had in the bank when I came into office. Our savings were so low that a rating agency put us on credit watch. We were at risk of a downgrade. That would be bad. It s just like your own credit. If your score goes down, it s harder to borrow money to buy a car or fix up your house and it costs more too. A good credit rating is about saving money, and that s why it s so important. It s a critical tool to help us keep our economic momentum going. Our economic climate has brought Virginia one of the country s lowest unemployment rates, at 2.6%. It s rarely been this low in the technology era, and every region of Virginia is experiencing a lower unemployment rate than a year ago. Our economic climate brought Amazon to Northern Virginia, and I ve taken them to Southwest Virginia to encourage investment there as well. That project led to a plan to train 31,000 people in computer science all across Virginia. Our economic climate brought Morgan Olsen to Danville Pittsylania County, creating 700 manufacturing jobs. It brought AeroFarms there too, to build the world s largest and most sophisticated vertical farm. Agriculture remains the largest sector of Virginia s economy, and it s changing fast too. I spend a lot of time listening to entrepreneurs around the country and around the world. They all tell me: We want to do business in Virginia. We need businesses to keep saying that. We also know that the race for talent is on. Low unemployment means competition for workers. But just because you have a job doesn t always mean you can survive on it. The people who are building our economy should benefit from it too. The companies that recognize this will get ahead. So let s work together to raise the minimum wage. Let s work together to help companies properly distinguish between contractors and employees. This will help workers get the fair treatment and benefits they deserve. And let s always remember that good conditions for workers depend on a strong economy and a strong business climate. That s how healthy and prosperous states generate the revenue to invest in safe streets, public education, good transportation networks, and more. As you drove to Richmond for this session, you saw numerous road projects underway all over Virginia improvements of I 81, I 64, 95 395, to name just a few. The Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel is being expanded, and we re moving forward on two new bridges across the Potomac River one for cars trucks, the other for trains. This is a once in a generation opportunity to make our rail system work better for commuters and passengers, across all of Virginia, throughout the southeast and along the entire East Coast. We re modernizing the Port of Virginia, to make it the deepest on the Atlantic Coast, so it can welcome the world s largest ships, and export our goods to every corner of the globe. I thank you for supporting investments in this important infrastructure, because transit systems, bridges, and roads enable Virginia to compete in a fast changing global economy. We have to invest to remain competitive. It s no secret that the current way we fund transportation is simply not sustainable. States across the country are dealing with this. Clearly, it s good that people are burning less gas driving cleaner and more efficient cars. But that means revenues are dropping, while transportation costs are rising. We need to reform transportation funding this session, and start to make new investments in transit to help commuters and low income people get to work. We also need to invest in broadband. Because the changing economy is about much more than moving people and goods it s also about moving information. Broadband has become an economic necessity for business, for education, for healthcare, and for everyday life. So I ve sent you a budget that invests 35 million each year to get more communities connected. I ask you to pass it. A changing economy requires us to think about education in new ways. In the past, we thought of early childhood education merely as babysitting. But today, research shows that learning starts much earlier than we used to believe. The experiences children have in their earliest years lead to lifelong results. As a pediatric neurologist, and a parent, I know that learning needs to start earlier. So I have sent you a comprehensive plan for early childhood education. This plan will invest 95 million new dollars to help at risk three and four year olds start learning sooner. This means training educators, providing support, and setting accountability standards. I m grateful to the First Lady for bringing together the early childhood community parents, providers, the business community and more. They all know: If we invest in little learners today, we ll see great results for adults tomorrow. Other states have done this, and it s time for Virginia to get moving. Then, we need to invest in our K 12 public schools with teacher raises, more guidance counselors, and extra funds for high need schools. This budget increases the At Risk Add On for educationally at risk students, by 140 million. This is the largest single increase to this funding source in Virginia s history, and it s a critical investment in helping raise student achievement. An investment in public schools is an investment in students and our economy. That s why it s so important. In fact, education represents 38% of the new spending in this budget. This is far and away the largest new investment we have proposed. Then, after high school, people need to get job skills. There s lots of ways to do this, from registered apprenticeship programs to Virginia s community colleges. They understand what employers need, and everyone can get to them. They re nimble, and they re changing fast to meet the needs of employers. A changing economy requires us to think about their students in new ways too. In the past, when people finished high school, then got a job or started a family, and then went back, we called them non traditional students. But today, that describes a lot more students than ever. And many of them face two big barriers to getting advanced education the cost, and life itself. Here s an example. At Reynolds Community College here in Richmond, a majority of students are people of color. The college looked at retention rates who starts a degree program and then goes on to complete it. They identified students who started one academic year and didn t come back the next. They asked why didn t these students come back? The answer is really important. The facts showed it was not academics that kept them from coming back. In fact, these students usually had earned a 3.1 grade point average when they left school. Let that sink in for a minute. These students enrolled in a degree program trying to get a skill, so they can get a job, and provide for the people they love. They set a goal. They worked hard. They performed well, but dropped out. Why? They left because life got in the way. The car broke down. Or the baby got sick. Or they lost their job. Just trying to get ahead. And then life hits you. If you re that person, and life gets in the way, you re out of luck. That breaks my heart. Here s the good news: Reynolds found ways to help, and now Virginia needs to help too. So I m sending you a proposal to help people Get Skilled, Get a Job, and Give Back. We call it G 3. We ll make a deal with people trying to get ahead. If you need help, and if you choose to go into a high demand field like health care, early childhood education, IT, public safety, or the skilled trades and if you commit to community service, then Virginia will cover your tuition, fees, and books. And if Pell grants already do that, we ll give you a stipend 1,000 a semester to help with transportation, child care, the rent, or even food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To help with life. That s a small amount for the Commonwealth, but it can build you a future you never thought possible. In return, and hundreds of companies that need workers, and too many places where too many people are stuck in poverty, especially in urban and rural Virginia. I intend to keep the classroom to career pipeline open and to keep our economic momentum going. So let s work together to help people get skilled, get a job, and give back. That s just one way we are making it easier to go to college. We are also increasing funding to make public colleges more affordable for students. We are increasing the Tuition Assistance Grants that make private colleges more affordable for Virginia students. We re making it easier for DREAMers to attend college and get ahead, with in state tuition. We are increasing higher education grants for veterans and the National Guard. This is an important way to honor their service, especially now as tensions rise in the Middle East. We re also increasing funding for Virginia s two public historically black colleges and universities. They play a critical role in training our workforce, and these funds will help bring them more in line with other universities. Please welcome President Abdullah of Virginia State, and President Adams Gaston of Norfolk State, who are with us in the gallery tonight. I want us to also work together to make sure that people have a roof over their heads. Affordable housing helps attract jobs and build thriving communities. But this basic necessity is out of reach for too many people, especially in a strong economy. So I m proposing to triple the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, which works to increase affordable housing and keep people from experiencing homelessness. We re also proposing a new program to help reduce evictions. It changes everything when you have a safe place to come home to every night. I saw that recently, when I met Ms. Karen Harris in Richmond. She had been without a place to live for more than 20 years. Living on the streets. She told me, It feels like there s no hope. That no one cares. Then, three years ago, she got a place to live. A group called Virginia Supportive Housing helped her find it. They help people in lots of ways, from managing their health needs to filling out paperwork. It s a great program. They demonstrate that the best way to make sure people have a roof over their head is to put a roof over their head. And guess what happened when she got a safe place to live? Her physical health improved. Her mental health improved. The fear is gone. She s working. She s learning new things, and she s giving back. Her life has literally been transformed. She told me, I don t have to just exist in this world anymore. Now, I have a chance to live. You want to know why this affordable housing proposal is so important? Look up there and see the big smile on Ms. Harris s face. Please help me welcome her to the gallery. Now, let s turn to health care. None of us wants to worry about it not even a physician. We all want it to be more affordable and easier to understand. For years, folks tried to expand Medicaid in Virginia. We got it done together. Today,375,000 more Virginians now have access to care. That s good news, and now there is more to do. I ask you to pass the healthcare equity budget I sent you last month. It looks like this. Do you want to see new mothers get more home visits? Should new mothers get access to care for a year after their baby is born? This budget does that. Do you want to find a way to cover doula programs in the community? Do you want to help reduce maternal mortality, particularly among women of color? Do you want more sickle cell services, and more health care workers in communities with high needs? This budget does all that. Do you want more behavioral health care and community services? Do you want military service members and veterans to have better access to health care? This budget does that too. This is the first time Virginia has invested in all this, in a serious way. This is the right thing to do for people, as we shape a Virginia that represents everyone. This also has real economic outcomes. When people are healthy, they can work and contribute to our economy. That s good for everyone. I also ask you to take three more actions to make health care easier and more affordable. First, I am sending you legislation to create a state run marketplace. This will help people who buy insurance on their own. The federal government runs the current system, and it isn t working. Virginia can do it better ourselves, and save money too. Second, I ask you to create a reinsurance program. That helps insurers cover high need people. It helps keep premiums low. The federal system used to have one, but it ran out so premiums went up. We ll adjust the cigarette tax to pay for it. Let s be clear it will still be lower than every neighboring state but one. And then, it s time to end the laws that restrict a woman s right to direct her own health care. Virginia has put these in place over the past 20 years or so. They re not about health care. They are about injecting politics and the government into the relationship between a woman and her physician. You don t have to be a doctor to know that s bad medicine. No more will legislators in Richmond most of whom are men be telling women what they should and should not be doing with their bodies. It s time to overturn these laws. Another thing that s important for our future is investing in our natural environment. I grew up on the Chesapeake Bay, and I value stewardship of our natural resources. This responsibility goes back to the earliest days, when our Creator charged us to care for the fish of the sea and the birds of the air. I ve seen how fragile our natural resources can be. I ve seen over and over again how a clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand. So we made this a priority from the beginning, and we have accomplished a lot, starting with combatting climate change. I set a clear goal: To have 3,000 megawatts of renewable energy solar and wind under way during my term, and up to 2,500 megawatts from off shore wind soon after. That s enough to power more than a million homes. We aim to have 30 percent of Virginia s electricity come from renewable sources in this next decade, and to make it 100 percent carbon free by 2050. We re on track to achieve this clean energy goal. And know this: We ll get there sooner if technology advances faster, and if we can keep rates affordable. I m pushing the energy companies to do just that. We re leading by example. Last fall, we signed the country s largest contract to buy renewable energy to power state government. We re finally joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, called RGGI. We re replacing old diesel school buses with new electric ones. We dedicated 20 million from the Volkswagen environmental settlement to super charge the effort. In Botetourt, Virginia s first on shore wind project is now moving forward, and we have broken ground on the first off shore wind project, about 30 miles off of Virginia Beach. Now, it s time to super charge that too. So I have sent you plans to create a new Office of Offshore Wind. I ask you to do this, so Virginia can lead in clean energy. Here s why this is so important: That off shore wind project will be enormous. The turbines are huge. They are taller than the Statue of Liberty. So you can t build them in some far off factory, put the blades on a truck and drive them over. They re just too big. It s best to build them close by, then send them out to sea. Here s what s so exciting: This means thousands of advanced manufacturing jobs for Hampton Roads. This will create an entire new clean energy industry here in Virginia. It will expand supply chain and logistics opportunities. But we have to invest to make it happen. So I ask you to approve up to 40 million to upgrade the Portsmouth Marine Terminal to get it ready. This is good for the environment and it s good for our economy too. So if you believe in clean energy, if you want to see American manufacturing jobs right here in Virginia, jobs that will supply parts for offshore wind up and down the East Coast, then I ask you to pass this budget. Clean energy is just one of many ways we aim to protect Virginia s natural resources. Our budget protects open space by tripling our current investment in land preservation. It includes major new clean water funding. These investments will help local governments tackle stormwater pollution and upgrade wastewater treatment plants. They will help farmers reduce runoff and implement best management practices in conservation. They will help restore oyster reefs in the Chesapeake Bay, because a single oyster can filter 50 gallons of water a day plus they re good to eat and good for you. All together, our investments in clean water total more than 400 million, and they will put Virginia on track to meet our obligation to clean the Bay by the 2025 deadline. We want other Chesapeake Bay states to look to Virginia as the clean water leader. Let s get it done together. Soon after taking office, I ordered the Department of Environmental Quality to modernize outdated regulations, strengthen enforcement, identify reasons for delays in permitting, and improve transparency. These were the first steps in restoring a critical agency that had been cut by 30 percent over the past decade. We need to keep making progress. So this budget includes new funding to help DEQ better protect the environment. A major portion is dedicated to community outreach, and it s time to create a permanent Environmental Justice Council. This is about addressing community issues up front. It s about transparency in decision making, when projects might affect a neighborhood, or historic lands. It s the right thing to do, and I ask you to support it. In all of our work, we strive to treat people fairly, and to make it easier to participate in our civic life. Basic fairness and equity are the foundation of our legislative agenda for this session. If we are going to move forward as a Commonwealth, we must take an honest look at our past. We know that racial discrimination is rooted in many of the laws that have governed our Commonwealth. So we convened a Commission to examine overtly discriminatory language that s still on our books. These include laws banning school integration, prohibiting black and white Virginians from living in the same neighborhoods, and prohibiting people from getting married unless they re the same race. These words remain enshrined in law, even as many of the Acts have been overturned. Words matter. They represent who we are and what we value. Actions matter too. So it s time to remove these words from Virginia s books. Then, we will pass comprehensive protections in employment, housing, and public accommodations for LGBTQ people. These are important steps toward building a more equal, just, and inclusive state. We need to make it easier for people to participate in their government. There s no more fundamental way to do that, than to vote. But in recent years, Virginia has steadily added more restrictions on voting. This infringes on our most basic civil right as Americans. We need to make it easier to vote, not harder. So we should do two things. One, no excuses required to vote absentee. The government shouldn t have to okay your reason for needing to vote early. And then, we need to make Election Day a holiday. We can do it by ending the Lee Jackson holiday that Virginia holds a week from Friday. It commemorates a lost cause. It s time to move on. And while we re at it, we need to let localities decide what to do with the Confederate monuments in their community. They know the right thing to do. We also need to take an honest look at our criminal justice system, to make sure we re treating people fairly and using taxpayer dollars wisely. For lots of historical reasons, our criminal justice system doesn t provide a second chance. If you make a mistake at a young age, and even if you pay your debt to society, your punishment too often follows you throughout your life. Now make no mistake if you commit a crime, there will be consequences. That can t change, and it won t. But the punishment must fit the crime. Not every offense deserves a life sentence. It s time to temper justice with mercy. Remember this is a bipartisan issue. Lots of Republican led states have reformed their criminal justice systems. It s time for Virginia to do it too. This means de criminalizing marijuana possession and clearing the records of people who ve gotten in trouble for it. It means making permanent the temporary policy you passed last year the one that says no more suspended drivers licenses, just because you owe court fines. If you can t drive, how can you get to work to earn the money to pay those fines? This temporary policy is working. Let s make it permanent. Criminal justice reform includes reforming parole. If offenders are older, or terminally ill, and they ve paid their debt to society, and they re no longer a threat what s the benefit in keeping them from being eligible for parole? Our criminal justice reform package funds more public defenders, including the first public defender office in Prince William. It provides support to returning citizens, and funding to speed up reviews of requests for pardons. This is about simple justice and fairness. When you ve paid your debt, we should welcome you back, encourage you to participate in civil society, and restore your right to vote. The data show that, and it s just the right thing to do. Lastly, let s turn to gun safety. I know this is a deeply emotional issue. Let s focus on facts. You all know the issue, and so do the voters. Because this is not new. Last summer, after the terrible shooting in Virginia Beach, I called the previous General Assembly into special session to take immediate action. I proposed eight common sense measures, designed to keep firearms away from dangerous persons. But there was no action. The measures I proposed did not receive a hearing. Virginians watched. They saw what happened, and they were appalled. So they changed the legislature. And here we are. This issue generates great emotion. But the facts are the facts, and I want Virginians to know the facts. Gun violence takes the lives of more than one thousand Virginians every year. Three people every day. At that rate, everyone on the floor of this Chamber would be gone by March. These are mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, friends, and little children. Virginians have had enough of the vigils and the funerals, enough of the mourning. They made that clear at the ballot box. So we are back, with eight common sense measures to keep dangerous persons away from firearms. If you have demonstrated extreme risk of violence, or there s a protective order against you, you shouldn t have a firearm. This means universal background checks. If there s nothing in your record, you have nothing to worry about. Let s be clear. This is all fully consistent with the Second Amendment. Every one of these proposals has passed constitutional muster. Other states have passed them into law. They were drafted by your own attorneys at Legislative Services, and teams of lawyers have reviewed them. It s clear that a majority of Virginians support these measures, and so do a majority of you. Many of you ran on common sense gun safety, on both sides of the aisle. I know that thoughts and prayers are important and well intended, after an act of violence. But Virginians spoke in November, and they expect votes and laws to make Virginia safer. As this discussion begins, let s have an honest conversation based on fact, not fear. We will engage in civil dialogue. I ask all Virginians to refrain from promoting fear and intimidation. I want to reiterate: This common sense legislation does not violate the Second Amendment. No one is calling out the National Guard. No one is cutting off your electricity, or turning off the Internet. No one is going door to door to confiscate guns. These laws are intended to keep Virginians safe. Period. It s time to act. On Monday, it will be two years since I stood on the steps of this Capitol and swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Virginia. I take this oath seriously. Every night, when I go to bed, I ask myself, How well did I do today? How well did I serve Virginia? And when I m down, and yes I m human too, I search for new ways to carry out my responsibilities. Believe me, I ve found some over the past year. A few things sometimes keep me up at night. I worry that our country is too polarized, and that we might not get past it. I worry that too many people believe there s not a place for them in our democracy. I worry that a child born a decade ago, looks at our country s politics today, and thinks this is normal. I want that 10 year old to know how wrong that is. I want her to know that we are bigger than this. We all have a lot to do to change America s politics. And this country once again looks to Virginia for leadership. It s easy to see why. In Virginia, we protect the people s money. We balance our budget. Washington hasn t done that in a generation. In Virginia, we save money. We put it in the bank for a rainy day. In Washington, they ve run up the national debt above 23 trillion dollars. One day, that bill will come due, and it s going to cost us all. And in Virginia, we treat each other with respect. We know that nasty tweets and name calling are wrong. We would punish our children if they acted that way, and we should be sick of it. I think we all want to live in a country where we d be proud if our young child can look to our country s leaders and say, I want to be like that person when I grow up. We don t have that now. But we can get it back, and we must. Tonight, to everyone who took the oath of office today, I say congratulations. And I ask you to remember: We all represent everyone who lives in this great Commonwealth. Family, friend, and foe alike. Whether we know them, or whether we like them. Even if you never met them, or visit the place where they live. That s not easy. It calls us to reach out of ourselves, to be larger, to be generous of heart. To be forgiving, and to treat each other as we would like to be treated. I learned that lesson from my mother. When I was a kid, she taught children who were learning English as their second language how to read. She worked in health care, nursing sick people back to health on Virginia s Eastern Shore. She volunteered with the hospice, comforting people in their final hours. She taught me that, no matter who we are or where we come from, we are all equal in the beginning and in the end. I ve thought of that many times since I ve had this job. That lesson comforts me, especially as I take on a great responsibility, like the one that you and I begin together tonight. Tonight, I ve presented an agenda that is different from every previous General Assembly session. It s a lot bolder, and it s more forward looking than ever before. I m here as your Governor because I m a builder, and I hope you will choose to build too. Let s build Virginia s future together. I know it will not be easy. Nothing that matters is. I also know this: Our hardest days are behind us, and our greatest days ahead. In America, we love a new beginning. As I look around this room, I see 140 people that I m eager to work with. Some I ve known for a long time. Others I m just getting to know. Everyone in a new role. I know you love Virginia, and I do too. I was born and raised here. Pam and I chose to raise our family here, and we intend to live the rest of our lives here. We ve got a lot to do for the people of Virginia. And when we do it right, treating each other with respect and decency, Virginia will once again show the country how to lead. I can t imagine a more noble mission, or anyone I d rather take it on with. I m grateful to the Virginians who stand together, and who encourage me every day. On behalf of Virginia, thank you all for your willingness to serve and to your families for supporting what you do. Let s make Virginia proud. May God bless you, may God bless Virginia, and may God bless the greatest country in the world. Delegate Roxann L. Robinson (R Chesterfield) and Senator David R. Suetterlein (R Roanoke County) delivered the Republican response. Here is the full text of their remarks: Senator Suetterlein Good evening, I m Senator David Suetterlein from Roanoke County. Delegate Robinson And I m Delegate Roxann Robinson from Chesterfield County. We re here tonight to share the Republican perspective on the state of our Commonwealth, and to share our views on this year s General Assembly session. Earlier today, Republicans and Democrats came together to officially begin the 2020 session of the Virginia General Assembly, with a day of historic firsts. For the first time in Virginia s history, a woman was elected Speaker of the House of Delegates, and a woman will serve as Majority Leader of the House of Delegates. Regardless of party, today is a day all Virginians can be proud of. And while we Republicans are disappointed to see our two decades in the majority come to an end, we re proud of the Commonwealth we leave to our Democratic successors. Starting today, they inherit a dynamic and growing economy, with unparalleled opportunity for Virginians of all walks of life. Thanks to more than two decades of Republican governance, our Commonwealth has collected accolade after accolade: Virginia is the best state in the nation for business We have the fourth best schools in the nation The second safest schools in the nation The second lowest crime rate The lowest criminal recidivism rate Virginia has a Triple A bond rating, one of only a handful in the nation and A Rainy Day Fund of more than 1 billion, a hedge against economic uncertainty and Student tuition is frozen at all public universities in the Commonwealth for the first time in decades. For 20 years, General Assembly Republicans have governed with common sense principles, focusing on the over 8 million hard working people who make Virginia what it is. Just last year, Republicans not only managed to balance our budget without raising taxes, we did so while giving teachers a 5 percent raise, cutting taxes by more than one billion dollars, and making record investments in the priorities that Virginians care about. Our Commonwealth isn t perfect, but thousands of people vote with their feet each year they move here, start families here, and find careers here. We are blessed to live in a Commonwealth of opportunity. Truly, Virginia is the best place in our country to live, work, and raise a family. Republicans are rightly proud of this legacy, and we wish our Democratic colleagues the best and hope that they will build upon, rather than reverse, this hard won success. While we are hopeful, we are deeply concerned at early signs that they may indeed reverse course. Bills have been filed that would undo more than 50 years of Virginia labor law. Others would add onerous burdens to Virginia businesses, imposing crippling government mandates on the small businesses that drive our economy. We will work with Democrats where we can to preserve and improve every facet of life in Virginia. It is our sincere hope that Democrats will continue the policies that have served Virginia well for the past two decades. Senator Suetterlein The voters of Virginia have given Democrats control of state government for the first time in over a quarter century. We respect that result. Republicans are committed to working in the best interests of those who entrusted us to stand up for Virginia values, to defend innocent human life, to protect the rights of all Virginians, and to ensure the continued prosperity of the Commonwealth. Some of the proposals being advanced by Governor Northam and the Democrat legislative majority will have a profoundly negative effect on Virginia s working families. If implemented, the Democrats agenda will place a substantial burden on working Virginians. Specifically, the Democrats proposals will: Raise electric bills, making it more expensive for you to live in your home Raise fuel prices, making your daily commute to work more expensive and Raise taxes, taking more of your hard earned money. Disappointingly, the budget submitted by the Governor has substantial spending increases, yet doesn t include a pay increase for our hard working teachers this year. Even when the Governor does propose a cost savings to Virginians, with his plan to have Virginia join the 36 states that do not require mandatory car inspections, the savings would be more than offset by his proposed substantial increase in fuel taxes. This will disproportionately hurt working Virginians. The Governor and Democrats sweeping proposals to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law abiding Virginians has led many localities to preemptively act to protect those rights. Republicans will continue to defend the Constitutional rights of all law abiding Virginians. There are some areas where many Republicans concur with Governor Northam s proposals. Republicans like me stand ready to work with the Governor on Criminal Justice reforms like ending the suspension of drivers licenses because of unpaid court fees a practice that makes it difficult for people to go to work and more likely to be dependent on taxpayer supported social services. But, Republicans will also stand with the victims of crimes and for truth in sentencing, ensuring that Virginia s jury findings are upheld. Virginia has been blessed with both natural resources and natural beauty. From the Cumberland Gap to the Chesapeake Bay to the Blue Ridge, our commonwealth is an extraordinary place. Republicans stand ready to work to ensure all Virginians have a state government that puts their interests first. On behalf of Delegate Robinson and myself, thank you for watching.  Nine Projects Receive Marine Highway Grants New Paducah Baton Rouge Project To Receive 480,000 Grant money from the Maritime Administration s America s Marine Highway Program will help fund more than 7.5 million for nine projects, including one between Paducah, Ky. , and Baton Rouge, La. The Paducah McCracken Container on Barge Marine Highway Project was awarded 480,000 as part of a new project connecting the two areas, MarAd announced January 6. Paducah McCracken County Riverport Authority Executive Director Bill Miller said he was excited for the port to be recognized as a grant recipient. It will enable the port to work with an unnamed transportation partner, taking the first steps toward obtaining equipment necessary to begin regularly scheduled container on barge service, he said. We intend to investigate to make sure we are using the money in the best manner for positive results, Miller said. Sign up for Waterway Journal's weekly newsletter. Our weekly newsletter delivers the latest inland marine news straight to your inbox including breaking news, our exclusive columns and much more. Your Email Email Address Subscribe MarAd said the money would be used to support the purchase or lease of equipment at a Baton Rouge facility that will be used to load and unload containers. The service will be centrally located near the confluence of major inland waterways and connect to the international export ports of Louisiana, according to MarAd. Miller declined to release specifics, although he said he expected more information to be available soon. Speaking in general terms, Miller said container on barge service has a lot of positive economic and environmental benefits. The process allows barges to transport shipping containers filled with goods or raw materials to and from domestic and international ports. Using the service will expand shipping options for the country s heartland, he said. Container on barge is a lower cost way to move products between regionally operating companies and international markets without the dangers of land based shipping as well as the wear and tear on highways when such products are shipped by truck, Miller said, adding, It s something we can do safely, efficiently and in an environmentally friendly way to move freight along the inland waters. U. S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao termed the grants an investment in MarAd s news release announcing recipients. This 7.5 million investment will improve our country s vital fuel efficient waterway transportation system, which makes an important contribution to exports and economic growth, she said. The America s Marine Highway Program supports the increased use of the nation s navigable waterways to relieve traffic congestion, provide new and efficient transportation options and increase the productivity of the surface transportation system, MarAd said. The America s Marine Highway Program is dedicated to expanding the use of our inland waterways for freight movement, Maritime Administrator Mark H. Buzby said. This round of grant funding will be used to continue that expansion and ensure that our waterways are used effectively. The American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) lauded the announcement. This program is an asset that enables ports and port communities to fully realize their potential in managing increasing freight volumes while reducing traffic congestion, said AAPA President and CEO Chris Connor. Other projects funded in the grant program were: Baton Rouge New Orleans Shuttle of the M 55. Awarded 1,40,0, sponsored by SEACOR AMH. The grant will buy six purpose built barges and lease a towboat to support the Port Allen to New Orleans container shuttle. Houston Gateway and Gulf Container on Barge Central Node. Awarded 180,0, sponsored by the Port of Houston Authority. The grant will help to fund planning and a study to provide the data necessary to establish a business case to support shipping container movements by barge between terminals. M 95 Fernandina Express Container on Barge Service. Awarded 1,291,800, sponsored by the Ocean Highway and Port Authority of Nassau County. The grant will support the purchase of marine terminal handling equipment for the loading and unloading of the Fernandina Express container barge service between Fernandina, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina. MARAD said the service has potential for growth and the creation of an estimated 110 jobs. Lake Erie Shuttle. Awarded 1,101,735, sponsored by the Port of Monroe, Michigan. The grant will help with the purchase and installation of a crawler crane and training for it. Port of Morrow M 84 Barge Service Expansion. Awarded 1,623,200, sponsored by the Port of Morrow, Oregon. The grant will be used to support the expansion of barge services from Morrow to Portland, Oregon Vancouver, Washington and Longview, Washington including the enhancement of two marine terminals. James River Expansion Project. Awarded 189,840, sponsored by the Port of Virginia. The grant will be used to buy equipment in support of the existing James River Expansion Project on M 64. The equipment will help the Richmond Marine Terminal provide more efficient barge service operation to current and potential customers. Wallops Island M 95 Intermodal Barge Service. Awarded 96,425, sponsored by the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority. The grant will be used to design a new trestle and combination dock/ramp to support the loading and unloading of barges and research vessels at the Mid Atlantic Regional Spaceport. Seattle Bainbridge Island Ferry Service. Awarded 1.5 million, sponsored by the Washington State Ferries. The grant will help convert one of the two ferries used in the Seattle Bainbridge Island Ferry Service from diesel to hybrid, reducing emissions.

(Photo courtesy of Paducah McCracken County Riverport Authority) Retail Imports Settling Down After Year Of Tariff Surges WASHINGTON January 10, 2020 After a year of fluctuations driven by the uncertainty of the trade war with China, volume at the nation s major retail container ports is expected to return to its usual seasonal patterns during the first few months of 2020, according to the Global Port Tracker report released today by the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates. We ll be more confident after we see the Phase One agreement signed, but right now 2020 looks like it should be back to what used to be normal, NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. We ve been through a cycle of imports surging ahead of expected tariff increases some of which got delayed, reduced or canceled and falling off again afterward. That s not good for retailers trying to manage their inventory levels or trying to make long term business plans. And tariffs are never good for consumers, businesses or the economy. It is not surprising that even the Federal Reserve suggests that the impact of the trade war has a negative impact on the U. S. economy, Hackett Associates Founder Ben Hackett said, citing recent government data on declines in industrial production and increases in inventory to sales ratios. This combination of reduced output counterbalanced by increased inventory underlies the uncertainties of the tariff wars. President Trump is scheduled to sign a Phase One partial trade deal with China on Wednesday. In announcing the deal, the administration said it would lower tariffs that took effect in September and canceled another round that was set to take effect December 15, but others remain in effect. U. S. ports covered by Global Port Tracker handled 1.67 million Twenty Foot Equivalent Units in November, the latest month for which after the fact numbers are available. That was down 11.2 percent from October and down 7.5 year over year. With on again, off again progress on trade negotiations reported throughout the fall and other factors affecting shipping, an expected surge ahead of the canceled December tariff increase did not materialize. TEU is one 20 foot long cargo container or its equivalent. December was estimated at 1.7 million TEU, down 13.4 percent from unusually high numbers seen in December 2018, when retailers had frontloaded imports ahead of a scheduled January 1,2019, tariff increase that was ultimately postponed. While numbers for the full year are not yet final, estimates indicate that 2019 came in at 21.6 million TEU, a 0.9 percent decrease from 2018 but still the second highest year on record. Imports during 2018 hit a record 21.8 million TEU, partly due to frontloading ahead of anticipated 2019 tariffs. January is forecast at 1.8 million TEU, down 5 percent from January 2019. February is forecast to be down 4.9 percent year over year at 1.54 million TEU but March is expected to be up 5.2 percent at 1.7 million TEU, with both swings tied to fluctuations in the Lunar New Year calendar and related factory shutdowns in Asia. April is forecast at 1.78 million TEU, up 2.1 percent year over year, and May is forecast at 1.87 million TEU as summer merchandise arrives, up 1 percent year over year.

Virginia congress members request Office of Management and Budget's support for Norfolk harbor project The goal is to allow the Norfolk Harbor Project to advance to its next stage of construction and receive Army Corps funding. WASHINGTON Senators and representatives from Virginia have come together to send a letter to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requesting a New Start designation for the Norfolk Harbor widening and deepening project in the Army Corps Work Plan. A New Start designation would allow the Norfolk Harbor Project to advance to its next stage of construction and receive Army Corps funding. Currently, the project is progressing using a combination of state and local funds. U. S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D VA) along with U. S. Reps. Bobby Scott (D VA) and Rob Wittman (R VA) led the entire Virginia congressional delegation to write the letter.

S. ports on both the West Coast and the East Coast are reporting record yearly results for 2019, despite the raging trade war between the U. S. and China that was one of the hottest topics impacting trade last year. The Port of Corpus Christi, the 3rd largest port in the United States, said it ended 2019 with record tonnages for December of 13.8 million cargo tons and 122.2 million cargo tons for the entire year a 16 million ton improvement over 2018 tonnages. The port attributed the growth to increases in energy exports of crude oil and liquefied natural gas. Year over year gains in crude production led to a 26.8% jump in crude exports from the port. Liquefied natural gas exports (LNG) increased 6.6 million tons overall (the equivalent of 316.8 billion cubic feet) in 2019 as a result of Cheniere Energy subsidiary Corpus Christi Liquefaction increasing production with the commissioning of its first train in November 2018 and its second train in late 2019, the port data shows. These record setting figures are not only indicative of a resilient energy export market, but are also reflective of the large infrastructure investments made by both private industry and the Port Authority as we position the Port of Corpus Christi as the Energy Port of the Americas, said Sean Strawbridge, Chief Executive Officer for the Port of Corpus Christi. We moved more than 120 million tons in 2019. The figure alone is impressive, but what is more remarkable is the exponential growth we are seeing year over year and sometimes even month over month, said Charles W. Zahn, Jr. , Port of Corpus Christi Commission Chairman. According to the preliminary results from the Port Houston, 2019 was an exceptional year for this port as well. Executive Director Roger Guenther said in December that the growth in containers was substantial, describing Port Houston as the fastest growing container port in North America. The container volume at Port Houston is expected to reach an all time high of nearly three million TEU for 2019. Guenther added that Port Houston also ranked No.1 in North America for general cargo, handling breakbulk, special project, and steel, and was expected to record four million tons of volume by year end. The Port of New York and New Jersey hit record volumes in both rail cargo and overall container throughput for November. Total volume for November 2019 reached 599,626 TEUs, a 2.7 percent increase over the same period last year. The increase brings the yearly total to 6,886,388 TEUs. From January through November 2019, imports at the Port of New York and New Jersey reached 3,497,971 TEUs, a 3.7 percent increase y o y. Exports for the same period in 2019 reached 3,388,417 TEUs, a 6.0 percent increase y o y. Despite experiencing some downturns in November due to the impact of tariffs, for the 11 months of 2019, the total volumes at the Port of Los Angeles increased 4% compared to 2018, which was the busiest year on record, the port said. Furthermore, South Carolina Ports Authority had the best calendar year in its history, handling 2.44 million TEUs in 2019, a 5% increase year over year. Breakbulk cargo was up nearly 10% from a year ago, RoRO transport was up 4%, while cruise passenger figures were up 24%, in 2019. The Port of Virginia s calendar year to date growth was nearly 4 percent ahead of the same period last year, an increase of more than 98,000 TEUs. The port s CEO John F. Reinhart said in December that the port was on course to its fifth record setting year for cargo growth.  Editorial: Amazon deal rippling across the commonwealth The purchase of this land cannot be directly linked to Amazon s decision to create an operations hub in Northern Virginia. After all, there are more than 1.6 million residents in Hampton Roads meaning plenty of potential customers as well as the Port of Virginia, where so many products enter the country, so the location is advantageous regardless.

Support for Traditional Medicinals job creation will be also provided through the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program, a new workforce initiative created by VEDP in collaboration with the Virginia Community College System, with funding support from the Northam administration and the Virginia General Assembly. Traditional Medicinals is a world class company, and Franklin County is extremely excited for them to join our business community and the growing list of firms that call the Summit View Business Park home, said Franklin County Board of Supervisors Chairman Leland Mitchell. Summit View was strategically developed to better attract companies that create high paying jobs, invest capital in our economy, and become leaders in the community. Traditional Medicinals meets all of these requirements and more. It is gratifying to see the County s vision coming to life and we thank Traditional Medicinals for their partnership and their trust in Franklin County. The Port of Virginia welcomes Traditional Medicinals to Virginia and to the state s growing coffee and tea manufacturing industry, said John F. Reinhart, CEO and Executive Director of the Virginia Port Authority. We understand that the safe, efficient movement of cargo is important to the success of Traditional Medicinals, this growing industry, and the Virginia economy. The Port has helped to nurture the growth of this industry for years by providing access to world markets and working with its leaders to support expansion. We are looking forward to a long and collaborative relationship with Traditional Medicinals.

"""" NRF Vice President Jonathan Gold WASHINGTON Imports seen during 2020 appear to be headed toward a new record despite the coronavirus pandemic", and remain at high levels as 2021 begins, according to the monthly Global Port Tracker report released today by the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates. Nobody would have thought last spring that 2020 would be a record year for imports, but it was clearly an unpredictable year, NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. Consumers and retailers once again proved their resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges. Thanks in part to government stimulus, retail sales saw strong growth during 2020 even with the pandemic, and import numbers show retailers expect the economic recovery will continue during 2021. With high import volumes over the past few months, ships carrying goods from Asia have backed up at West Coast ports in particular, and there have been shortages of shipping capacity and equipment including chassis and empty containers. With COVID 19 accelerating across the country, the pandemic is causing logistics problems beyond the congestion at the ports, Hackett Associates Founder Ben Hackett said. With large numbers of people infected by the virus and unable to report for work, the supply chain is potentially facing challenges to find enough workers for goods distribution. U. S. ports covered by Global Port Tracker handled 2.11 million Twenty Foot Equivalent Units in November, the latest month for which final numbers are available. That was up 24.5 percent year over year but down 4.9 percent from October s 2.21 million TEU, which set the record for the largest number of containers handled during a single month since NRF began tracking imports in 2002. A TEU is one 20 foot container or its equivalent. December was projected at 2.02 million TEU, up 17.3 percent year over year and one of only six times in nearly 20 years that the monthly total has hit the 2 million TEU mark. If the December number holds up once actual data is available, 2020 will have ended with a total of 21.9 million TEU, up 1.5 percent from 2019 and breaking the previous annual record of 21.8 million TEU set in 2018. Imports during the last half of 2020 set a string of new records, including an all time high of 8.3 million TEU for the July October peak season when retailers rush to bring in merchandise for the winter holidays each year. January is forecast at 1.96 million TEU, which would be up 7.7 percent from a year ago and the busiest January on record February at 1.6 million TEU, up 6.1 percent year over year, and March at 1.64 million TEU, up 19 percent from March 2020, when factories in China failed to reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday because of the coronavirus. April is forecast at 1.76 million TEU, up 9.6 percent, and May at 1.86 million TEU, up 21.7 percent, both year over year. Global Port Tracker, which is produced for NRF by the consulting firm Hackett Associates, provides historical data and forecasts for the U.

Lake Robbins Drive,"Howard Hughes buys former Anadarko towers, old ConocoPhillips campus for $565m Howard Hughes Corp. said Monday that it has bought both the former Anadarko Petroleum headquarters in The Woodlands and the old ConocoPhillips campus in the Energy Corridor from Occidental Petroleum for 565 million. Oxy will remain in the old Anadarko towers recently renamed The Woodlands Towers at The Waterway with a 13 year lease of 100 percent of the larger tower at 1201 Lake Robbins Drive and 100 percent of a 125,000 square foot warehouse nearby. The Howard Hughes Corp. will relocate its corporate headquarters from Dallas into the second tower at 9950 Woodloch Forest Drive. Before Occidental became a bidder for Anadarko this spring, Oxy planned to move into the old ConocoPhillips campus along the Energy Corridor. But after Oxy acquired Anadarko for 38 billion, the campus could no longer accommodate their combined staff. Instead, Oxy maintained its headquarters at Greenway Plaza in Houston and continued use of the old Anadarko towers as it decided what to with its excess real estate. The sale helps offset some of the nearly 40 billion debt Oxy assumed to acquire Anadarko in the biggest energy sector transaction of three years. The sale of office complexes in the Houston Energy Corridor and The Woodlands is part of our plan to divest non core assets and continue to improve the strength of our balance sheet, said Vicki Hollub, chief executive of Oxy, in a release. On HoustonChronicle. com: Howard Hughes Corp. to move headquarters amid restructuring While the Howard Hughes Corp. agreed to purchase the old ConocoPhillips campus, it said it will immediately list it for resale. It said the 63 acre, 1.3 million square foot campus, which encompasses 17 office buildings, does not fall in line with its core business of master planned communities. The company said it agreed to buy the former ConocoPhillips campus as a way to help its offer for The Woodlands towers stand out from those of other potential buyers. It added that it would consider selling the campus in one piece or in parts. Howard Hughes Corp. is the developer behind The Woodlands, and the deal not only secured it a long term tenant in the heart of its master planned community it also acquired 9.3 acres of land ripe for development in The Woodlands Town Center along the waterway and I 45 N. Paul Layne, chief executive of Howard Hughes Corp. , said in a statement that the deal would allow the company to respond to the growing need for premium office space as companies are looking to relocate and expand within The Woodlands. The company declined to specify how many employees will move from Dallas to its new headquarters in The Woodlands, but said it will not take up all of the office space at 9950 Woodloch Forest Drive. It will offer the remaining high end office space in the building for lease, Layne said. Texas Inc. : Get the best of business news sent directly to your inbox The Howard Hughes Corp. announced earlier this year it planned to focus on growing its master planned communities across the country. As part of that plan, the company said it would reduce overhead expenses by as much as 50 million per year and sell some 2 billion worth of properties in order to repurchase shares.

Erie Parkway,"Colorado town says it was scammed out of $1 million ERIE, Colo. The town of Erie revealed Monday that it was a victim of a scam regarding a more than 1 million payment to cover the construction of a bridge. The town said unknown perpetrators were able to steal 1,016,233.80 meant for SEMA Construction, Inc, the primary contractor in the construction of the Erie Parkway bridge. On Oct. 21, someone completed an electronic form on the town s website requesting a change in how SEMA would receive payments, requesting a change from check to electronic funds transfer, according to a newsletter from town administrators. The newsletter said staff checked some of the information on the form for accuracy but did not verify the authenticity of the submission with SEMA. Four days after the request was made, the town began submitting payments to the scammer s account, which the town believed belonged to SEMA. The money taken from the Town of Erie was wired out of the country, according to the newsletter. The town was notified of the fraud on Nov. 5, and an investigation was opened with the Erie Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Erie police said there is no evidence that a town employee was involved in the scam. SEMA Construction was ultimately paid for the work on the bridge using funds from an insurance claim. The town sent two physical checks totaling 1,016,233.80 to the construction firm on Nov. 15. Officials said after the incident, the town s finance director removed the online form used to perpetrate the fraud and discontinued making vendor payments via electronic funds transfer unless appropriately verified. Erie is also, as part of the town s 2020 budget request, creating two new positions: an accounting manager and a finance manager, and increasing a current part time risk manager position to full time. This story was originally published by Robert Garrison on KMGH in Denver.  Colorado Town Wires Over $1 Million to BEC Scammers Image: Town of Erie, Bleeping Computer Colorado Town of Erie lost more than 1 million to a business email compromise scam (BEC) that ended with the town's employees sending the funds to a bank account controlled by scammers. BEC (otherwise known as Email Account Compromise) is a type of financial fraud through which crooks deceive an organization's employee via computer intrusion or by using social engineering into wiring out funds to attacker controlled bank accounts. The fraudsters used an electronic form on the town's website to request a change to the payment information on the building contract for Erie Parkway Bridge awarded to SEMA Construction in October 2018. ""Specifically, the change was to receive payments via electronic funds transfer rather than by check,"" Erie Town Administrator Malcolm Fleming said in an email memo according to The Denver Post. ""Although town staff checked some of the information on the form for accuracy, they did not verify the authenticity of the submission with SEMA Construction they accepted the form and updated the payment method. "" Scammers get the money, Erie employee resigns While Erie staff should follow guidelines designed to verify the authenticity of payment information change requests, in this case, the Erie staff member failed to do so. This resulted in the payment information used to wire roughly 1,01 million to SEMA on October 25, 2019, pointing to the attackers' accounts. ""Once the payments were in that account, the perpetrators of this fraud sent the money via wire transfer out of the country,"" Fleming added in his email memo. The fraud was subsequently confirmed on November 5, when Erie staff was alerted by the bank of a possible fraud attempt and the staff was told by SEMA that the payment method request was not made from their end. SEMA was later paid on November 15 for the Erie Parkway Bridge project completion using physical checks, the initial payment method the contractor chose at the beginning of the contract. The town is actively using other information gleaned from the investigations to identify potential risk and to mitigate those risks. Malcolm Fleming Following the incident, the Town of Erie first removed the contact form from the website and temporarily discontinued electronic payments. A finance manager and an accounting manager position were also added to the staff scheme to add additional oversight to future financial operations. ""The town has filled the risk manager s position and is actively recruiting for the accounting and finance manager positions,"" Fleming explained. ""These additional positions will provide additional support, oversight, segregation of duties and management of the town s financial operations, which have expanded significantly in magnitude and complexity as the town has grown in population. "" The Town of Erie staff, the town's police department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the incident. The town is also currently working on recovering the funds lost to the BEC scammers. Bleeping Computer has reached out to the Town of Erie for for comment, but had not heard back at the time of this publication. This article will be updated when a response is received. BEC scams are big BEC victims lost more than 1,2 billion in 2018 per an Internet Crime report published by the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued its own report saying that BEC SAR (short for suspicious activity reports) filings increased from a 110 million monthly average in 2016 to more than 301 million monthly in 2018. More recently, the FBI said in a BEC public service announcement from September 2019 that victim complaints with a total exposed dollar loss of more than 26 billion and related to 166,349 incidents were received from June 2016 to July 2019. While hard to believe at first, these figures are backed by recently reported incidents such as the one in which Nikkei, one of the world's largest media organizations, reported a BEC scam that came with a loss of roughly 29 million in October. In early September, a member of the Toyota Group also announced that it had fell victim to the same type of fraud, the expected financial loss being more than over 37 million.

Kenosha County Jail,"Activists, celebrities call for Wisconsinite's release in sex trafficking murder case Nearly two years after 17 year old Chrystul Kizer was arrested for killing her alleged sex trafficker, supporters across the country and celebrities behind the MeToo movement are calling for her release an outpouring of support that prompted the Wisconsin prosecutor in the case to defend his office on Facebook. Almost 90,000 people as of Tuesday, Dec. 31, had signed a petition asking Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley to drop all charges against Kizer, who is facing life in prison. Graveley argues that Kizer planned the murder of Randall Volar III, a 34 year old white man, to steal his BMW. Kizer, now 19, says she was acting in self defense because Volar, who had been sexually abusing her for nearly two years, attempted to pin her down. Kizer's case garnered attention earlier in December when The Washington Post published a report detailing the abuse she and other underage black girls experienced at Volar's hands, and how much police and prosecutors knew about it before he was killed. ""This case is appalling,"" tweeted Alyssa Milano, an actress credited with popularizing the MeToo movement in 2017. ADVERTISEMENT This case is appalling. 17 Year Old Chrystul Kizer faces life in prison after killing her sex trafficker. She says he drugged her and attempted to rape her the night she shot him. https://t. co/LG6X9ve4BD JusticeForCrystul cc KimKardashian Alyssa Milano ( Alyssa Milano) December 23, 2019 Tarana Burke, the movement's founder, publicized Kizer's story on Instagram. ""The case of ChrystulKizer requires our attention before she is convicted and given a life sentence,"" Burke said. Milano and Burke were among those who advocated for the release of Cyntoia Brown Long, a sex trafficking victim who spent 15 years in prison for killing a man who purchased her for sex when she was 16. After being granted clemency by the governor of Tennessee, Brown Long was released in August, becoming the face of an anti trafficking movement. The goal: to educate the public that under federal law, no minor can consent to being sold for sex, no matter the circumstances. In her first op ed since being released, Brown Long spoke out on Kizer's behalf, arguing that laws must be changed to protect victims like her. RELATED: A Wisconsin man was sexually abusing underage girls. Then, police said, one of them killed him ADVERTISEMENT ""Chrystul, and all trafficking survivors, deserve the kind of justice that boldly acknowledges: 'Your life matters, too,' "" she wrote in The Post. Brown Long criticized a judge's recent ruling declaring that a Wisconsin law designed to protect trafficking victims did not apply to the charges against Kizer. Her attorneys plan to appeal the ruling. Kizer was charged with arson and first degree intentional homicide an offense that carries a mandatory life sentence in Wisconsin in June 2018. In the legal proceedings that followed, the nature of her connection with Volar became clear. The two met on Backpage, a now shuttered prostitution website, when Kizer was 16. Volar sexually abused her multiple times and filmed it. Kizer told The Post that Volar also posted her on Backpage, then drove her to hotels to be sexually abused by other men. ""He was a grown up, and I wasn't,"" she said. ""So I listened. "" As Kizer's story spread to other publications, Graveley took to social media to discuss the case a move uncharacteristic for prosecutors, who are ethically prohibited from making public comments that could influence a judge or jury. Graveley, a Democrat who is up for reelection next year, posted a lengthy statement on his campaign Facebook page. ""I am respectfully asking folks who are interested in the Chrystul Kizer case to reserve judgment until the facts are presented in court at trial,"" he wrote. After detailing the evidence against Kizer, Graveley defended the actions of his office, which was investigating Volar in connection with crimes including child sexual assault before he was killed. Documents obtained by The Post show that in February 2018, police arrested Volar, then released him the same day. Three months passed before police sent their evidence on Volar to Graveley's office. They had found that Volar was abusing approximately a dozen underage black girls, including ones who appeared to be as young as 12 or 13. Still, Volar was not taken into custody. He was killed 12 days later. ADVERTISEMENT Graveley stated on Facebook that a sex crimes prosecutor ""was appropriately reviewing the referral involving the investigation of Volar"" during that time. ""As District Attorney, I cannot condone vigilante justice,"" he wrote. ""When presented with evidence of premeditated murder, I do not believe it is appropriate for prosecutors to weigh the value of the victim's life. "" In an interview, Graveley explained that he felt compelled to write the post because his office received more than 100 calls and social media messages about the case, some of which were ""abusive and threatening. "" ""The reason why something had to be posted to Facebook was because folks in my office were feeling unsafe,"" he said. He is not planning to drop the charges against Kizer, no matter how many signatures or celebrity endorsements she receives. ""A prosecutor can't make decisions about criminal cases based on how many people contact the office,"" he said. For now, the case is at a standstill until Kizer's public defenders file an appeal, which they plan to do in January. Then, they will learn whether an appeals court will take up the case a process that could delay the jury trial for months. For Kizer, that means more time in the Kenosha County Jail. On Christmas, she spoke to her mother Devore Taylor three times. Taylor has spent months trying to rally local activists to help her daughter. Now, their small group is receiving offers of assistance from around the world. ""I think it makes Chrystul feel better just to know that she isn't by herself,"" Taylor said. A GoFundMe page that Taylor runs has received more than 12,000 in donations money she can use to send her daughter snacks, books and credits to use on a tablet provided by the jail. The credits let Kizer listen to music and watch TV. As the new year approached, her mom said, she was watching the Twilight movies to pass the time.

Previous Next filed under: Racine man accused of punching RPD officer, striking family members, pleads not guilty RACINE A Racine man with two pending felony criminal cases one for reportedly punching an off duty Racine Police officer after an OWI crash caused by the officer, and the other for allegedly striking two family members pleaded not guilty to the charges in court Thursday. George E. Gayton, 44, of the 2000 block of Mead Street, is charged with felony substantial battery in the first case, and felony counts of attempted strangulation and suffocation and physically abuse of a child, intentionally causing bodily harm and misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct, criminal damage to property and battery in the second. The case involving Racine Police Officer Sam Stulo, from 2018, is being prosecuted by the Kenosha County District Attorney s Office to avoid a conflict of interest. During Thursday s hearing, it appeared that Gayton s second case, from last year, may also be handled by the Kenosha DA s Office, however that decision is not yet final. Gayton on Thursday waived his right to a preliminary hearing. His next court appearance is an arraignment scheduled for Jan. 17 at the Racine County Law Enforcement Center, 717 Wisconsin Ave. Drunk, angry and out of control On Thanksgiving Day, Mount Pleasant Police responded to the 2100 block of Mead Street after a woman called and said her uncle, Gayton, was allegedly drunk, angry and out of control, according to the criminal complaint for the 2019 incident. Gayton reportedly approached her car and kicked it. When one of the woman s sisters tried telling Gayton to stop, Gayton reportedly struck her in the face and yelled at her. Gayton is also accused of trying to choke his 16 year old niece, who tried to intervene, and then breaking the car s back window with a metal chair, the complaint stated. Caught on tape Gayton allegedly punched Stulo on Dec. 17, 2018, after a crash in the 1900 block of State Street that was caused by Stulo and in which Gayton s aunt was involved, according to a 2018 criminal complaint. Stulo was later determined to be intoxicated. Stulo said that after the crash he pulled over and Gayton approached, accusing him of trying to get away. Stulo said he pulled out his badge and his phone and Gayton punched him in the throat. Surveillance footage from the nearby BP Gas Station, 1975 State St. , reportedly shows Gayton hitting Stulo. Medical records show that the punch resulted in Stulo s voice box being fractured. After the crash, Stulo was convicted of first offense OWI, causing injury. In June, he was sentenced to 30 days in the Kenosha County Jail. Stulo has since returned to work at the Racine Police Department but was demoted from sergeant to a traffic investigator.

Snapshot: Dr. Dominique Pritchett  People get into human services or social work definitely not for the money, so I knew that the passion had to be there. And I d like to think I ve been through hell and back probably twice, through those childhood experiences, so I know I have something to offer individuals who are going through similar experiences, said Dr. Dominique Pritchett. Pritchett, who grew up often homeless in Kenosha, has a doctorate in clinical psychology from Capella University in Minneapolis. She also has a master s degree in social work from Loyola University and graduated from Carthage College. One of seven children, Pritchett is the second oldest and oldest girl in her family. One of seven, and there was always one bathroom that s what I remember, she said. So in addition to the homelessness, I ve had my fair share of trauma, exposure to trauma, addiction in my family. So, through all of those experiences, it has shaped the person I am today, and without them, I don t think I would be as resilient as I am today. Pritchett has a public talk on the topic, titled Trauma, the Black Child and the Educational System, scheduled at the Kenosha Civil War Museum on Tuesday, Jan. 21, from 6 to 8 p. m. It is being put on by Courageous Conversations. So, it will be myself as a presenter with Dr. Michelle Hancock and then there will be a panel discussing the topic in total, Pritchett said. One of my goals is to open up my own mental health private practice later in 2020 in Kenosha. Another endeavor is her consulting company called Dominique Pritchett and Co. , where she offers personal and professional development services and consulting for individuals focusing on mental health clinicians and entrepreneurship. Pritchett enjoys reading with a book club and traveling, with trips planned to Botswana, Bali and Dubai. Here are a few more things that Pritchett recently shared in an interview with the Kenosha News: Q: Where is work for you? A: Today it was at the jail. I m employed through Kenosha Visiting Nurses however, we provide correctional health care services inside the Kenosha County Jail and Detention Center, (KCDC and the intake downtown), so that is my part time job. I think the KVNA has been the service provider providing health care services for over 25 years down there. Q: And how long have you been doing that at that location? A: Six years. Q: And you re currently finishing your post doctoral training? A: Yes, so I am now a doctor of psychology, and my post doc is at Allendale Association in Lake Villa, Ill. I just started there in August, and I should be there about a year or longer, but a year to finish my post doc hours to apply for licensure. Q: What is that like, finishing post doctoral work? A: You think school ended, but it didn t really end because the post doc is just an extension of your learning experience, but by the state of Wisconsin and Illinois. They require you to get so many clinical hours after your degree, so I think the total hours I need is 3,000 hours, split up between face to face and non face to face. It s rigorous it s very challenging. Every day is something new. We work with a very complex population. So at Allendale, they have the Stepping Stone day treatment school for children with mental health challenges. Our goal is to provide them therapeutic treatment services so that they can hopefully re integrate back into their regular educational system. Q: What would you say would be a formative primary memory that led you to do the work that you do? A: Growing up homeless, so it s not one memory, it s a collection of memories. But being homeless off and on until the day that I turned 18 and went to college I did go to Carthage for my undergrad. But having experienced that and having the number of individuals who helped me and my family get on our feet time after time, that made such an imprint in my life that I knew that s what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Q: You mentioned resilience. That is one of the things that you wanted to develop for children and their ability to weather situations? A: My dissertation for my doctorate education, I focused on resiliency based interventions, used strategically to empower children who have been traumatized and parentified. Parentification, or a parentified child, is a child who had their childhood stolen and placed in a parental role much earlier than needed. So, as a result of having their childhood stolen, they missed out on that development, that trust building, that relationship building. And what my research showed, later in life, as it correlates with the adverse childhood experiences study, as a variable to adverse childhood experiences, individuals later in life have a higher likelihood of suicide, mental illness, addiction. So the programs that I m looking to develop is to focus on that variable what do we do for the child that did not have a childhood? I went through Kenosha Unified most of my education. People knew things about my family. People knew things about my mom, that she struggled with addictions and incarcerations, but people always assumed that I had it all together. I was that sassy girl who was a two sport athlete, maintained her grades and raised five siblings at the age of fourteen. So no one thought to ask, What s happening? I always wore my resilience on my sleeve, but there were other people who saw this depressed and angry girl. But I d like to think that resilience was misinterpreted. But what I needed to give the world was this defense, so people perceived it as anger but it was me being as resilient as possible. When I do consulting work with school districts, or I get clients referred to me from school districts, I often challenge the system to take a look at themselves and how are they filtering that child s experiences. Because when a child has had their childhood stolen, we adults tend to keep them in that role. And we see that in the juvenile justice system, we see that in the educational system. Once a child has been identified as being too grown or thinking they know it all, we start to treat them like that. But really, they re children who are screaming for help. But we done exactly what their families systems have done we take their childhood because they look like they have it all together. Q: So in order to give children back their childhood that they may have missed, what would be the most important things that you think they need to be provided with, or shown or given? A: Well, in my dissertation I developed a community based program that I do have great intentions of implementing and taking it as far as international. But when people are developing programs, they re developing programs on what they think would be helpful, but based on my research, we have to tap into what kids are most excited about: that s creativity, about being heard. So really developing programs that are preventative. In my dissertation, my program has three levels of prevention: the primary level of prevention, when we start to see possible parentification or see a child struggling with trauma or behavioral issues. Secondary is OK, this child is identified, we have to really wrap our hands around them, do a wrap around approach to prevent any further exacerbation of trauma, mental illness, addiction. . We have to be intentional when we develop programs. A lot of times, funders typically drive how we offer programs, who we can offer it to, but we can t possibly develop any program unless it s resiliency driven and client driven. Sure, we re the host of the program, but if it s not going to meet the communities or be applicable to the communities that I m looking to implement it in, what good was the program. . It takes me understanding who I m serving and what they need to develop those programs and my research led me to that. As a mental health clinician, we have these assessments, your psycho social history, family history, education, work, all of that, but what I realized is that parentified children they re in a whole other category and a lot of these kids often go either under diagnosed, misdiagnosed or over diagnosed because of a variable people don t consider as trauma and that s having your childhood stolen and expected to function as an adult at age five. I recall such a dominant memory is that my mom went to prison. She sold to an undercover cop and she went to jail. At that point in time, I had to put everything I wanted aside my dreams, my hobbies, my goals and raise five children that were under me. So there were times that I had to portray to be her. I would get calls from their principals to take care of them. Raising five kids as a teenager, it was hard. It was really hard. For a long time I struggled with (the) guilt of even going to school, going to college, because when you have unresolved issues that you take it into your next phase of life, a lot of times in African American communities there is a sense of guilt, of like, Dang, I left my community. But me, I left my family behind. So that s something I had to work through throughout the four years I was at Carthage. What good am I, to be able to endure what I am studying, social work, if I am not well? There was a point in time that I had to tell my siblings, You have to live your life now, I ve done all I could. . For a long time, I enabled my mother to think it was OK to let me raise her kids. I m a woman of faith, and I always thank God I don t look like the hell I ve been through. Seriously, when I think of some of the experiences I have found myself in, engaging in behaviors just longing for relationships and connections, searching for my childhood because it was stolen, I m like, Oh God, I turned out OK.

Driving stoned: Deputy arrests impaired Illinois driver The Kenosha County Sheriff s Department said a 39 year old Antioch, Ill. , woman who was driving 45 mph on I 94 appeared to be dazed and confused after a traffic stop early Sunday morning. A deputy stopped the vehicle at I 94 and Highway E around 3 a. m. Sunday when a witness alerted authorities to the woman s erratic driving. According to the police report, the woman told a deputy she smoked a marijuana blunt in Chicago shortly before driving home. The woman said she had no clue where she was and was unaware she drove 12 miles past her Illinois exit. When the deputy asked for her driver s license and proof of insurance, the woman dug through two separate bags before locating both cards. The woman showed the deputy her driver s license and said she couldn t find her insurance card, despite holding the card in her hand. Upon further questioning, the woman put her head back on the driver s seat and nodded off, according to the police report. A breath test conducted at the scene revealed no signs of alcohol. The woman was arrested for operating while intoxicated (first offense) and cited for deviation from a designated lane. She was taken to a local hospital for a blood draw and transported to the Kenosha County Jail. The woman eventually told authorities she was happy they pulled her over because she knew she could ve hurt herself or someone else, according to the police report. Starting Jan. 1, recreational marijuana was made legal in Illinois, though it remains illegal in Wisconsin. In December, local law enforcement issued statements warning people that possession of marijuana and driving stoned can land you in jail. Marijuana purchased in Illinois must be consumed in Illinois, officials said, and they also warned people about driving stoned. Our deputies will continue their duties educating people about the laws of controlled substances and the dangers of driving under the influence, the sheriff s department said.

Kyle Rittenhouse pleads not guilty to charges in Kenosha protest shootings Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teenager accused of fatally shooting two protesters in Kenosha, Wis. , last year, on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. Rittenhouse, now 18 years old, filed his plea during a brief hearing conducted via Zoom. The teen was 17 years old when he allegedly killed the two people. Rittenhouse is charged with first degree intentional homicide in the incident and attempted intentional homicide in the wounding of a third person during the August incident. He s also facing a misdemeanor charge of underage firearm possession for wielding a semi automatic rifle. He faces life in prison. ADVERTISEMENT Prosecutors say that Rittenhouse went from Antioch, Ill. , to Kenosha in August during mass protests against the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man who was ultimately left paralyzed from the waist down. Rittenhouse was responding to calls to defend local businesses and allegedly shot the three protesters with an assault style rifle. The teen has argued that he was acting in self defense, and he was released from the Kenosha County Jail in November on a 2 million cash bail that was paid through an account set up by his attorneys. Rittenhouse s case has divided the nation, with conservatives rallying around him as someone exercising his Second Amendment rights and social justice advocates casting him as a harmful individual who arrived in Kenosha to hurt protesters. Rittenhouse will return to court and face a jury on March 29.

Citracado Parkway,"Rosie’s staff runs Escondido cafe while owner recovers from hit-and-run crash Almost a year to the day after Escondido s then struggling Rosie s Cafe was chosen for a TV makeover on Food Network s Restaurant: Impossible series, the eatery s owner is now engaged in a struggle of her own. On the evening of Dec. 21, owner Kaitlyn Rose Pilsbury, 33, was seriously injured when her motorcycle was struck by a hit and run driver in an SUV near her home in Vista. She has been recuperating in the intensive care unit at Palomar Medical Center ever since. On Tuesday morning, family members posted an update of her condition on a family run Gofundme page, saying: Every day she shows more progress. As news of the accident spreads, Rosie s Cafe has become a gathering space for friends, customers and community members. The restaurant at 117 W. Grand Ave. was closed for four days after the accident. But since it reopened Dec. 26, waitress Sarah Zenns said customer traffic has been tremendous as visitors have come in to dine, drop off cash donations for Pilsbury and write notes of support for her in a journal near the cash register. It s so nice to see people coming in and giving back to her because she was always the first one to help before anyone even asked, Zenns said. Advertisement Kaitlyn Rose Pilsbury, 33, the owner of Rosie s Cafe in Escondido. (Courtesy photo) Regulars Gerald and Mickey DeSoto of Escondido came in Monday afternoon for lunch. Then they signed the journal and dropped a few 20 bills into the donation bucket. She is such a fun person, said Gerald, a 31 year resident of Escondido. She s bubbly, energetic and a very kind person. It s terrible what happened to her. Willie and Paulina Rodriguez of J. R. Organics farm in Escondido also arrived on Monday for lunch. We heard about what happened and we want to support local business owners whenever we can. This is our first time here but we ll be back, Willie said. According to the Vista Sheriff s Department, Pilsbury was riding her motorcycle northbound on Melrose Drive, just north of West Vista Way, at 8:06 p. m. on Saturday, Dec. 21. Deputies believe that a man driving a white Ford Explorer southbound on Melrose may have turned left into the path of Pilsbury s motorcycle to enter the parking lot of a strip mall that s home to an Auto Zone store and a Wendy s restaurant, according to Sgt. Hernan Gonzalez with the Sheriff s Vista traffic division. The driver of the Ford immediately abandoned the vehicle and fled the scene on foot. After an extensive search of the area, the man could not be found. The registered owner of the Ford was contacted and is not believed to be the driver. The driver was described as a male with dark complexion in his 30s, 6 feet tall with a slender build. The suspect had short hair and a dark colored beard, approximately 4 inches in length. A search for the man is still under way, Gonzalez said. Anyone who witnessed the accident or has information on the suspect is asked to call Deputy Jason Malson at (760) 940 4556. A journal near the cash register at Rosie s Cafe in Escondido on Monday is filled with hand written notes of support from customers for cafe owner Kaitlyn Rose Pilsbury, 33, who was seriously injured Dec. 21 in a hit and run accident. (Pam Kragen / The San Diego Union Tribune) Pilsbury suffered extensive injuries in the crash. Co workers said she had broken bones in her legs and one arm that required surgery. She also had some bone breakage in her spine as well as brain swelling that left her comatose for several days. Friends and co workers said that in the past few days, Pilsbury has awakened, her eyes are open and tracking people in the room and she can respond to questions by holding up her fingers on one hand. Still, her family wrote on the Gofundme page that she is facing a long recovery. Kaitlyn s motto is never quit. She writes it down everywhere and she wears it on her shirts. That s what she s doing now, she s not going to quit. She s from a long line of strong women and she is going to fight to recover from this, Zenns said. A New Jersey native, Pilsbury opened Rosie s Cafe in December 2016. She named it in honor of her grandmother, Carria Rose, and decorated it with a nostalgic Rosie the Riveter theme. Rosie s took over a space that has been occupied as a diner since 1923. It started out as the Chat n Chew, then changed hands in 1955, when owners Ted and Violet McCain renamed it McCain s. They introduced Ted s grandfather s signature cinnamon rolls. The McCains passed along the cinnamon roll recipe to the restaurant s next owners, Oscar and Eva Champion, who renamed the space Champion s Family Restaurant in 1972. When the Champions retired, their daughter Annette took over, but she closed the restaurant in fall 2016. A few months later, Pilsbury leased the building and Annette Champion shared the McCains recipes with her. By 2018, Rosie s Cafe was in trouble so Pilsbury applied for a 10,000 makeover by chef Robert Irvine on his recently revived Restaurant: Impossible series. Irvine and camera crew arrived last Jan. 9 for the three day whirlwind renovation. Irvine s team gave the cafe a vibrant retro look that included a mural dedicated to Carria Rose. Irvine also upgraded and reduced the size of the menu, tutored Pilsbury on calculating food costs and taught new cooking techniques to the kitchen staff. After hearing about Pilsbury s accident over the weekend, Irvine updated his Instagram profile with the link to the Gofundme campaign, which has so far raised more than 16,000. Family members say the money will be used to pay Pilsbury s medical and personal bills and will go toward keeping the doors open at Rosie s Cafe. Because a long hospitalization is anticipated, Patti Thompson, the administrator of the Escondido Friends page on Facebook, encouraged the public to send letters and cards of encouragement to Pilsbury at Palomar Medical Center, 2185 Citracado Parkway, Escondido Ca 92029. Chef Robert Irvine talks with Rosie s Cafe owner Kaitlyn Rose Pilsbury outside her downtown Escondido restaurant during filming of the Food Network series Restaurant Impossible in January 2019. (Courtesy of Restaurant: Impossible) After the episode aired on Food Network in April, customer traffic had grown. Some regulars have complained online about the higher food prices and the loss of some favorite menu items. In the fall, Pilsbury hired a new kitchen manager, brought back some of the old menu items, expanded the shop s pie baking program and had recently introduced weekly barbecue and live music nights. Although business has been brisk over the past week, Zenns said that Pilsbury was the heart and soul of the business and it s been hard for her 14 employees to carry on without her. They ve been keeping the doors open later every day to welcome customers but most of the staff is exhausted. To rest up, they closed on Tuesday and will reopen on Jan. 2. We re working really hard and we re all tired, but it s been so nice to see the outpouring of support from the community, Zenns said. I think Kaitlyn would be really proud of us for being here to keep her dream alive. Staff writer Teri Figueroa, teri. figueroa sduniontribune, contributed to this report.  New Tri-City psych facility to come in next few years OCEANSIDE The County and Tri City Medical Center have officially approved their plans to build a psychiatric health facility on Tri City s campus. The agreement follows a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the hospital and the County of San Diego approved back in September that outlined plans for a 16 bed inpatient behavioral health facility to be constructed on Tri City s main campus. As per the MOU, both the county and Tri City would equally fund the new facility s development with Tri City contributing property and the county to pay for construction. The County will contribute 17.4 million to build the facility. Specifically, the County will lease the property where the facility will be built, construct the building and then sublease the building to Tri City. During the term of the sublease, Tri City will operate the facility and repay the County 50% of the construction costs over time through lease agreements and services. It s taken more than a year and a half to get here, said Leigh Anne Grass, chairperson of the Tri City Board of Directors at a Jan. 13 event celebrating the agreement. In 2018, Tri City decided to suspend the operation of its 18 bed inpatient behavioral health unit, a portion of which also served as a 12 chair crisis stabilization unit that helped to mitigate the number of people who needed inpatient care. The hospital closed its inpatient behavioral health unit due to a change in federal regulations that required them to remove ligature risks features that patients could use to hang themselves from rooms. The unit had drop ceilings, which consists of removable tiles that hide pipes and other fixtures. Both the cost and time needed to remove the drop ceilings was too great along with other needed renovations to the dated unit, so the hospital had to close the unit altogether. The MOU between the County and Tri City did not include a new crisis stabilization unit. Instead, the County approved a plan back in October that would open a crisis stabilization unit at the County s Live Well Health Center in Oceanside. Since its inpatient behavioral health unit closed, Tri City has still operated outpatient services from its clinic in Vista. According to Tri City spokesperson Aaron Byzak, that clinic sees more than 50 people per day. Our focus has and continues to be improving the continuum of mental health in our community, Byzak said. I feel strongly that this new psychiatric health facility in combination with what we re already doing with our intensive outpatient behavioral health program and what the County is planning is an opportunity to improve the continuum of care. Our hope is that the result will be a significant improvement in the long term clinical outcomes for our patients. After Tri City s inpatient behavioral health unit closed, Palomar Medical Center was inundated with cases that the Oceanside hospital would have previously taken. Later his year, Palomar s 22 bed facility will cease operations after selling the Downtown Escondido campus. In the meantime, according to Palomar spokesperson Derryl Acosta, Palomar s 12 bed geriatric behavioral health facility in Poway will be converted to serve adults of all ages. A crisis stabilization unit with double the capacity of Palomar s current one is being built on the hospital s new campus on Citracado Parkway. Acosta said the hospital has been in discussions with the county about constructing a new inpatient behavioral health facility on Palomar s new hospital campus sometime in the next four or five years, but nothing has been finalized. The Tri City psychiatric facility could take up to three years to open. Supervisors Jim Desmond and Kristin Gaspar were big supporters of the new psychiatric facility. They organized a Jan. 13 event at Tri City Medical Center meant to celebrate the agreement between the Tri City and the County. This along with a crisis stabilization unit will make getting behavioral health services in North County easier than the path to crime and jail, Desmond said at the event.

Napa County Library,"Sharing the Spirit: Norma Ortiz shares her dedication to language learning Norma Ortiz was three years old when she immigrated to the United States. She d come from Mexico, along with her mother, who didn t speak any English. Ortiz herself learned English as a student attending school in San Jose, California. Still, she watched her mother grapple with the language barrier. It made crucial everyday tasks going to the doctor, for example into an obstacle, so Ortiz would accompany her mother, acting as a translator. I was able to see how people were struggling around me firsthand because of the English barrier, Ortiz said. I was always very involved in helping the people around me. It s a pursuit she s never forgotten. Now a mother herself, Ortiz says she s dedicated over 500 hours this year alone to doing volunteer work in the community. Her primary focus is working with English language learners primarily Spanish speakers who, like Ortiz s mother, sometimes struggle to engage with their community because of the language gap. In my family, we were always taught a value system that emphasized helping other every way we could, Ortiz said. Today, that translates into being a role model for her bilingual 10 year old daughter, who attends Pueblo Vista Elementary School in Napa. It has a dual immersion program. Ortiz began volunteering at Napa County Library in their literacy center in 2013. She took the English as a Second Language (ESL) program at the library under wing under her tutelage, the class has grown from 6 regular students to 23, Ortiz said. She also works to tutor individuals who need extra help outside of class, and runs the library s citizenship classes, which cater to those looking to pass the United States citizenship test. There s no telling how many people Ortiz has impacted, directly or indirectly, with her work scores of students have benefit from her English teaching, and she guesses she s helped more than 20 people become permanent citizens. No one has ever failed, Ortiz said, of the citizenship test. A few days before, she added, she d just heard from a student who was taking the citizenship test they d spent most of Saturday together, Ortiz guiding her through her studying. She said, I passed the test, and it s thanks to your support, and to the library, Ortiz said, recounting a phone call with her student. I m thinking well, we re thankful to have you here. Fostering a foundational knowledge of the English language, especially with adult learners, is not easy. Ortiz says her many students range from about 18 to 50, and some older still. For students with no conceptual knowledge of the English language, building that foundation can take from two to six years, Ortiz said. Even with the tremendous amount of patience required to learn a language, Ortiz has found immense success: she s had students who have exited the program entirely, she said, and who have been promoted at their jobs to supervisors or managers as a result of their increased English proficiency. The hard part is engaging them, developing that rapport with students, that connection, Ortiz said. It s not just about academics. This year, the library permanently established a paid position for Ortiz she now gets paid to do the work she d always done as a volunteer, something she attributes to the influx of students and her consistency. She invests in each of her students, Ortiz added, working with each to develop a one month and then three month plan for their goals. She gives homework to every class, encourages participation from every student and tests students frequently to assess her curriculum. I always tell them we have to have patience, and we have to have persistence. And goals, Ortiz said. I try to keep the class at a level they re comfortable at without losing the connection to their culture. In pursuit of honoring students connections with their respective cultures, Ortiz s ESL class is currently compiling a bilingual cookbook. Recipes will be in Spanish and English and one in Japanese. Ortiz s students will help her put together recipes and pictures the book, once finished, will be displayed at the library s literacy center. She credits the library s support with the success of the programs she s helped to lead. Even if they didn t pay me for this, I would continue to do both, she said, of the ESL and citizenship classes, adding that she finds the work rewarding. I m very invested in my community, because Napa has given a lot to me. I love to be here, and help in any way possible. To register for any of Ms. Ortiz s ESL or Citizenship classes offered through the Napa County Library, call 707 253 4283 or email robin. rafael countyofnapa. org. The next Citizenship cycle starts in Jan. 18. Para apuntarse por alguna de los clases ingleses o de ciudadan a Estadounidense de Sra.

Christine Tina Grant was born on March 23, 1952 in Framingham, Massachusetts to Mary Marjorie (Foley) and William E. Grant. She was the youngest of five the only redhead in the family and her brothers and sisters Sue, Bill, Ellen and John, loved to tease her about that, especially since the milkman also happened to have had red hair! As the youngest girl in a large family, she claimed to have been spoiled as well as having gotten away with all kinds of things that her siblings never would have attempted. She grew up in Hopedale and attended school there she was both an all star softball catcher as well as a member of the All State chorus. After high school, she attended Newton Wellesley Nursing School, which is where she met and friended her future sister in law, Becky. At some point during their senior year, Becky and friend Denise, brought Tina home to Boothbay during one of their breaks. During their trip, Becky handed Tina a photo album and told her that women were scarce in Boothbay in the winter so she basically could have her choice of any single man in the album! She quickly chose Steve, and to no one s surprise, the picture that she stopped on was one of him holding his small son, Robbie. Steve believed it was because he was one handsome devil, but the rest of us know the real story Tina was always a sucker for kids, babies, you name it they were always drawn to her caring, nurturing personality. As the story goes, Steve pretended to not be thrilled with his sister s attempted set up, but in reality, we know that he really didn t mind being paired with an intelligent, gorgeous woman who welcomed his son with open arms. She soon graduated, became an RN, and moved to the Harbor with Becky and Denise. On June 15, 1974 Steve and Tina were married and the rest is history. In addition to her coveted role as stepmom to little Robbie, Tina gave birth to three daughters, Heather Delia (d. 8/2/1976), Katie Constance (b. 11/2/1977), and Heidi Marjorie (b. 7/12/1982. ) Tina was also a proud aunt to Paul, Monica, Faithanne, Suzanne, Amy, Bridget, Eric, Stephen, and Brian and when each of them were born, she would rush down to help care for them in their early days. She was also a surrogate mom to many of her daughters friends over the years, there were few that met her that didn t quickly feel like they were an extension to the family. Her second most coveted role, after Mum, was being a nurse. She began her career in long term care working at what she and her colleagues lovingly called the old Gregory Wing which at that time was over at St. Andrews Hospital. She made many dear friends in this role, Nancy, Olma, Mickey just to name a few and they worked hard and loved being a part of residents and families lives striving to change what nursing homes were thought to be. Tina was a resident advocate, and a compassionate caring nurse who always went above and beyond to make the needs and wishes of her residents become a reality. She was a quiet, loving person, but could become a tiger unleashed when fighting for what was right and what her residents really needed. Many a doctor could well attest to the force to be reckoned with she could become when needed! Tina was a major player in successfully relocating the old Gregory Wing to the new St. Andrews Village and made sure with planning and help that every resident had an escort, and when they entered their new environment, chicken soup was cooking on the stove and a warm welcome awaited all! Tina s career in long term care also included: Skilled Director at Sedgewood Commons in Yarmouth, Midcoast Hospital Senior Center, Coves Edge, and most recently Resident Care Director at the Harborview Cottage of the Lincoln Home. Everywhere Tina went, she brought her passion for resident quality of life and advocacy. She was loved and respected by all her peers, residents, and their families. Tina quietly mentored many staff members always having an ear to listen and was more than willing to share wisdom and guidance when asked. Tina often said her family had a standing joke asking not to make eye contact with people when out in public because she would end up knowing their life stories and then trying to help she just had that aura about her. Tina loved her family beyond all things, and she also loved music (although not so much country) she often said, If I die and I hear country and western music at my funeral I ll know I went to hell! Her all time favorite had to have been Barry Manilow she, Steve and the girls attended probably close to a dozen of his concerts over the years her last concert this past February was his Vegas show and Tina was in her glory! Tina had a strong faith and shared that her mother had once said that our bodies are like wearing a heavy winter coat and when we die our spirit gets to take off that coat and be free. Through her many years of nursing, Tina was often at the bedside of many dying residents. She was a trailblazer in changing our culture of end of life care. She never let anyone die alone and always made the environment peaceful, loving, and respectful, she believed that death, just like birth, is a sacred time. She is survived by her husband Steve children Robbie (and wife Margaret), Katie (and partner John), and Heidi brothers William and John sister Ellen sisters in law Susie (and husband Steve) and Becky (and husband Bruce) grandchildren Robyn (and husband Chris), Elizabeth, Amelia and Sylas seven nieces and nephews, their spouses, and many great nieces and nephews. A celebration of life is tentatively planned for the spring. Donations in Tina s name can be made to the Boothbay Region Ambulance Service, P. O. Box 280, Boothbay, ME 04537. Hall s of Boothbay has care of the arrangements.
