Globeville,"Property values are up more than 50% in this isolated neighborhood 3 miles from downtown Denver The Globeville neighborhood remains one of Denver's most affordable and historic neighborhoods, even as it's surrounded by change on all sides. DENVER Though the skyscrapers of downtown loom just on the other side of the Platte River, the Globeville neighborhood has had a distinct character separate from the Mile High City throughout its long history. Once ranchland, Globeville s land was purchased by the Globe Smelter Company in 1885 attracting a huge population of European immigrants to the area. Some of those families have stayed in the rows of houses that make up Globeville for generations, staying put even as Interstate 70 and I 25 sliced through the area in the 1960s. Today, Globeville s boundaries are the South Platte River to the east and south, Inca Street to the west, and 52nd Avenue to the north. The River North Art District, with its breweries and luxury condos, is just south of the neighborhood, and the National Western Stock Show Complex is to the north. Median property values have risen 50% in two years in Globeville prompting concerns about the displacement of the community s longtime residents and gentrification in one of Denver s last relatively affordable communities. This story is part of the weekly 9Neighborhoods series. Join us at noon on Friday on the 9NEWS Instagram for a photo tour of Globeville. Have a recommendation for which neighborhood we should check out next? Email us at webteam 9news. com. How a neighborhood about 20 blocks from downtown can actually be considered isolated As the crow flies, the Globeville neighborhood is technically closer to Union Station than City Park. But over the years, it s become intersected by interstates (there are only two ways to cross I 70 in Globeville s boundaries) and railroad tracks. There s also the Platte River itself. This meant that, unlike other Denver neighborhoods, Globeville grew inward around the smelter instead of outward. Between the late 1880s and 1920s, eastern European and Russian immigrants moved into Globeville to work low paying jobs at the smelter, the railroad or in the meatpacking industry. As some members of those families moved out of the neighborhood, they were replaced by a new, largely Hispanic community. Today, Globeville s population is around 4,200 people. More than half of those residents identify as Latino, and 20% are immigrants, according to DenverMetroData. org. The community s median household income is 46,225.57 well below the Denver metro region s median of 97,284.99. More than one third of Globeville s population lives in poverty, according to the same data. Old churches representing its diverse history dot the Globeville neighborhood. Mary Lou Egan, a Denver native whose grandparents lived in Globeville, made a map that essentially shows the neighborhood s progression and illustrates a cool walking tour of its history. Check that map out below: What does the future of Globeville look like? While the mixed use Taxi development is sometimes mischaracterized as being in RiNo, it's actually within Globeville boundaries. But Mickey Zeppelin, the developer responsible for Taxi and other prominent properties on the other side of the Platte, said he has a different vision for the future of Globeville. ""Globeville isn't going to be the next RiNo,"" Zeppelin said. ""Globeville needs to have its own character. I think Globeville has the possibility of becoming a major part of Denver in terms of the environment. There's probably as much parkland here as anywhere else in the city. "" Denver City Councilwoman Candi Cdebaca now represents Globeville and grew up nearby. She said she had family in the neighborhood's boundaries, and has watched people she knows get displaced by rising costs, even as improvements are coming to the area. ""I really hope that some of the changes will be available to the population that has endured generations of disinvestment the amenities, the newfound growth and opportunities are this neighborhood's inheritance, and I hope we can figure out how to protect these communities from involuntary displacement so they get to reap the benefits of their generational investment,"" Cdebaca said. The median property value in the city of Denver is 416,000. Denverite reports that Globeville's median 2019 property value was 292,400 up about 50% since 2017. Part of this is due to the expansion of the neighboring National Western Complex, which is expected to bring new development to Globeville and the Elyria Swansea neighborhoods. Zeppelin said efforts are underway to improve Washington Street, Globeville's main thoroughfare. Washington Street will really be an important main street. Right now, it s pretty much a commercial street and not really much shopping,"" Zeppelin said. ""It needs a supermarket, it needs all of the services that cities have, and I think it will have a pharmacy, cleaners, a beauty salon, etc I think it will be an important main street, it will have a fabulous plaza for people to meet. Cdebaca said there are benefits to development like new sidewalks and paved alleyways but said she hopes it doesn't negate the character of the neighborhood. We wanted connections with business and affordability those two things should not negate each other, you should be able to have all those things and live in an affordable community,"" Cdebaca said.

Globeville,"Big Impact with a Small Footprint Freddie Martin, a student of history and anthropology, talks to me outside his home in Denver on a cloudy day in December. He s a formidable character who grew up in Beaumont, Texas with strong viewpoints on the state of politics in our country. He shares some of his writing with me just outside House 6, his home at the Beloved Community Village. I ve been through quite a bit in my time, says Martin. I ve been housing insecure for over a decade. Martin has been a Villager since March 2018, after meeting Cilla Wolf, a former Beloved Community Village resident, on the campus of Metro State University. Being here has given him the chance to finish his degrees. The Colorado Village Collaborative exists to create and operate transformational housing communities for people exiting homelessness and entering housing. The fight for decriminalization of homelessness and finding housing solutions has been a long one in Denver. Like Charlotte, the city has seen rapid growth over the past two decades. The median home value has risen from 222,550 to 409,900 in the past 10 years. Average rent for a one bedroom apartment is 1,423 a month. To afford an apartment within 10 miles of metro Denver, an individual making minimum wage salary, which is 11.10/hour, four dollars more than that of North Carolina, must work 130 hours a week, four weeks a month. People are regularly pushed out of areas as gentrification sweeps in leaving limited affordable housing options close to jobs, food and services. Denver Homeless Out Loud started building tiny homes in 2013 following the passage of an Unauthorized Camping Ban ordinance which made it illegal for those experiencing homelessness to sleep on public property. When the group organized the voices of those living on the streets, one of the ideas that quickly popped up was the idea of creating a tiny home village. It was something people on the street specifically wanted, says Cole Chandler. We didn t dream this up in a lab somewhere. Chandler, who cites his faith as a leading factor in his work, is a community organizer and serves as the co director of the Colorado Village Collaborative. (Note: In December, the U. S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case in which the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a camping ban in Boise, Idaho, and citing that case, a Denver County judge ruled that the city s urban camping ban is unconstitutional, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment. ) In 2015, Denver Homeless Out Loud staged a direct action in Sustainability Park, a historic low income housing space that sat vacant for over 20 years after housing was torn down by the city. They quickly set up 10 tiny homes. Within 12 hours, police raided the area, arresting 10 people and destroying the site. In 2016, the Alternative Solutions Advocacy Project, a broader coalition, was created under the leadership of the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado. We started to get some traction, says Chandler. The coalition brought together advocates, service providers, people on the street, academics, the faith community and business leaders. The Urban Land Conservancy offered a piece of land and the Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) was formed. In July 2017, Beloved Community Village, the city s first tiny home community, opened with its first 11 homes built through grassroots organizing and over 400 volunteers. The city s zoning and permitting laws created barriers for the project. Most of the city is restricted to single unit or two unit zoning, and the tiny homes at Beloved Community Village don t have running water or sewer, preventing them from existing under standard building codes. It s not what the city would consider a dwelling unit, says Chandler. The 8 by 12 foot dormitory style units were built in a hub and spoke community design with a central shower facility. The village currently uses portable toilets and is building a new community building that will provide lockers, private bathrooms with showers, a kitchen and eating area. A widely accepted industry definition identifies a tiny house as a dwelling that is 500 square feet or less and they ve been made popular by HGTV, while providing options for affordable housing throughout the country. Beloved Community Village is adding another nine units, bringing the project to a total of 20 homes. The village and infrastructure costs approximately 600,000 in the city of Denver, much more affordable than a traditional shelter. According to Aldo s Restoration and Construction in Charlotte, a local tiny home builder, the average price of a tiny home is 25,000, approximately 10 times cheaper than the average price of building a typical home. In 2018, Charlotte City Council weighed the options for tiny houses prompted by the proposed Keyo Park West development in the Coulwood neighborhood. According to the Charlotte Business Journal, the project, which later fell through and resulted in several lawsuits, prompted a discussion by city planning staff about how tiny homes would fit within current local and state building and zoning codes, including whether a new overlay district for neighborhood conservation would be pursued a motion that ultimately was tabled. In a Transportation Planning Committee meeting on Feb. 19, 2018, Charlotte City Council Member Tariq Bakhari (District 6) stated So the crux of the decision of this Committee and ultimately the full Council needs to come to is do we want to change anything that would prohibit or put some requirements around this, and I assume that would lead to what are the reasons why? Obviously affordable house (sic) is a big deal, and this seems like a very innovative solution for it. In what scenarios of affordable housing may we want to make this easier to do? The Beloved Community Village was made possible by an ordinance passed by Denver City Council, carving out a space in the city s existing zoning and building codes. The update allowed for tiny home village permits that last up to 180 days, with a chance for renewal. Leadership in Community Planning Development believed in the vision and was really willing to work to figure out a solution to make this viable, says Polly Kyle, senior aide for Denver City Councilwoman Robin Kniech. In Denver, Chandler, Kniech and others sought ways to activate vacant city land or land that was already scheduled for development. Both land acquisition and land availability were cited challenges in a 2016 Charlotte Mecklenburg Strategies for Affordable Housing Development report. Land acquisition costs were cited as one of the largest barriers for building affordable housing especially in higher income communities and along transit corridors. It can also be complicated to find opportunity for multifamily properties in neighborhoods traditionally zoned for single family. Eight four percent of residential land in Charlotte is zoned for single family homes, but there s growing momentum that could bring changes allowing for more options in the city s traditional neighborhoods. The tiny homes at Beloved Community Village are built on jack stands, previously cement foundation blocks, so they are easy to move. Vacant land that has been cleared for future development provides an opportunity to utilize the land while necessary planning and permitting is completed. The former site of CVC s first project was developed into a 16 story market rate apartment building causing them to move to its current location in Globeville, which is leased by the city to CVC for 10 a year. According to Kyle, the city s Housing an Inclusive Denver plan is working to build and preserve affordable housing, and the city continues to look at group living ordinances to allow for more options. A vocal supporter of the project, Councilwoman Kniech pushed forward for a legal path for villages to expand and get services, pulling temporary tiny homes out of the group living process and passing a new ordinance in October 2019 that would expedite the process. In the last budget cycle, they secured an additional 125,000 in the city budget to connect villagers to permanent housing. Intentional Community The first year of Beloved Community Village was a success for residents and neighbors alike, despite initial community pushback. According to the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, The Village had no negative impacts on the neighborhood and people who live in the village are more stable. Daniel Brisson, from Denver University Graduate School of Social Work, describes it as intentional community. The Village is built around the concept of shared governance where residents decide who moves in and create rules for the community. In doing so, residents build relationships and skills around a consensus model. Dorothy Leyba is a Village Organizer for CVC and provides individual support to villagers while building community outside the village. She sees how the setup helps build advocacy, personal pride and leadership skills within the village. Residents must follow six basic community agreements: 1. No violence. 2. No weapons. 3. No illegal drugs. 4. No discriminatory behavior. 5. No continuously disruptive behavior. 6. Participation in community. During the first year, five villagers moved out three into permanent housing and two being expelled for violating the agreements. While touring the Beloved Community Village, villagers go about their daily chores. One villager meets with a case manager while sounds of construction on the new community house and additional tiny homes roars ahead. Villagers regularly go in and out of each other s homes, connecting with each other and truly living as a family unit. This is one of the most diverse communities that you ll see, says Chandler. People don t generally opt into diversity. Of the 22 residents we ve had, three have been transgender and a significant portion of the population have been people of color. It s people of all ages, people from all over the country and all education levels, too. That s not what a typical neighborhood looks like. One in five transgender people in the United States has been discriminated against when seeking a home, and more than one in 10 have been evicted from their homes because of their gender identity. Homelessness is a critical issue with one in five transgender people experiencing homelessness at some point in their lives, in large part because of familial or employment discrimination. One of the community partners of CVC is the Delores Project, which houses adult women and transgender people that are facing homelessness. The shelter is part of a larger project in partnership with the affordable housing developer Rocky Mountain Communities, which together own and operate an entire city block built with Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Arroyo Village. The block includes the shelter as well as 35 units of low income permanent supportive housing and 95 units of affordable housing for individuals and families in the workforce. The space is specifically designed for people with trauma history in mind, with large southern facing windows, plants, wood features, and soothing colors and textiles. Delores Project offers case management, life skills training, housing stability programming and emergency beds for people being released from incarceration. The goal is to move people from homelessness to stable housing. Within their first two visits, they re writing up a housing plan, says Emily Wheeland, program director at Delores Project. Former Beloved Community Village resident Silla Wolfe interviewed in The Right to Rest, a film by Sarah Megyesy and Guillermo Roques. Wolfe is one of 3 transgender residents to have lived at Beloved Community Village The area around the Delores Project is quickly gentrifying and it is the only overnight shelter in the city that is open and celebratory of transgender individuals, serving anyone that identifies along the transgender spectrum and including features like single use restrooms, private shower stalls and changing facilities. About 10 percent of the people we see self identify as trans, says Wheeland. We see a lot of folks that come from other states that we re the nearest big city to the west, that are coming from smaller towns or states that might not be as trans friendly as Denver is. A Place To Call Home I understand what it s like for people to have something they can call their own to have a key, and to have that security and that sense of empowerment, really means a lot to people, says Freddie Martin. It really makes a big difference. I never really felt like a real part of a community before. People here are amazingly open and caring and honest. The people here have been through things. They understand what suffering is. I ve always had people in my life that don t necessarily understand suffering, so it s hard for them to contend with people who are suffering, but that s one of the wonderful things about this place. People have been through things, and they re grateful for what they have. In theory, Beloved Community Village can be a unique stepping stone for people utilizing shelter services at places like the Delores Project before moving on to more permanent housing, be it shared apartments or affordable housing. We have a lot to learn about how to make this the most successful place it can be, says Chandler. This is a different emergent kind of thing. This is not a silver bullet. This is what happens when a community comes together to address a big problem. One of the things that came out of that first study was we took a vacant lot that was right across the street from a light rail station a place with a lot of activity and no eyes on the street says Chandler discussing a study by the Denver University s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. We put the village there, and crime actually decreased in the direct blocks surrounding it. That s not something that people expect, but activating a vacant lot is a valuable thing. I see the potential of this village. I want to see it expand. I want to see more villages. It s not permanent housing, but it is a stepping stone for our villagers to get permanent housing. Colorado Village Collaborative is working on creating a transgender inclusive women s village and will start a community engagement plan to find the right site this year. They would like to build 15 additional homes with a shared community space like the new one being constructed at Beloved Community. Chandler brings up the idea of tiny home villages in every city council district across Denver. On a consistent basis, the city has around 600 people living in unsheltered homelessness on any given night. Could we essentially achieve a functional zero in terms of that population by offering a humane solution that is scattered around the city. Wheeland from the Delores Project talks about changing the entire philosophy of serving those who face homelessness. By providing housing first and then continuing services like community support, mental health and life skills training after they have some type of housing stability will allow for greater impact in the community. The ultimate goal is housing, right? So, the pathway sometimes does look like they re going into a tiny home for two years. They re going into some transitional housing, before they re moving into permanent housing. It just starts by building relationships and seeing people that are struggling as our neighbors and as our family, and finding that compassion in our hearts, says Chandler. This is a seed of what the world could be.

Globeville,"From Denver Indian Health driving to New Mexico for doses, to Clinica Tepeyac applying to be a community vaccine site, local clinics are rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine Clinics in Denver that primarily serve people of color are having varied experiences when it comes to obtaining and distributing COVID 19 vaccines. Only one clinic that Denverite spoke to has so gotten doses for its patients, and another said it was waiting to get more information from the state about providing doses to its clients. COVID 19 cases in Denver continue to disproportionally affect people of color, especially Black and Latinos residents. Statewide figures show a similar discrepancy. One of the ways the city has tried to address these discrepancies is by opening free testing sites in historically underserved neighborhoods. But a special focus on these communities may not necessarily factor into the city s developing vaccine plan, said Cali Zimmerman, an emergency management coordinator with the city s public health department. Zimmerman said over email that at some point during the vaccine rollout plan s third phase, which will begin in the summer and will provide vaccinations for the general public, the city may be able provide vaccines specifically in historically underserved communities. Zimmerman said the city is getting its vaccine allocations from the state. Right now, the state gets to decided where most of the vaccines go, but Zimmerman said that in the future, individual health departments will be able to make that call. She said she did not know when that transition would happen. Karen Hoffman, a nurse practitioner and primary care director at the Denver Indian Health and Family Services clinic, said her office got its first vaccine dosages, from Pfizer, about two weeks ago from the Indian Health Services, a federal agency. As of Dec. 20, Native Americans make up 0.3 percent of all cases in Denver and comprise 0.4 percent of the city s population. Hoffman said someone from the clinic had to drive to Albuquerque to pick up the vaccines (the clinic is overseen by a regional office in New Mexico). They were given enough to vaccinate a third of their staff. She got her vaccine on Dec. 17. The clinic will start vaccinating patients this week, with the Moderna vaccine. It s expecting another shipment of these vaccines this week. Because the COVID 19 vaccines are new, anyone who gets one will have to be monitored for a short time afterward. Hoffman said the clinic will prioritize people who are 65 years of age and older. She noted the clinic is still figuring out how many people will get vaccinated during the first round but that the clinic is considering requiring appointments. Hoffman said the clinic has about 2,000 patients. We re not a clinic that has 5,000 patients that are going to be vaccinated, Hoffman said, so, you know, a hundred doses will make a big difference for us. And so we re excited. We re really excited about it. Clinica Tepeyac CEO Jim Garcia said its entire clinical staff 23 people including doctors, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants and medial assistants will get the vaccine starting Saturday through a partnership with Denver Health. Garcia said the clinic, which primarily serves Latinos and immigrant patients in the metro area, will be applying with the state s health department to become a vaccine provider. The state requires vaccine providers to be credentialed or licensed. Garcia said it will likely be several weeks before patients can get a COVID 19 vaccine at its clinic, which is located in Globeville. He said the clinic still needs to figure out logistics, like how to keep vaccines that require ultra cold storage. Garcia said there s skepticism among Latinos about the vaccines, including hesitation that existed before the pandemic about providing personal information to a healthcare provider that could jeopardize a person s immigration status. From a privacy standpoint, there s that level of concern that s starting to bubble up, Garcia said, adding people have concerns about side effects from the vaccine as well. He said a survey of Clinica s staff showed about 70 percent are comfortable getting a COVID 19 vaccine. Denver Public Health Director Dr. Bill Burman this month gave a presentation about the vaccine to the staff, which Garcia said gave workers an opportunity to ask questions. Deidre Johnson, CEO and Executive Director at the The Center for African American Health, said that despite their name, they are not a clinic and won t be providing vaccines. But similarly to Clinica Tepeyac, Johnson said she and her staff will focus on getting vaccine information to the people they serve. Johnson said that African American residents as also hesitant about vaccines, due to generations of mistreatment from medical professionals and the federal government. I want us to have something that is culturally response to our community, Johnson said, adding that messaging would also target certain age groups. "
Globeville,"Here's What 2021 Could Bring to the Denver Dining Scene click to enlarge Street Food will be big in 2021, including La Esquina Del Sabor in Aurora. Mark Antonation click to enlarge Havana Street is a great place to find new restaurants, such as Portico or Seoul Mandoo, which made these dumplings. Mark Antonation click to enlarge Chef Dave Hadley started his own samosa company in 2020, and 2021 could lead to expansion. Mark Antonation Now that we've put 2020 to bed (too bad we couldn't smother it with a pillow), it's time to start thinking about brighter days ahead. Things will still be tough for the restaurant industry in 2021, since the rollout of vaccinations will be slow and large gatherings will likely be limited for at least the first half of the new year. But warmer weather and relaxed COVID restrictions should get Denver diners out of their hibernation dens and back onto patios and into restaurant dining rooms by summer. The dining rooms that have survived the pandemic, that is. In order to survive, restaurants will still have to work hard and do plenty of rejiggering of old business models to take a post COVID economy into account. But in the meantime, the news that dining rooms can reopen on a limited level in metro Denver got the year off to a brighter start than it might have had otherwise maybe the annual January to March restaurant doldrums won't seem quite as bad this year. Here are five other predictions for Denver's food and restaurant scene for 2021:While many people will continue to feel apprehensive about sharing indoor space with strangers, Coloradans have proven willing to take dining outdoors. Last summer saw a proliferation of outdoor markets, pop ups and food truck gatherings in previously untapped locations, and the trend should only increase with a sunny spring. Last fall, newcomer Oh Golly Dumplings sprang up at multiple locations, including the Alley at the Dairy Block, Pony Up and the Way Back, and in Aurora, the Esquina Del Sabor food truck group at the corner of Chambers Road and East Colfax Avenue added a wide variety of Latin American eats. Night Market was a favorite, too, serving street food and peddling locally made products at Fort Greene in Globeville and other locations. Look for more unique and innovative offerings at farmers' markets, bars, suburban rec centers, plazas and other public spaces in 2021. And keep an eye out for brick and mortar eateries cooking on their patios, adding walk up windows and spilling out into the streets. Sadly, scores of vacant restaurant spaces sit unused because so many businesses shuttered in 2020, while other empty spots from previous years' eatery closings went unclaimed. The result is a big inventory of available space for rent, and the Denver restaurant scene abhors a vacuum. As the economy improves, young and energetic chefs and restaurateurs will jump in, many of them hungry for work after months of being unemployed. But money will be tight, so we may not see the gleaming finishes and high end furnishings that have marked lavish openings over the past several years. Instead, look back to the Great Recession of 2009 and 2010, when entrepreneurs built their dreams from reclaimed materials, beetle kill pine and elbow grease. And rather than indulge in flights of fancy, kitchens will turn out the foods that make us feel warm and safe but aren't necessarily easy to replicate at home. Will that lead to more fried chicken, pizza and burritos? Probably, but creative thinkers will breathe new life into familiar foods like Danger Zone Calzones , which converted a Broadway storefront into an homage toThe calzone specialist opened its doors today, January 4, giving us fun and entertaining things to look forward to in its new location at 32 Broadway, while continuing to schedule appearances with the Danger Zone food truck. Many vacant restaurant spaces are in the suburbs, where rent is cheaper and immigrant communities have settled. That's where you'll already find great food from all over the world, but more international eateries will open in 2021 as recent arrivals from Southeast Asia, Africa and China look to feed their communities while offering something new in the city. Portico Eritrean and Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar recently opened at 1050 South Havana in Aurora, in the former home of El Jaripeo. Look for more like this in the coming months. Many chefs and other professionals in or adjacent to the restaurant industry found themselves out of work in 2020 but rather than give up, they started their own businesses making food from cottage kitchens and commissaries. One of the first was Pandemic Donuts , which began life as a delivery only doughnut bakery last April and is now in the process of moving in with Queen City Coffee Collective in Five Points. KREAM Kimchi started out as a project to hand deliver free kimchi to friends of founder Virgil Dickerson and is now a going concern that has grown by leaps and bounds. Chefs Eric Chiappetta and Dave Hadley launched Minga Provisions and the Samosa Shop , respectively, and pasta delivery companies such as Fantasioso Foods and Casa Crobu also debuted, giving folks stuck at home ready to cook alternatives to takeout food. Will we find some of these products on grocery store shelves in 2021? It would be great to see more locally made food products next to national brands. The State of Colorado's color coded COVID dial doesn't leave much room for watering holes that don't serve food or haven't found a way to partner with food trucks, neighboring restaurants or other food producers. Bars with no form of food service can't open under current Level Red or Orange restrictions, and even as we slide into Yellow and Blue, they will not be able to open. It's not until we hit Level Green (or Protect Our Neighbors, the lightest level of restrictions) that bars can reopen at 50 percent capacity. Why? ""We don't want Colorado to become a mecca of nightlife in the pandemic,"" said Governor Jared Polis back in June. And while some of us are perfectly content sipping whiskey sodas solo in a half empty dive bar, most drinking establishments exist for the purpose of socializing and socializing will be one of the last milestones of a return to normal.

Globeville,"Corporate citizenship is more than a smart business move You ve probably heard the phrase corporate citizenship generally defined as a company s responsibilities toward society. But have you ever wondered what it really means or why it matters? These are questions I think about frequently. Data indicates that social and ethical governance is good for business. Companies with a reputation for social responsibility boast higher valuations. And a strong, ethical reputation can reduce staff turnover by up to 50 percent saving time and money that would otherwise be spent on hiring and training replacements. But it s not just about business. It s about people. I believe it is our responsibility to empower the communities we serve. We apply our experience to support the communities where we live and work, providing grants to local and national organizations, helping families who need medical support, promoting physical activity and investing in affordable housing, food security and other social factors that impact people s health. Beyond that, helping others is incredibly rewarding, and a way to remind ourselves why we do the work we do. Commitment to the Community The coronavirus pandemic is pushing America into a mental health crisis and, unfortunately, it s hitting Coloradoans hard. According to a report by Mental Health America, Colorado has the third highest rate of mental illness in the country. Moreover, Colorado is worse than most states when it comes to treating those who need help, especially in rural areas. In November 2019, the United Health Foundation (UHF) made a three year, 1.5 million grant commitment to The Colorado Center for Nursing Excellence to recruit and support 39 currently employed rural nurse practitioners as they return to graduate school and earn a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner certificate. Western Slope Nurse Practitioner Amy Leibli is one of the 39 clinicians working toward certification. I ve seen a tremendous increase in behavioral health needs in my community due to the COVID pandemic, says Leibli. Many of my patients are struggling with the isolation and lack of socialization. And, Colorado Center for Nursing Excellence President Ingrid Johnson called the collaboration with United Health Foundation critical to expanding access to much needed behavioral health care services in rural and underserved communities. UnitedHealthcare also looks at bigger picture ways to make a difference, because we know that social factors, such as having access to safe and affordable housing, have a huge impact on a person s overall health and wellbeing. With that in mind, our entire enterprise has made affordable housing a priority and in June reached the 500 million mark in affordable housing investments. In Denver, our investment of 14.7 million in housing tax credits paved the way for The Elisabetta, the new 91 unit affordable housing development in the Globeville neighborhood that offers unique services for the disabled. A few years prior to that in Fort Collins, UnitedHealthcare made a 13 million investment to provide affordable senior housing through the 72 unit Legacy Senior Residences. Our Denver based health plan has also taken a special interest in promoting outdoor play and exercise to local school children and build an interest in becoming active adults. For some children, the limitation can be as basic as the lack of warm clothes for outdoor play during the fall and winter months. UnitedHealthcare has committed to providing winter coats each fall and bicycles and helmets each spring to underprivileged kids, partnering with local school systems and Denver Broncos players who inspire these kids to dream big, focus on their education and enjoy being physically active. Over the last 4 years, we ve provided more than 1,000 new coats and 300 new bicycles to children around Denver. These simple things a bicycle to ride in the summer and a proper coat for the winter are key to getting kids outside. Finally, UnitedHealthcare of Colorado is also a strong supporter of the UnitedHealthcare Children s Foundation (UHCCF), which provides families with seriously ill or disabled children with medical grants to pay out of pocket costs not covered by their commercial health plan, no matter which insurance carrier they have. Last year, we hosted an event that raised 80,000, giving a Colorado Springs family the means to pay for multiple surgeries for their son to correct his bilateral cleft lip and pallet. UnitedHealthcare and other organizations that provide critical services are being called upon to dig deeper and do more during challenging times. We must continue to step up to meet the need. I am proud of the hard work we are doing to support our Colorado communities as they experience a greater need than ever before. Marc Neely is the CEO of UnitedHealthcare of Colorado and Wyoming. "
Farville,"Top 8 headlines of 2020 JONESBORO, Ark. (KAIT) 2020 was a busy year in Region 8 and nationwide, especially with the COVID 19 pandemic. However, Region 8 News took a look at some of the other big stories of the year: An EF 3 tornado ripped through Jonesboro on March 28, damaging businesses and homes from the South Caraway Road area to the Farville Curve area. The storm ripped the roof and leveled part of the Mall at Turtle Creek that day. The mall has yet to fully reopen. As first responders worked to assess the damage, they set a command post up at the mall. That s when you saw people from all over pitch in to help. You know that was, that was one of the most humbling experiences, to say the least, Craighead Co. Judge Marvin Day said. When you, when you look up and you realize how great a community that we live in. Our second story, the disappearance and the murder of a young Jackson County woman. Sydney Sutherland disappeared after going out for a jog in August. Days later, Region 8 News learned she had been kidnapped, raped and killed. Her accused killer Quake Lewellyn was charged in this case. The gruesome crime rocked the community, including Jackson County Sheriff David Lucas. I m alright. It s a job. I do my job. I ll have time to reflect once the job is done, Sheriff Lucas said. Our third story brings us to Randolph County, where the woman accused of killing Former State Senator Linda Collins pleaded guilty. In August, Rebecca O Donnell told Judge John Fogleman she intentionally killed Collins in her home, back on June 2019 and hid the body. He sentenced her to 50 years in prison, bringing closure to her family. Today we find some shred of peace that Rebecca O Donnell will be put away in prison for a very long time, unable to hurt anyone else, Collins daughter, Tate Williams, said. An Izard County cold case was solved this year. The man accused of killing Rebekah Gould was arrested in Oregon. Investigators say William Miller was visiting from Texas in 2004 when he killed Gould and dumped her body of off Highway 9, just south of Melbourne. Hopefully this will provide some closure to family, Izard Co. Sheriff Jack Yancey said. A lot of times, just the not knowing is a terrible burden to carry around. His trial is set for August 25. Newport Police Lt. Patrick Weatherford s family in Newport got news this year as well. The man accused of of killing the officer in 2017 pleaded guilty in October 2020. He was a juvenile at the time of his offenses but he was charged as an adult. Court documents say he confessed to the shooting and he was sentenced to 42 years in prison. An elected official was indicted in 2020 for wire fraud. He had created a system to do this, Craighead Co. Judge Day said. Craighead County Clerk Kade Holliday is accused of stealing over 1.4 million in county funds for his personal gain. The investigation tied up at least two businesses: Twisted Foods and The Edge Coffee House and Eatery. Two days after Holliday s arrest, the Northeast Arkansas Business Leadership Council also accused him of stealing between 15,000 to 20,000 as the de facto treasurer. He pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of wire fraud earlier this month. A push for change also dominated the year. No justice. No peace, chanted many back in June on South Caraway Road in Jonesboro. Citizens spent days protesting after the death of George Floyd while in custody in Minneapolis. We heard from people in your communities say why they were marching. I had a family member get shot by a police officer and it touched the family hard. George touched home and I feel like he was one of my family members, one man said. Citizens pushed the community, local and state officials to make changes in policing and face the truth about social injustices. In Paragould, Police Chief Todd Stovall joined the crowd and even took a knee. In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created the Task Force to Advance the State of Law Enforcement to look at what could be improved. The group turned in their recommendations for law enforcement agencies in the state earlier this month. The body of a woman missing for years was found in October. Lisa Prescott disappeared in September 2018 and she didn t meet the requirements of a Silver Alert. That s why the family searched themselves. It wasn t until 17 days after she disappeared they were able to organize a large search with help from EquuSearch and Jonesboro police. Ultimately, finding her body over two years later. The family says they know there are so many questions left with a lot of speculation floating around on this case. Copyright 2020 KAIT. All rights reserved. "

Gainsville,"Intercity bus line coming to Martinsville The Virginia Breeze bus company recently made a big announcement in time for the business s second anniversary. Starting this year, it will offer lines from Martinsville to Richmond and from Danville to Washington, D. C. Part of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation, Virginia Breeze is an intercity bus service that connects commuters from place to place. It is funded entirely through the federal Rural Transit Assistance 5311 Program and ticket revenues. Virginia Breeze currently connects Blacksburg with Union Station in Washington, D. C. The existing route includes several stops in the New River Valley, Shenandoah Valley and Northern Virginia. Jessica Cowardin, the public relations and marketing specialist with the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation, expressed that plans for additional Virginia Breeze routes started taking shape shortly following the company s initial launch. Based on a study in 2013, DRPT launched the original route between Blacksburg, Virginia, and Washington D. C. in 2017, Cowardin said. The Commonwealth quickly realized the success of this route and decided to explore other possible opportunities in Virginia with another study, which wrapped up in 2019. DRPT is now in the process of making those potential routes a reality. While particulars concerning bus stops and stations along the upcoming routes are still in the works, the company released a proposed route for each of the new lines. Buses on the approximately 250 mile route from Danville to Union Station will travel along U. S. Route 29 and Interstate 66, including potential stops in pre established Virginia Breeze locations like Lynchburg, Charlottesville and at Dulles International Airport. Additional stops along the Danville to D. C. route could include Altavista, Amherst, Lexington, Culpeper, Warrenton and Gainsville. Busses along the approximately 190 mile route between Martinsville and Richmond will travel on an entirely new route for the company, which plans to create potential bus stops in Danville, South Boston, Hampden Sydney and Farmville. The major perk is that these are not just regional connections, but national connections that tie into the national bus network, Cowardin said. Exact routing and stop locations for both lines are still in development. Our goal is to ensure that all Virginians, regardless of where they live, have access to safe, affordable and reliable transportation,"" said Jennifer Mitchell, director of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation. ""Virginians have shown immense support for the Virginia Breeze, with ridership increasing year over year. "" First launched in December 2017, the Virginia Breeze served 20,686 riders in 2018. Virginia Breeze ridership data shows the service carried 6,511 passengers in the third quarter of 2019 a 28% increase over the second quarter of 2018. The routes provide traveling opportunities for those commuting for business, schooling, vacation and many other reasons. Having a trained bus driver familiar with the route and traffic patterns takes stress off of individual drivers they no longer have to worry about weaving through hundreds of cars, depending on spotty GPS signals in rural areas and finding a good place to fill up on gasoline it s all taken care of for them. Virginia Breeze buses include roomy seating, a restroom, baggage storage, free Wi Fi and in seat power outlets. While exact numbers aren t yet available for the new Martinsville and Danville lines, Virginia Breeze fares currently range from 15 to 50. We are hoping for a launch in late spring 2020, Cowardin said.

Gainsville,"‘Here we are, like defenseless caged animals:’ At rally, gun advocates vow to oppose new laws The rally s official program included about an hour of speeches on Capitol Square from elected state officials and other gun rights supporters before demonstrators filed out peacefully into the streets. Many thanked police on the way out. Del. Nick Freitas, R Culpeper, a congressional candidate seeking the GOP nomination to challenge U. S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D Henrico, thanked the crowd for showing up despite the spread of information meant to scare and intimidate rallygoers. The next time they tell you that the government is responsible for your security, just remind them that it was the government that was protecting Jeffrey Epstein. Who, by the way, didn t kill himself, Freitas said, closing his speech with a reference to the high profile financier who was facing charges of sexually abusing dozens of women and girls when he died in his cell last year under mysterious circumstances. The death was ruled a suicide. Freitas was endorsed during the event by Gun Owners of America, a group that works with Virginia Citizens Defense League. One of his Republican opponents, Del. John McGuire, R Goochland, spoke shortly thereafter, telling the crowd he had introduced a bill that would allow Virginians to sue the government if they get shot in a gun free zone. I don t understand what part of shall not be infringed they don t understand, McGuire said. Stephen Willeford, a Texas man who used an AR 15 to disrupt the 2017 mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, told the crowd that Americans have three boxes they can use to protect their rights: the soap box, the ballot box and the cartridge box. Let s hope that we are generations away from using the cartridge box, Willeford said. Because it s a last ditch moment. Two Virginia law enforcement officers Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins and York County Sheriff Danny Diggs were also included in the speaker lineup. Jenkins reiterated his vow to deputize thousands of Culpeper residents if necessary to protect them from new gun laws and urged attendees to pressure their local officials to go beyond passing symbolic pro gun resolutions. It s time for all those counties to now go to their sheriffs, their commonwealth s attorneys and ask them to stand firm and state where do we stand on this line, Jenkins said. Noting the revolutionary history of York County, Diggs said Virginia is now faced with tyranny again. The governor and the Democrats have ignored the Constitution and trampled on our rights, Diggs said. He has even disarmed law enforcement officers here today, telling us that it s to keep us safe. Yet here we are, like defenseless caged animals. All of the gun bills Democrats are pushing exist in other states. Some, like the red flag law Florida enacted in the wake of the Parkland massacre, have stood up to constitutional challenges. In the landmark Heller case, the U. S. Supreme Court said firearm regulation and the Second Amendment are not incompatible. Meanwhile, outside the rally, a protester carrying an assault style rifle and wearing military style clothing said he was there to stand up for his rights, because if you don t use them you lose them. The man wouldn t give his name. He grew up around guns, he said, and doesn t see this protest as part of a movement, since gun rights are already enshrined in the Constitution. He drove about 10 hours from Tennessee. They re not as treasonous in Tennessee, said a man next to him, who wouldn t give his name either. Lynn Kasic owns a gun range in West Virginia but lives in Gainsville, Va. She is a firm support of the 2nd Amendment, she says, and the current government has gone far beyond any reasonable measures. She says the government should start with enforcing any laws they currently have and addressing issues of mental illness, which is the root cause of most mass shootings. She is not worried about violence at the rally, and says that gun owners are live and let live people. READ MORE ABOUT THE GUN RIGHTS RALLY ON THE VIRGINIAMERCURY.

Gainsville,"Evansville police hope to get facial recognition software in 'years to come' | Webb Two men got into a fight. One stabbed the other in the stomach. Luckily, someone recording nearby captured the attack on video. They handed the footage to Indiana State Police, and within 20 minutes the alleged stabber was in custody. That quick arrest was possible thanks to Clearview AI. And according to a New York Times story released over the weekend, it may end privacy as we know it. Clearview is a facial recognition app churned out by its eponymous tech company. The New York Times reported that more than 600 police forces around the country have adopted the technology in the last year. And Sgt. Nick Winsett, spokesman for the Evansville police, said EPD may soon be among them. It s something that we will hopefully be getting in the years to come, he said. Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding told me his department doesn t use any software like Clearview. More:Evansville will flood more often. And there's not much we can do about it Webb More:There's a growing problem in the opioid fight: diarrhea medication Webb The ISP example makes facial recognition sound like the next logical step in law enforcement. After all, quickly clearing the streets of at large offenders is a good thing. And what investigator wouldn t want a device that could make crimes easier to solve? Gainsville, Florida, Detective Sgt. Nick Ferrara told the Times that Clearview is huge improvement over Florida s own facial recognition database, which can t pull a match unless the offender is staring straight at the camera. With Clearview, you can use photos that aren t perfect, he said. A person can be wearing a hat or glasses, or it can be a profile shot or partial view of their face. But there are some huge problems with the technology, privacy advocates say. Even Google a company that sells eavesdropping devices for your home found Clearview s brand of facial recognition software too intrusive to pursue, the Times reported. The process Here s how it works. Let s say police somehow obtain a photo of someone in the act of allegedly committing a crime. They don t know who that person is, but with Clearview, they can toss that photo into the app s database. It then scours billions of photos posted online to find a match, raking through Facebook, YouTube and scores of other sites where we post our shining mugs day after day. It can reportedly obtain a positive match about 75 percent of the time. You can stop Clearview from accessing your Facebook account by barring your photos from search engines, CEO Hoan Ton That told the Times. That is, unless Clearview has already combed through your account. Once it does, it stores your photos indefinitely. The New York Times listed ISP as Clearview s first paying customer. A state police spokesman confirmed to the Times that they tested the app, but declined to elaborate beyond that. Police forces won t be so cagey as the years wear on. Use of Clearview and the Pepsis to its Coke that may coat tail on its success could easily expand: especially to crime stricken communities who see it as an instant fix to their problems. David Scalzo, an early investor in Clearview, told the Times it s basically pointless to oppose facial recognition. Once some kind of useful technology worms its way into society, the thinking goes, it spreads with a ferocity that would make Ebola jealous. I ve come to the conclusion that because information constantly increases, there s never going to be privacy, he said. Laws have to determine what s legal, but you can t ban technology. Sure, that might lead to a dystopian future or something, but you can t ban it. Apparently Scalzo s never been to California. A bill that banned facial recognition software in body cameras for at least three years became law there this month. And on Tuesday, despite the protests of Facebook, the Supreme Court declined to pick up a case out of Illinois, which means Facebook users there are now eligible to sue the social media giant over its use of facial recognition. It stems from a law Illinois passed a couple years ago. It requires companies to get users permission before they collect biometric data, including facial geometry, fingerprints and more. Texas has had a similar law on the books since 2009. More:Webb: A popular Google app is banned in Illinois. Is Indiana next? And at a speech in Brussels on Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai called for a moratorium on facial recognition technology until the federal government could come up with a way to regulate it. That sounds nice and all, but the feds ain t exactly the best choice when it comes to curbing mass surveillance. You can tell them that directly the next time they monitor your phone calls. Plus, take this bill introduced by Sen. Christopher Coons back in November. It would technically force federal agencies to get a court order before they tracked someone using facial recognition. But the exceptions to that are hilariously broad. The FBI could still follow someone for as much as 72 hours. And the limits would not apply to instances where facial recognition technology is utilized for a single identification or attempted identification of an individual. In other words, exactly what Clearview does. Stalking According to marketing materials the Times nabbed through a public records request, annual subscriptions for Clearview range from 10,000 to 250,000. As of now, it s only available to law enforcement. And that s where it should stay. Digital Trends talked to several women s advocates who said that if similar technology ever landed in the App Store, creeps could snap pictures of women walking down the street and know their identities within seconds. That could ramp up the possibility of staking. There s always the chance a bevy of laws will hamper the rise of facial recognition software before it becomes more commonplace. After all, Clearview's not a giant tech firm with unlimited lobbying power. . But if it does spread, law enforcement agencies must use it responsibly. Local governments should set limits on its scope, and police forces should announce to their communities exactly how they plan to utilize the technology. Then again, maybe that won t be necessary. Anytime I complain about Amazon Echos and Google Homes and Facebook Portals monitoring our every move, I usually get the same response: I don t care if they monitor me. I haven t done anything wrong. The concept of privacy has steadily dissipated over the last few years. The iPhones in our pockets listen to our conversations. Amazon gathers unprotected videos from the cameras we tack next to our doorbells. And hackers break into Wi Fi connected baby monitors to creepily tell our children I love you. And yet we keep inviting all this technology into lives. In the battle between convenience and anonymity, it s no contest at all. The New York Times worried that Clearview AI could end privacy as we know it. But if it does, would anyone care? Contact columnist Jon Webb at jon. webb courierpress. com"

The senator will have to step back from the all important election battle, just days from the election on Tuesday, January 5. On behalf of the 71 year old his campaign said, in a statement issued on Thursday: ""This morning, Senator Perdue was notified that he came into close contact with someone on the campaign who tested positive for COVID 19. ""Both Senator Perdue and his wife tested negative today, but following his doctor's recommendations and in accordance with CDC guidelines, they will quarantine. The Senator and his wife have been tested regularly throughout the campaign, and the team will continue to follow CDC guidelines. "" The announcement came 30 minutes before Perdue was due to speak at a campaign event in Gainsville, alongside Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, CNN reported. Perdue had been scheduled to join a rally with President Trump and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, on Monday, according to the AP. Battle for control of the Senate The outcome of the Georgia contest where Sen. Loeffler will also faceoff against Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock will decide which party controls the Senate. If Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock both win, Democrats will control the legislative and executive branches, allowing for Joe Biden to more easily accomplish his legislative goals. On Wednesday, Insider reported that a newly released runoff poll found that the Democratic candidates were widening their leads. The JMC poll, conducted with 500 respondents on Monday and Tuesday, found Ossoff ahead of Perdue 50% to 43%, or 7 points, with 7% of respondents saying they were undecided. The divide between Warnock and Loeffler in the poll was even larger: Warnock was ahead 53% to 44%, or 9 points, with 3% of respondents saying they were undecided. JMC is one of just a handful of pollsters participating in the Senate runoffs many of the most recognized and reputable pollsters have not conducted any polls since the general election in November. A recent survey conducted by SurveyUSA found Ossoff with a 5 percentage point lead and Warnock with a 7 point lead. And according to FiveThirtyEight's polling tracker, the margin of support has steadily increased for the Democratic candidates in polls conducted since the general election on November 3. Nick Gourevitch, a Democratic pollster with Global Strategy Group, recently told Politico that trusting the accuracy of polls in Georgia following the tumultuous presidential polling would be a mistake.

Clairsville,"Thalman Sworn In as Mayor of St. Clairsville ST. CLAIRSVILLE Kathryn Thalman marked her swearing in as the new mayor of St. Clairsville with exuberance and enthusiasm Thursday, when she took her oath of office at the J. B. Martin Recreation Center. A sizable crowd of friends, family, city employees, council members and police officers, local business owners and residents turned out to congratulate her. Thalman decisively defeated incumbent mayor Terry Pugh in a three way race on Election Day, Nov. 5. A major issue of contention was the future of water and wastewater service in the city, with Pugh s administration advocating for privatizating the systems and selling them to a state regulated entity that would make repairs and meet costly mandates from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Thalman s platform included exploring options to maintain local control of those systems. The attendees applauded after she was sworn in. I am just blown away. I am so blessed, she said after taking her oath. She thanked all in attendance and her campaign supporters for their work during the election. To everybody here who voted for me, and even if you didn t, you prayed for me and it s appreciated, she said. I m eager to work with our wonderful council. I m so excited to have the opportunity to work with them. We are going to have so much excitement, and we are going to do some wonderful things for the city. The future of water service will be on the coming agenda. First and foremost, we ll be looking at the water issues , she said, adding that the future is bright. There s going to be a lot of opportunities coming to St. Clairsville. A new day has indeed dawned. This new administration will bring open eyes and open hearts, as well as enthusiasm and energy to move St. Clairsville forward. We will view St. Clairsville with 2020 vision. We ll be pointing toward the future and respecting our past. We will prepare for the future and the economic opportunities as well as address the safety of our city, she said. Options will be explored through creativity and applying good, solid business principles. Among Thalman s initiatives is to begin walking tours through the city on Wednesdays. We ll have a chance to talk and engage with our residents and hear what concerns you have about our city, she said. Thalman also pledged there would be transparency in her administration. She added that while the campaign had been marked by anger and insults from some, particularly on social media, this did not reflect attitude of the majority of city residents. She said, 99.999 percent of the people in this town are absolutely wonderful, and I am humbled to be representing you, she said. Thalman added that she is St. Clairsville s first female mayor. That is a huge milestone for the city, and one that I embrace and will take very seriously. Thalman s upcoming duties include naming her administrative staff, department heads, a city safety and service director and a police chief. The prior police chief, Jeff Henry, retired in mid December. Lt. Mike Troullos was appointed interim chief until Thalman took office. Thalman did not comment on who would be named to the chief s position or the staff. Another ongoing issue is the proposed disciplining of a police officer, T. J. Stewart, for three reported infractions in 2019. Pugh deferred the matter to Thalman s administration and released a letter to the public outlining the case. Guests included Ohio Sen. Frank Hoagland, R Mingo Junction, who congratulated Thalman and took the opportunity to speak to her about the 2020 21 capital budget and its impact on Belmont County. Belmont County is forward thinking, and we re looking at how we can expand not only what Belmont County has to offer, but also what assets Belmont County needs to create and build, he said, adding that road and internet access improvements are some of the chief local issues. I was able to bend the mayor s ear real quick. It looks like everybody s ready to go to work. Wendy Anderson, director of the St. Clairsville Area Chamber of Commerce, said the business community was represented. We are ready for a new day, and it seems like everybody s excited about her being the first woman and the energy that she s going to bring to St. Clairsville, she said. Anderson said the mayor s walking tour plans sound promising. It s important to get out there and talk to the businesses, find out what they are feeling. Find out what the vibe s going on in town so they can identify it and work with it. It s all about business. How you talk to your businesses, Anderson said. Several council members were also present and shared in the optimism. I m here to support the new administration, just like I tried to support the former administration. I wish the new mayor all the best and will do whatever I can as a councilperson to help, Councilwoman Beth Oprisch said. We have a great future in this city, fresh ideas, and we re going to take one thing at a time and fix it, Councilman Perry Basile said. Council President Jim Velas said he looks forward to city leaders working together to address common problems. We re behind her. You have to support your local people, Joyce Paglialunga, owner of From Past to Present, said. I hope she can do a great job for us. The next council meeting is scheduled for 7:30 p. m. Monday at the city building, 100 N. Market St. "
Clairsville,"Retailer reframes industry, internal challenges Mary van Praag, who oversees intimates, including the Soma and TellTale brands, for Fort Myers based retailer Chico s FAS, spends a portion of every day scrolling on her phone. Not down the social media rabbit hole, but for something vital to the Chico s unit she oversees: net promoter score. The voice of the customer is very important, says van Praag, who came to the Fort Myers retailer in September 2017, after leadership roles at cosmetics and health care products companies, including Coty and Johnson Johnson. We want a 10 from everybody. 10 for 20 Company: Chico s FAS, Fort Myers Executives: Mary van Praag, Molly Langenstein Why they matter: The past year at Chico s FAS, one of Southwest Florida s largest corporate employers, was dotted with hiccups, in financials and leadership. In January 2019 the publicly traded company announced plans to close some 250 stores by 2021, a strategic decision to rebalance the mix between its physical store presence with its digital network. While one brand, Soma, flourished in 2019, two bigger units posted a slide in sales, leading to a net loss of 8.4 million through the first 39 weeks of 2019, according to the firm s 2019 third quarter earnings report. On leadership, former CEO Shelly Broader, who led a different turnaround effort at Chico s FAS for nearly three years, left the company in April. The company then reorganized its top leadership structure, where now a pair of division presidents report to new CEO Bonnie Brooks: Mary van Praag, at the helm of the Intimates Group, and Molly Langenstein, in charge of apparel brands. The division president looks at the net promoter score, a survey generated ranking of survey from customers, two ways. One is an affirmation for the work the unit has done in the past two years, overcoming sales slumps and brand sameness within the industry. The second is an appeal to employees, from marketing to design to the sales floor, to maintain their newfound marketplace edge. She cites a recent trip to a Soma store in the tony Waterside Shops in Naples to prove the effort is working. There, a customer, not knowing who van Praag was, raved about both the knowledge of the saleswoman and her comforting sales approach. We have to continue to find ways to get people excited about our brand, says van Praag, named a 2019 Top Woman in Retail by Total Retail. Our goal is to provide five star service every day to every customer. That service, combined with a superior product and a revamped marketing push, van Praag says, is the intimates unit s winning formula for both e commerce and brick and mortar. She calls it Double D for both the intimates size and the mission: to double sales in the division. The unit is on its way: It posted double digit comparable sales growth in the 2019 second and third quarters, according to a company earnings report. At 11.3% in the third quarter, it was the fifth quarter of consecutive comparable sales growth, driven, according to the statement, by product innovation and inventory and marketing investments. The goal for Soma, and the newer, online only brand TellTale, van Praag says, is to create a national, top of mind brand leader and a go to place for women to feel comfortable. Soma opened its first store in Fort Myers in 2004 and now has some 300 boutiques nationwide, while TellTale was introduced in April, targeting women ages 25 40. Van Praag contrasts that approach to L Brands intimates company Victoria Secret, which, despite its brand recognition, has struggled to maintain market share amid a prolonged sales slump. Victoria s Secret was really made for men, to buy something for women, van Praag says. It wasn t made for women. I think women felt they had to compromise with intimates , and nothing has changed until Soma came along. At a glance: Chico's FAS Year Revenue percent change 2015 2.64 billion 2016 2.47 billion 6.4% 2017 2.28 billion 7.7% 2018 2.13 billion 6.5% Those Soma products, she says, represent a high barrier to entry for competitors. For one, the production cycle is 18 to 24 months, with lots of parts and pieces, van Praag says, and a complicated supply chain. Producing a bra is not for the faint of heart, she says. With products in place, the next big challenge is to get in front and stay in front of customers who have a seemingly endless array of options. To do that, van Praag has restructured parts of the Soma division, with a greater emphasis on social media and celebratory marketing initiatives. One example: a one day, 15 in store bra event in August to mark Soma s 15th anniversary. That effort, extended a day because it was so popular, brought in 60,000 new customers over two days, company officials said in the third quarter earnings release. Brand awareness is a really big thing for us right now, van Praag says. It s a parade of choices out there. You have to tell her about it. A corporate recruiter, over LinkedIn, told van Praag about an opportunity at Chico s in early 2017. Then the CEO of Perricone MD, a San Francisco anti aging skin products company, van Praag told the recruiter, You know I don t have any experience in apparel? They said, We want somebody who could build a brand. Stefania Pifferi. Molly Langenstein, left, and Mary van Praag lead divisions at Fort Myers based Chico's FAS. With what she calls a strength in leading organizations through change, turnarounds and integration, van Praag took the build a brand and career shift opportunity with Chico s and Soma. Although Soma wasn t broken, per se, van Praag says her overall mission, transforming the unit into a profitable revenue driver for Chico s, is only in its infancy. There s so much more we can tell as a brand, van Praag says. We want to bring this brand into every household in America. We want to be the bra company. Style connect Molly Langenstein knew she was going to pursue a retail career in eighth grade. That s when she watched her mom, Judy McClain, operate a clothing boutique in the small east Ohio town Langenstein grew up in, St. Clairsville. I was like the kid who always worked around the shop and pretended I knew a lot, Langenstein says. Then one day, Langenstein watched her mom find outfits for a customer who said she had no confidence in how she looked and felt. I saw how empowering it could be to provide women clothes where they really felt comfortable, she says. I wanted to do that with my own career. Langenstein followed through, starting as a buyer for Burdines. She next spent 30 years at Macy s, where she headed up several units, from the chain s millennial focused lines to overseeing the ready to wear group, a multibillion dollar business. In July 2019, Langenstein shifted directions, taking on the role of president of the apparel group at Chico s FAS. In the newly formed position under new CEO Bonnie Brooks, Langenstein replaced Karen McKibbin, who had been Chico's brand president. Langenstein oversees the Chico s and White House Black Market brands, which comprise some 1,000 stores and multiple online and omnichannel options, including Amazon and QVC. The struggles there are acute: Same store sales fell 5.8% at Chico s and 10.6% at White House Black Market in the first three quarters of 2019, through Nov 2. In a statement after joining Chico s, in the second quarter, Langenstein said the pair of entities are unique brands with the potential for growth that far exceeds what they are delivering today. I ve always gravitated toward businesses that were a little messy, that had a little bit of issues, Langenstein adds in an interview. I like fixing things. At Chico s, the fixing starts with brick and mortar, where Langenstein, after spending the summer touring multiple stores, says one of the chain s core problems is product saturation. As a retailer, when you get challenges, you end up putting out a lot of products on the floor to try and build up sales, she says. What we have to do is clear the deck and make the product the hero. You have to get rid of the clutter. Customer experience, not necessarily clutter, Langenstein says, is the core issue at White House Black Market once a niche industry leader, known for its designer details. Some of that has really fallen by the wayside, Langenstein says. To address that, as well as the issues in Chico s stores, Langenstein centers on the company s why. That takes her back to when she was a teenager, watching her mom give a customer the confidence to feel good about herself through an improved wardrobe. Delivering that kind of service for the already loyal Chico s customer base, with a mix of surprise and delight, is Langenstein s why. You have to put the why before the what, she says. On the e commerce challenge many retailers wrestle with the what to answer the company s why Langenstein says Chico's seeks to have a seamless experience bridging physical and digital. That starts with Style Connect, an online service associates use, sometimes walking around with tablets, to personalize the in store experience and track down sizes and styles. We believe Style Connect is a fantastic tool to support our clientele and educate her on how to maximize her wardrobe and outfitting ideas, Langenstein says. I ve always gravitated toward businesses that were a little messy, that had a little bit of issues. I like fixing things. Molly Langenstein, Chico s FAS In addition to Style Connect, the company recently added a buy online, pick up in store option in all brands, officials said in the company s third quarter earnings release. Taken together, Style Connect and buy online, pick up in store, according to an earlier statement, allows the firm to stay connected with eight million customers. The why before what mantra, meanwhile, goes back to Langenstein s Macy s days, when she says no decisions were approved that didn t put the customer first. With Macy s, too, the brand s success, prior to e commerce battles, at least, fueled pressure to outperform past results. Being part of an iconic brand, you were held to a higher standard, she says. There were a lot more eyes watching you. If Chico s and White House Black Market someday face that kind of pressure to replicate success, Langenstein will have done something right. Customers and Wall Street will be watching the brands closely in 2020, with competitors waiting to grab more market share if the company falters. You can t rest on your laurels, Langenstein says. Everyone in this business thinks about the same challenges and has a lot of smart people trying to solve them. To read more on the 10 top things to watch out for in 2020, click the links below. "

Clairsville,"New anchor store coming to Eastwood Mall NILES The Cafaro Company will announce Monday the national retailer that will occupy the massive former Sears, but speculation about the mall s new anchor is that it will be Boscov s department store. Neither Joe Bell, director of corporate communications for Cafaro Company , nor Jacob Stein, senior vice president of corporate communications for Boscov s, would confirm the Reading, Pa. based chain is opening a store in Niles but there are strong hints of that partnership. Cafaro Company officials plan next week to provide details of one of the biggest announcements ever made by the company regarding the mall s future, according to a news release Friday, the same day Boscov s posted a second clue to its Facebook page regarding a big announcement it plans to make Monday. Bell said the retailer has a large presence in the mid Atlantic and Northeast markets and will be the biggest retailer to open its doors inside the mall. When all is said and done, this will be in excess of 180,000 square feet, Bell said. Said Jim Boscov, chairman and CEO of Boscov s: I will give you all of the details on Monday. Demolition work has been happening inside the former Sears as crews have been removing the top nine inches of floor for asbestos, according to a permit granted Nov. 6 by the building department in Niles. The store will inhabit the 119,900 square foot space of the former Sears and more, including the 25,800 square foot Tilt Studio, which closed when its lease ended Dec. 31. In addition, several stores in that concourse will be relocated inside the mall to make way for the new retailer. They include A Nails salon, Dafffin s Candies and St. Joe s at the Mall. Boscov s operates 49 stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, according to its website. Its largest presence is in Pennsylvania, where it has 26 stores. It already has partnerships with Cafaro Company at its Ohio Valley Mall in St. Clairsville the only Boscov s in Ohio and at Mill Creek Mall in Erie, Pa. , where it occupies the former Sears. The chain opened its first store in 1918 in Reading, Pa. Four years prior, its founder, Solomon Boscov, settled in Reading from Russia and began selling household goods to farmers, according to the company s website. rselak tribtoday. com"
Clairsville,"Help guide change — Get involved in community It s time for change in Eastern Ohio. In many communities across our region, transitions of leadership are taking place. With the first of the year, new mayors, council members and other local officials are taking office. In some cases, these changes are happening because sitting officials decided to step aside. In others, heated contests led to the removal of an incumbent and their replacement with someone new. The village of Belmont celebrated its transition on Saturday, as explained in an article on the front page of today s edition. Residents, officials and people from nearby communities turned out to thank outgoing mayor Stan Sobel for his service and they congratulated new Mayor Ron Woods and wished him well in his term. Sobel, as he had pledged when elected, served just one term. But during that time he accomplished a great deal. The mayor of nearby Bethesda was on hand at the party Saturday to extend her best wishes to Sobel and Woods. Samantha Burkhead, like Woods, is new to her office. She replaces another mayor who decided it was time for him to step aside, Martin Lucas. He served his community for several years as a councilman and mayor. The situation is similar in Yorkville, where incumbent mayor Karen Vargo decided it was time for her to retire. Fire Chief Dana Brown defeated council President Sandy Reasbeck in the November race to replace her. Both of the cities in Belmont County now have new mayors as well. In Martins Ferry, incumbent Robert Krajnyak lost a bid for re election to challenger John Davies. Both men have served the city in the past in various capacities. I, personally, have covered Martins Ferry City Council when each of them was a member, and I believe both have the best interest of the city at heart. St. Clairsville swore in its first female mayor last week when Kathryn Thalman took office. She prevailed in a heated contest that started out as a four way race. Incumbent Terry Pugh sought to hold onto his seat, but he faced challenges from Thalman along with resident Bill Brooks and then council president Tim Porter. Porter dropped out of the race and then resigned his council seat after a recording of him using a racial slur and profanity was released to the media. Plenty of other changes are taking place across the region as political bodies reorganize for 2020. With the start of a new year and a new decade, community leaders are reevaluating priorities, setting goals and making plans to move ahead. Although it may seem that these people have a great deal of power and authority over their neighbors, that generally is not the reason that they choose to serve. In my experience, most people who step up to the plate and take on the challenge of serving in public office do so because they want to make a difference. In St. Clairsville, for example, the question of privatizing the water and wastewater systems drove the politics of the past few months. Brooks opposed privatization while Pugh advocated for it. Thalman took the approach that more information is needed before the right decision can be made. Several years ago, I served as a council member in Belmont. I did not run for election instead, I was appointed to fill a vacant seat. During my term, I weighed in on hiring decisions, policy changes, donations, budgetary matters and much more. I did so because I felt that my community needed me. After all, someone has to give their time and energy to making these decisions. If you have never served in public office, I urge you to consider doing so even if only for a single term. Public service and participation at the ballot box are the things that make our system work. Now is the time to start thinking about whether you can and have the desire to become a public official. This year, Ohio will hold its primary on March 17. While the presidential contest will be the big draw, plenty of other contests will be decided as well. In order to be on that ballot, even as a write in candidate, you must file paperwork with your county board of elections by 4 pm. Monday. To participate in March voting, you must register to vote by Feb. 18. Visit the Ohio Secretary of State s website sos. state. oh. us if you need to check your registration status. If you have no desire to hold office, or if you simply can t do so right now, there are still plenty of ways you can help and support your new community leaders and your community as a whole. You can start by attending a council meeting. After you ve been to one such session, I urge you to keep going back. Councils and administrations can benefit from the input of the people they serve. They also need to recruit volunteers, committee members and others to help ensure projects get completed. They also can use help in getting the word out to your neighbors who do not attend. The decisions made in your villages, cities, townships and counties each month likely have much more direct impact on you and your family than do many at the state and federal levels. For that reason, I encourage you to become informed and to get involved in whatever capacity works for you right now. "
Clairsville,"St. C. police discipline matter goes public ST. CLAIRSVILLE A disciplinary matter within the St. Clairsville Police Department spilled over into public view last week when the outgoing mayor released a letter addressed to Officer T. J. Stewart. The matter will be decided by newly sworn in Mayor Kathryn Thalman, though it originated under the previous administration. On Monday, outgoing mayor Terry Pugh released to the media a letter addressed to Stewart. It details a pre disciplinary hearing held Dec. 27 before Safety and Service Director Jim Zucal, who reportedly found there was sufficient reason for Stewart to be disciplined. In St. Clairsville, it is the mayor s responsibility to impose discipline. The letter refers to three apparent infractions, first alleging that Stewart engaged in personal business while on the job for about 45 minutes before being caught by then police chief Jeff Henry and ordered to go back on patrol. A second infraction reportedly occurred when a resident approached Stewart and told the officer he had been the victim of an assault. Stewart allegedly failed to conduct an investigation or make a report. I cannot express to you how disturbed I am that you would fail to take any action when a resident reports a possible crime to you, Pugh wrote to Stewart. In the third incident, Stewart allegedly left his shift four hours early without notifying other on duty officers. Pugh added that Stewart had received approximately seven prior reprimands in the past three years for such infractions as not completing reports, leaving windows down in his patrol car and not filing documents with the courts in a timely manner. Pugh said Stewart also received a two week suspension in 2018 that was later reduced to a four day suspension after arbitration. Pugh said Stewart later received a 30 day suspension as well. Pugh also wrote that Stewart made false statements during polygraph examinations. Pugh concluded that since the mayoral administration was about to change and after a phone call from Thalman that he described as very demanding he would honor her request to defer any imposition of discipline to her. Interim Police Chief Mike Troullos declined to comment on the matter. Troullos was appointed interim chief after Henry retired in mid December. Thalman s administration will appoint a permanent chief. Gwen Callender, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council, issued a statement about the matter on Friday. Stewart, a 27 year veteran, has been the subject of several years of on going retaliatory and disparate treatment and discipline by members of the former city administration. The Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council Inc. has vigorously defended Officer Stewart during these allegations, she states. Callender said a neutral arbitrator recognized dysfunction and selective treatment of Stewart by Henry. She added that a review of Henry conducted last spring in a discriminatory harassment complaint investigation found Henry appeared to unjustifiably target Stewart. Henry was cleared of any wrongdoing in that investigation. Regarding the release of personnel information, Callender said, Outgoing and defeated former Mayor Terry Pugh decided to let his acrimonious, political, and misguided opinion of Officer Stewart influence not only the contents of the letter but the distribution of its contents to many, including various media outlets. The FOP, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. recognizes and understands the importance of the public being aware of the internal workings of its public agencies. We look forward to working with the new Mayor and her administration. We anticipate the new administration will ensure that Officer Stewart will receive a fair hearing and be cleared of the previous administration s allegations, she wrote. Stewart did not respond to requests for comment, but an FOP representative said the union would speak on his behalf. On Dec. 27, a small rally was held outside the city building that included several off duty police officers and reportedly with the support of others who were on duty. Councilman Perry Basile and Councilwoman Terra Butler spearheaded the rally in support of the police. Basile afterward said the rally was related to a disciplinary matter that he hoped would be deferred to the incoming administration. He went on to say he hoped the matter would be dismissed altogether. Thalman offered no comment about how the matter might be resolved, but she did speak about Pugh s release of the information and his description of their phone conversation. I thought it showed very poor judgment and was very indiscreet for the mayor to release what, to me, would be personnel information, especially on an investigation that was still ongoing. I thought that was not the right thing to do, Thalman said. She also took exception to Pugh describing her phone call to him as demanding. I had a witness who listened on my call, and I guarantee it was nothing but diplomatic and just that what I asked him is to make sure he s doing the best thing for the city, she said. We will move forward, we will get through this, and we look for some very exciting and wonderful things to happen to St. Clairsville. "

Clairsville,"News, Sports, Jobs - The Times Leader BELMONT One local community celebrated the changing of the guard on Saturday and marked the many accomplishments of its outgoing mayor. Belmont Village Council had passed a resolution Thursday dedicating the new Belmont Playground in honor of Stan Sobel as the torch was passed to new Mayor Ron Woods, who is seeking to complete some of the big projects begun by his predecessor. A plaque making the dedication official was presented Saturday during a large party held in Sobel s honor at the village gymnasium. During that event, Woods listed some of Sobel s many achievements while in office. In addition to spearheading the playground project, Woods said Sobel led the way for the community to obtain a new police cruiser and village truck, started the tradition of a community Christmas tree lighting, brought voting back to Belmont by helping to ensure the firehouse became handicap compliant and launched many community programs and celebrations, including a summer camp for children and a Halloween Fun Night. Most importantly, Woods said, he brought pride back to the village of Belmont. Sobel spoke only briefly to the crowd on Saturday. He said it had been his honor to serve as mayor, and he thanked council members, village employees and residents for their help during his term. The resolution was adopted Thursday as the first official legislation passed under the leadership of Woods, who was the sole candidate for mayor on the Nov. 5 ballot. Woods read the resolution, which states in part: The village of Belmont hereby dedicates the Village Playground to past Mayor Stanley A. Sobel for his dedication to the village during his time as mayor. After the unanimous vote to pass the resolution, all stood to applaud in appreciation of Sobel, who was in attendance at the meeting. I want to thank everybody for this, Sobel said Thursday. That was a big dream of mine and everybody on council at the time, and I m so happy to see it. Earlier in the meeting, after Woods and other officials were sworn in by Village Solicitor T. J. Schultz, an executive session was called for discussion of personnel, wages, the purchase of property and to fill a council seat left vacated by Lori Grobb. Grobb did not apply to be on the ballot in November due to work commitments. After the executive session, a motion was made to nominate Grobb for the empty seat as she was one of two who submitted letters of interest in the seat. Council unanimously approved the appointment of Grobb, who was sworn in before taking her seat at the table. Councilman Mike Murphy was nominated to serve as the new president of council, and other council members unanimously voted for him to serve in that capacity. Water board President Ken Davis said village wells produced 52 percent of the water used by residents in December and that the rest had been purchased from the Belmont County Water Department. Of the roughly 10 million gallons used in the village in 2019 about 6 million came from its wells, he said. Davis also expressed his condolences to the family of Tom Cook from Barnesville, who Davis said had worked as a consultant for Belmont concerning its wells and had frequently assisted when there were problems that needed addressed. Concerning the recent revelation that the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency would not allow the use of a 1,000 point asbestos assessment to help cut the cost of abatement and demolition of the old Belmont school, Davis suggested that residents contact U. S. Sen. Rob Portman, R Ohio Ohio Rep. Don Jones, R Freeport and state Sen. Frank Hoagland, R Mingo Junction to seek help. If we get enough people to shake the bush, maybe we can initiate some energy and maybe we ll still be able to do something, Davis said. Resident Don Williams noted that the litter on the hill along John Street where it enters the village is getting out of hand again and suggested that another community litter cleanup be organized. The suggestion was met with agreement, and Councilman Dan Scott suggesting that organizers wait for better weather. Woods said the village is still accepting book donations for the three library boxes that were recently donated to the village by the family of Bernice Bartles. Woods also informed council that he would be attending Mayor s Court training next week and that he and other village officials are continuing to work through the process for the 450,000 paving project that the village is seeking to fund through an Ohio Public Works Commission grant. Woods thanked everyone for their support through the transition in leadership in the village, and Sobel said he was sure the community would be happy with his leadership. Woods, who is a lifelong village resident and works as the computer services manager at St. Clairsville Public Library, later said he is looking forward to seeing the paving project as well as the demolition of the Belmont school building to completion and continue with the progress begun by Sobel. Woods previously served on Village Council and as council president, as he was one of the first to volunteer to fill council seats that were vacated when council members and the fiscal officer quit in response to Sobel s election in 2015.

Clairsville,"Boscov’s is confirmed at Eastwood NILES Cafaro Company boasts on its corporate website that the company s Ohio Valley Mall in St. Clairsville has the only Boscov s department store in Ohio. The company s going to have to get its tech people to change that it won t be accurate come the fall. October ish is when the Reading, Pa. based, family owned Boscov s is planning to open inside the massive former Sears at the Eastwood Mall, officials from Boscov s and the Cafaro Company have confirmed. The store will be Boscov s third in a Cafaro Company owned mall. The other is at Mill Creek Mall in Erie, Pa. Coincidentally, it also occupies a former Sears store. We open one store a year, so we are very selective, and this has been on the radar for many years, said Jacob Stein, senior vice president of corporate communications, real estate and maintenance for Boscov s. All of the stars kind of aligned in the last couple years that allowed this to become a real opportunity. An official announcement is planned for 11 a. m. today at the mall. It will end months of speculation surrounding just what retailer will occupy the space after Sears closed in late 2018 following bankruptcy by parent company Sears Holdings. Geography and demographics are two of the three key factors that led to Boscov s decision to open at the mall, Stein said. The other was the company s desire to partner with other family owned companies, which the Cafaro Company is, and the Cafaro Company s willingness to invest and maintain its properties in addition to its contributions to the community. You add all of those things together and that lines up to be a good opportunity for us to pursue, Stein said. We ve been looking at it for over five years. Said Joe Bell, director of corporate communications for Cafaro Company, Quite honestly, there are great parallels between his (Boscov s) and ours in terms of the way we work together, the values we hold. We have found working with Boscov s has really been a wonderful experience, not just for us, but for all of the people we serve in the various communities we serve. Boscov s, which has 49 stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, was founded in 1914 by Solomon Boscov, who settled in Reading, Pa. , from Russia and began selling household goods to farmers in the area. He opened his first retail store in 1918. The company grew through the decades and embarked on an aggressive expansion in the 2000s, but became overleveraged and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. It s former CEO, Solomon Boscov s son, Al, came out of retirement to get the company back on its feet by securing private financing and government backed loans to keep it afloat. Successfully navigating bankruptcy, Boscov s continues to expand, but at a much slower pace. This latest expansion is into a market where the company is relatively unknown, but has a core local customer base the company has found will travel to stores in St. Clairsville and in Pennsylvania. We already have a good handful of customers residing within a few miles of Niles, that Mahoning Valley market, that are shopping with us at those other stores so they are making a very long drive, which was one of the biggest points of evidence to us that this was an exciting opportunity, that this community is already making a commitment to drive very far to shop with us in our other stores, and that traditionally has been a good indicator of success, Stein said. If that community is will to drive to you, they re asking for you to come. That is their way of saying please come. Demolition work has been happening inside the former Sears to prepare the space for Boscov s. Crews have been removing the top nine inches of floor for asbestos, according to a permit granted Nov. 6 by the building department in Niles, and the site is about ready to turn over to Boscov s contractors to complete the store s build out, Bell said. The store will inhabit the 119,900 square foot space of the former Sears and more, including the 25,800 square foot Tilt Studio, which closed when its lease ended Dec. 31. In addition, several stores in that concourse will be relocated inside the mall to make way for the new retailer. They include A Nails salon, Dafffin s Candies and St. Joe s at the Mall. The Niles Boscov s will employ about 300 full and part time employees. "
Clairsville,"Macy's to close Northgate Mall location this spring Macy s Northgate Mall location will close in early spring, the company announced Monday, joining a fleet of other brick and mortar casualties in the company's battle with a rapidly changing retail industry. The decision to close a store is always a difficult one, but Macy s is proud to have served our customers in the Cincinnati community at Macy s Northgate over the past 27 years, and we look forward to continuing to do so at nearby Macy s stores, a company spokesperson wrote in a statement. The Northgate location will begin selling inventory at a discount this month and continue for up to four months before closing permanently. Some employees (the spokesperson did not specify how many) will be transferred to other Macy s stores in the Cincinnati area. The rest will receive severance packages. The company will continue to operate stores at Macy s Tri County Mall, Macy s Kenwood Towne Centre, Macy s Florence Mall and Macy s Anderson Towne Center. Macy's declined to confirm other store closures, but local media outlets in seven other cities published reports today about closures in six states. Macy's told the Cafaro Company it will close about 20 stores this year, according to spokesman Joe Bell. Cafaro's location at Ohio Valley Mall in St. Clairsville was among the closures. ""It was the only Macy's location between Columbus and Pittsburgh,"" Bell said. Macy s, which is headquartered in Cincinnati, closed its iconic Fountain Place department store in March 2018. That closure was one of 100 across the company, which CEO Jeffrey Gennette said he hoped would make the business leaner and allow reinvestment in other areas. That September, he told analysts he anticipated entering 2019 with an eye on rebuilding the business in other forms: Discount stores and pop ups, among other options, instead of traditional department stores. By late November 2019, the company was in trouble again. Macy s posted earnings of around 2 million a penny per share and cut its profit and sales expectations for the year, partially blaming weak mall traffic and website problems. We ve been investing in malls where developers are investing,"" Macy's President Hal Lawton told investors in November. ""Those stores continue to outpace the rest of our fleet. "" But Lawton also hinted that store closures might be coming in malls that haven't seen major upgrades in recent years. ""We ve been watching the trend across our malls for quite some time, specifically in the C and D malls, which are our neighborhood doors,"" he said. ""And we did see a steeper decline that we d anticipated in the quarter. """

Clairsville,"New management in St. Clairsville By ROBERT A. DEFRANK Times Leader Staff Writer ST. CLAIRSVILLE The Belmont County seat is getting a new management team of department heads and administrators along with a new mayor. On Monday evening,the city council approved a new law director and a new clerk of council, but the decision to replace long time clerk Kathy Kaluger was a divided vote. Mayor Kathryn Thalman named Elizabeth Glick as the new law director, replacing Richard Myser. Thalman said Glick comes with years of experience in law firms, as corporate counsel and the attorney for Brilliant Water and Sewer District. I (have) two days under my belt. We ve got a lot of things we ve been looking at, Thalman said. I promise to work on your behest, I look forward to working with my council. What a bunch of really wonderful people. She thanked Safety and Service Director Jim Zucal, Finance Director Cindi Henry, and Kaluger, who have agreed to stay on during the transition. I made the promise to be transparent, to advertise positions, she said, adding they were welcome to apply. Council Members Perry Basile, Terra Butler, Beth Oprisch, Mike Smith, Linda Jordan, and Frank Sabatino approved the appointment. Councilman Mark Bukmir abstained. Talk then turned to the council clerk appointment. Smith appointed Roberta Mertz, safety and service director s clerk, to the position. Jordan asked why he did not nominate Kaluger. I think it s time for a change, Smith said. That s the only reason? Jordan asked. We re not really going to open it up to anybody? Jordan asked if the matter could be discussed in executive session. Council went into executive session for about about an hour and 15 minutes to discuss personnel matters. I have not applied, Kaluger said during the wait. I have had this job for 28 years. I have not made that decision yet. When council went back into session, Smith nominated Mertz and Basile seconded. The approval passed with a vote of four to three, with Basile, Butler, Oprisch and Smith in favor and Jordan, Sabatino and Bukmir opposed. The reason for the split vote was not discussed and, when prompted, council members declined to comment. Mertz will take on the job next meeting, Jan. 21. Afterward, Kaluger said she will continue to serve as secretary at the front desk of the city building for the foreseeable future. Council also voted Beth Oprisch as president pro tempore six to one, with Bukmir opposed. Council President Jim Velas said Oprisch would take over running council meetings in the president s absence. Another position to be decided is the role of permanent police chief. The prior police chief, Jeff Henry, retired in mid December. Lt. Mike Troullos was appointed interim chief until Thalman took office. Thalman did not comment on who would be named to the chief s position or the staff. Another ongoing issue is the proposed disciplining of a police officer, T. J. Stewart, for three reported infractions in 2019. Pugh deferred the matter to Thalman s administration and released a letter to the public outlining the case. In other matters, Sabatino asked Zucal if the city had any further news from Ohio EPA about water issues. Zucal reported speaking to officials at the Southeast District of the Ohio EPA. There will be orders coming from the Ohio EPA. They re at the director s level right now to be signed. The city should see them by the end of the week. If not, the first of next week. Then we will know, in writing, all the components that we have to address, Zucal said. The future of water and wastewater service has been a major point of debate last year, with Zucal and then mayor Terry Pugh advocating for privatization of the water system on the grounds that it is aging and costly mandates from the EPA are expected. The EPA reviewed St. Clairsville s water plant after harmful algal blooms were detected this past summer. Thalman s campaign platform was to explore options including a study to determine costs and options for the city to maintain local control. "
Clairsville,"Accused bogus cop in court ST. CLAIRSVILLE The woman accused of posing as an undercover police officer in an effort to take drugs from pain clinic patients appeared in court Monday. No plea agreement was announced in the case of Marlese A. Lopez, 46, of 707 Woods Lane, Martins Ferry. She stands accused of impersonating a peace officer, a felony of the fourth degree that allegedly occurred March 20. However, Belmont County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Kevin Flanagan said the prosecution and defense were making progress. Belmont County Common Pleas Judge John Vavra set another plea agreement hearing for Jan. 13. Her trial remains set for Jan. 23. The charges stem from two incidents in the St. Clairsville area. According to law enforcement, Lopez followed individuals from the pain clinic to their homes, claimed to be an undercover officer investigating the clinic, and questioned them about their medication, asking to inspect the medication and if they had any OxyContin. The patients reportedly did not have any medication with them at the time. According to the sheriff s office, while deputies and local police departments do utilize plain clothes officers, these officers always carry proper identification. Anyone approached by someone claiming to be a plain clothes officer should not hesitate to ask for identification, authorities said. In other matters, James Christopher Spears, 43, of 34 Owl Court, Wheeling was sentenced on two counts of trafficking in drugs on June 5, 2012. Vavra imposed one year of community controls. Spears will serve one year in jail with credit for 186 days served. He will serve until July 3. It s a six year old case, and you ve done absolutely nothing to help yourself, Vavra said, adding that Spears was being sentenced after failing to complete the drug court program. Vavra said Spears prior record has demonstrated a pattern of substance abuse, although he has no prior felony offenses. You did not make a good faith effort (in drug court). You abused drugs throughout that program until the present. Belmont County Public Defender Frank Pierce asked Vavra to consider Spears efforts to reform. I was a different person back then, Spears said, adding he is now employed. I m not the same person I was even three years ago. Vavra imposed community controls in accordance with state guidelines. Were it up to me, you d go to the penitentiary, Vavra said. It s ridiculous that we re still having to deal with this after this period of time. Also, William James Hutchison, 40, of 111 Mackey Drive, Barnesville pleaded guilty to theft of drugs on July 12. His sentencing was set for Jan. 13. A pre sentence investigation, victim impact statement and Eastern Ohio Correction Center evaluation were ordered. The charges stem from allegations that Hutchison entered a friend s home in Barnesville and stole prescription pills. "
Clairsville,"Ex-con who claimed to be missing boy to plead guilty in Ohio: documents (Reuters) A former convict who drew national attention last year when he claimed to be an Illinois teen who went missing in 2011 after his mother killed herself has agreed to plead guilty, court papers showed. FILE PHOTO: Brian Rini, 23, is seen in this prison photo from Belmont Correctional Institution in Clairsville, Ohio, U. S. , obtained on April 4, 2019. Courtesy Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation Correction/Handout via REUTERS Brian Rini, 24, of Medina, Ohio, was charged in federal court in Cincinnati in April with lying to federal agents after he told authorities in Newport, Kentucky, that he was missing teen Timmothy Pitzen and that he had escaped from an eight year ordeal at the hands of sex traffickers. Pitzen was last seen in May 2011 when he was 6 years old. Details of the plea agreement were sealed when it was entered into the court on Monday, according to online case records. Rini faces up to eight years in prison if found guilty. U. S. prosecutor Kyle Healey who is trying the case and Rini s attorney Richard Monahan, a public defender, were unavailable for comment. A status conference in the case was scheduled for Wednesday. Rini s claim that he was Pitzen was debunked after DNA test results conducted at the Cincinnati Children s Hospital confirmed he was not the long lost boy from Aurora, Illinois. After confessing that he was not Pitzen, Rini told federal agents he had heard about the missing boy s case on the ABC television program 20/20 and wanted to get away from his own family, according to court documents. Rini had twice before claimed to be a child sex trafficking victim, federal prosecutors said. He was released from Ohio s Belmont Correctional Institution on March 7 where he had been serving 14 months for burglary and vandalism, according to public records. Pitzen s case has stumped authorities since he disappeared in May 2011. The boy was last seen with his mother, who pulled him out of school in Aurora, a far west suburb of Chicago, took him on a trip to a zoo and a water park, and then took her own life in a motel room, leaving behind a cryptic note on her son s whereabouts.

Update (Jan. 9, 2020) Macy s has confirmed another set of more than a dozen closures, bringing the total number of shutterings to roughly 30 stores. Over the next couple of months, the retailer expects to hold liquidation sales as it downsizes its fleet of brick and mortar outposts. One Bloomingdale s location is also scheduled to shut down. FN has provided a list of the closures below. What We Reported (Jan. 7, 2020): Macy s Is Closing More Than a Dozen Stores in Early 2020 Macy s is set to close more than a dozen stores early this year. The department store chain has confirmed the closures of 15 outposts across the country, including locations in shopping centers as well as free standing locations.

In a statement to FN, a spokesperson said that Macy s regularly review s our store portfolio and will provide an update on the store closures at its investor day on Feb. 5. The announcement comes less than two months after the company posted its third quarter earnings report ended Nov. 2, logging its first same store sales decline in two years and slashing its guidance for the full year. The Cincinnati based firm blamed the disappointing results on the warmer fall season, coupled with slowing foot traffic, amid a broader shift from brick and mortar to online retail. After seven consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth, we experienced a deceleration in our third quarter sales, Chairman and CEO Jeff Gennette acknowledged in a statement. While we anticipated a negative comp because we were lapping a very strong third quarter last year, the sales deceleration was steeper than we expected. In the past few months, Macy s has been investing more resources in its e commerce mobile app, which it said is on track to exceed the goal of 1.5 billion in sales, as well as enhancing its website to promote online sales and drive in store visits. Although Gennette said on Nov. 21 that the retailer has confidence in our holiday strategies, Macy s has lowered its outlook, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of 2.57 to 2.77, below the previous guidance of 2.85 to 3.05. It also expects sales to be down 2.5% to 2.0%, versus the previous reading of approximately flat sales.

Clairsville,"Macy's Shutting Down 15 Stores: Which Ones, Why, Everthing to Know! At the star of 2020, Macy's announced that they will be closing down 15 of their stores. This is not the first time that Macy's made such decision. Back in 2016, the luxury department store announced that their constant decline in sales pushed them to close 100 of their stores. Since then, they have been shuting down stores one after another as their leases expire. A spokesperson from Macy's could not confirm if these recent store closures are still part of the announcement they made in 2016. However, the spokesperson said that the stores undergo ""regular reviews. "" Moreover, they promise to give their investors an update during their meeting set on Feb. 5 of this year. The spokesperson also told Business Insider that all their regular, non seasonal employees, who have been laid off and could not find a job at nearby Macy's stores would be given severance pay. Tight Competition? Macy's is not the first retail store to speak openly about how tight competition is greatly affecting the sales in their physical stores. Online shopping has provided people with more options for shopping. And while others prefer to see the item first before they make a purchase, the idea of shopping from the comforts of one's home is amazingly tempting. While Macy's continue to do its best to work on a turnaround and make their retail store appealing to consumers, the company could not help but close a few more early this year. As the lease of these stores comes to its end, the management has decided to close 15 Macy's outlets to pave way for more constructive, financially earning investments. The decline in sales may continue as well, with local reports saying that there are more than 15 stores that will be closed even before the second quarter of this year opens. Did the tight competition among retail stores, including online shopping, caused this? There is no actual evidence or study showing it, but the strong association in the decline of sales in Macy's (and other retail stores) and the increasing sales of online shopping clearly shows what the consumers prefer. Which Stores Will Close? The stores of Macy's that are expected to close this year includes the following: Macon Mall, Macon, GA The Centre at Salisbury, Salisbury, MD Nittany Mall, State College, PA Harrisburg Mall, Harrisburg, PA Rivergate Mall, Goodlettsville, TN Westfield Meriden, Meriden, CT University Mall, Carbondale, IL Towne Square Mall, Owensboro, KY Northgate Mall, Cincinnati, OH Stow Kent Plaza, Stow, OH 54 East Main Street, Walla Walla, WA Ohio Valley Mall, St Clairsville, OH 300 Pine Street, Seattle, WA Lewiston Center Mall, Lewiston, ID Burlington Mall, Burlington, WA. All these 15 stores will have their lease contract come to an end. The management has decided not to renew as these stores do not generate enough sales to suffice. However, in more recent news, the shares of stocks of Macy's were up by 2.72 percent on Tuesday. The investors remain hopeful that there would be no more stores that need to be closed. Macy's is one of those retail stores that have become a household name. The closing of the 15 stores may be seen as a good business move, but it does affect thousands of people who are set to lose their jobs. The families that depend on their income from Macy's will indeed have a tighter start this 2020. "
Clairsville,"Two Begin Serving Sentences for Vehicular Homicides ST. CLAIRSVILLE Two people have begun serving jail sentences for two unrelated fatal crashes in Belmont County. Cortney Otto, 22, of Bethesda was sentenced to 30 days in jail in Belmont County Western Division Court for vehicular homicide, a misdemeanor of the first degree. According to court records, she will complete her sentence in 10 installments served on weekends, beginning this past Friday and ending March 2. She had been charged in the crash that killed Betsy Dodd, 80, of Barnesville on Ohio 147 near milepost 11 in Goshen Township, just outside of Bethesda. The incident occurred on May 5 of 2019, said Belmont County Assistant Prosecutor Joseph Vavra, who prosecuted the case in Western Division Court before Judge Eric Costine. (She) was sentenced Oct. 15. Otto s situation was pretty unfortunate for everybody involved. She was a younger individual coming home from work and fell asleep at the wheel almost at her house. Crossed over and struck another vehicle where an elderly passenger passed away, he said. It was definitely an accident no impairments. Meanwhile, Andrew Miller, 36, of 1231 W. 35th St. North, Wichita, Kansas, is serving a 45 day sentence for vehicular homicide, a misdemeanor of the second degree, and will be released Feb. 14. The incident occurred in June 2018. Vavra said Miller also crossed the center line on I 70 west of St. Clairsville. He pleaded no contest in October. He began serving his sentence Monday. He was hauling a boat, and a vehicle in another lane left the roadway into the grass median and the passenger in that vehicle passed away, Vavra said. There was no impairment or wrongdoing. It was an accident and, unfortunately, caused the death of another individual. Jeffrey McClurg, 51, of Worthington, Ohio, was ejected and killed in that accident. "
Clairsville,"Macy's to Close 29 Stores as CEO Offers Reassurance Macy s Inc. , under scrutiny as department stores struggle to adapt to changes in the way consumers shop, rose in early trading after Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said the retailer s performance is improving. Macy s also said it will close 28 namesake stores and one Bloomingdale s in the coming weeks, while reducing some headcount at Bloomingdale s. Same store sales, a key metric of retailers success, fell 0.6% in November and December at company owned and licensed stores from a year earlier. Gennette said the holiday sales reflected a strong trend improvement from the third quarter. Macy s stock (M) was higher in early trading. The shares fell 43% last year. The rise suggests investors were already expecting lower comparable sales and were reassured by Gennette s comments. The decline in sales is nowhere near as bad as it could have been and represents a marked improvement from the dismal third quarter when comparable sales declined by 3.9%, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in emailed comments. The company said it will hold a meeting with investors on Feb. 5 in New York, where it will release a three year strategy. Macy s, which had the second worst performing stock in the S P 500 last year, has been closing underperforming stores amid working to reduce superfluous inventory for several years. The earnings news calmed fears of a more dramatic fall in the department store operator's numbers for the crucial annual shopping season after an earlier profit warning, Reuters explained. Macy's, which cut its annual profit forecast in November blaming weak international tourism and sluggish mall traffic, is among the first major corporate names to report sales for the holiday season seen as a barometer for the health of U. S. consumer spending. The company's holiday sales benefited from strong online sales and demand for gift products, Gennette said. U. S. consumers are increasingly spending more money online rather than traveling to physical stores during the holiday season, forcing traditional brick and mortar retailers to build their apps with more shopping and delivery options. U. S. e commerce sales in the period from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 18.8%, according to a Dec. 25 report by Mastercard Inc. , while overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose just 3.4%. The 0.6% reported drop at Macy's owned and licensed stores was for the months of November and December. The months make up the vast majority of fourth quarter comparable sales, which analysts had estimated to fall 1.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Meanwhile, compiled from various media reports, a list of some of Macy's stores closing in 2020: Connecticut Westfield Meriden Mall, Meriden Florida Pompano Citi Centre, Pompano Beach Seminole Towne Center, Sanford Indian River Mall, Vero Beach The Falls, Miami Bloomingdales Georgia The Gallery at South DeKalb, Decatur Macon Mall, Macon Idaho Lewiston Center Mall, Lewiston Illinois University Mall, Carbondale Spring Hill Mall, West Dundee Indiana Muncie Mall, Muncie Kansas Prairie Village Shopping Center, Prairie Village Kentucky Towne Square Mall, Owensboro Maryland The Centre at Salisbury, Salisbury Massachusetts The Mall at Whitney Field, Leominster Montana Northside Center, Helena North Carolina Hanes Mall, Winston Salem Ohio Northgate Mall, Greater Cincinnati Ohio Valley Mall, St. Clairsville Stow Kent Plaza, Stow Pennsylvania Harrisburg Mall, Harrisburg Nittany Mall, State College Tennessee Rivergate Mall, Goodlettsville Washington Cascade Mall, Burlington Downtown Seattle, Seattle Downtown Walla Walla, Walla Walla Material from Reuters and Bloomberg has been used in this report.

S. prosecutor said. Brian Rini, 24, of Medina, Ohio, faces up to two years in prison. He was charged in federal court in Cincinnati in April with lying to federal agents after he told authorities in Newport, Kentucky, that he was Timmothy Pitzen, last seen in May 2011 when he was six years old.

Clairsville,"Loan renewed for Belmont slip repairs ST. CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County s board of commissioners heard an update on road slip repair Wednesday. Commissioners Josh Meyer, J. P. Dutton and Jerry Echemann renewed a 4 million loan to pay part of the cost of repairing, constructing and reconstructing roads in the county. The commissioners also approved Dinsmore Shohl LLP to act as bond counsel. A federal disaster was declared for the local area last February. According to the county engineer s office, Belmont County sustained close to 12 million worth of road damage. Engineer Terry Lively explained that the county must complete the work before being reimbursed with federal funds through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We borrowed that (money) to give us a head start on the slip repairs. The way the FEMA money works, once it finally gets authorized, we have to go out and make the repair, and they reimburse us for that. We weren t sure of the pace in which those projects would get approved. My concern was we were going to have a bunch of projects sitting here, ready to go, and not have the money to do the work up front. So I asked the commissioners to get a loan, using license plate fees as the payment, so we could get those projects rolling as quickly as possible, as soon as they get through the process and get approved by FEMA or Federal Highways. Lively said the money was borrowed for a period of one year and the loan had to be renewed. They pay back the whole 4 million, and then re borrow it, he said. There s interest to pay on that, but in my opinion it s well worth it to pay that interest, so that we have the flexibility to get on these slips as quickly as possible and get them repaired, he said. Lively said additional license plate fees approved by the commissioners several years ago generate about 800,000 annually. Using that money to pay the interest, pay the loan off, he said, adding the license plate funds will be used for street paving and guardrail repairs after the emergency damage is repaired. Once we get the slips done. He said the interest was about three percent. The annual interest payment is almost 120,000. In answer to the commissioners questions, Lively said the process remains a slow one. We re not getting things approved as quickly as we had hoped. We are getting things done, little by little, he said. He said four FEMA projects have been completed and two more have been approved, and one completed for Federal Highways. Lively said he hopes multiple Federal Highways projects will be approved at once. I think this is going to be a busy year as far as construction. We ll see a lot of things happening, at least on the Federal Highways side. On the FEMA side, we re still working our way through that red tape, he said. He said slips have been repaired on Belmont County Road 5, or Ramsey Ridge Road, near Alledonia Pleasant Ridge, south of Belmont and two on Fulton Hill in Pultney Township. We still have Road Closed signs up, because we have three other slips on Fulton Road. We re allowing local traffic through it, but we don t want big vehicles going through there, he said. He said slip repair for Blaine Chermont Road in Bridgeport has been bid out and utilities were were being relocated. Lively hopes the project will be done soon. It s completely out of our hands. We have to wait on the utility companies to move, he said. Mount Olivett Road in Barnesville is also close to approval. He said a slip on Crabapple Road in the St. Clairsville area has also been repaired. He said the projects that have been repairs are so far all from the 2018 disaster. The 2019 stuff is not even close to being ready yet, he said. Out of the 2018 disaster, we probably have 45 slips. Out of the 2019, we probably added another 20 to 25. Some of them have been rejected by FEMA so we re going to have to fix them as best we can. Lively said in a normal year, his office would deal with as many as five slips. We re used to that, but when we get hit with 40 to 50 of them in a year, it s overwhelming, he said. Afterward, he said he also applied for a grant through the new Oil and Shale Program through the Ohio Department of Transportation. It s designed to help the counties in this part of the state that are impacted by oil and gas activity. Most of those roads are covered by (road use maintenance) agreements, and this is specifically designed to help out roads that don t have a RUMA agreement on it, even though they re getting traffic, and they re getting damage, Lively said. I submitted an application back in October, we got a project approved down on Blaine Barton Road. It s a slip down there, and we got about 145,000 to repair that slip. He said the slip dates from prior to 2018 and was exacerbated by more recent wet weather. Work should begin 2021. Afterward, John Drewett of Lashley Hill Road, Shadyside, said his road continues to be closed due to two year old slips. In 2018, there was supposed to be money allotted for slips then, and we re behind. It s 2020 now, he said. Where (are we) on the list? There s no light at the end of the tunnel. I don t even see a tunnel. They re not catching up to 2018, how are we going to get things taken care of? This process has drug on, Dutton said. The incident in 2018 was very significant, followed by an incident in 2019, which affected these sites from 2018, which grew in scope and had to be re evaluated. We re as frustrated as everyone else. The engineer just can t go out and start doing these projects. He ll be bankrupt by the end of the week, Meyer said. "
Clairsville,"Martins Ferry couple still missing after 18 months MARTINS FERRY Local law enforcement officers still are looking for a Martins Ferry couple who went missing more than a year ago. Brian Goff, 64, and Joni Davis, 55, of Martins Ferry were last seen on June 10, 2018, leaving Pizza Hut at the Wetzel Springs Plaza on National Road, St. Clairsville. They were driving Goff s light blue 1990 Oldsmobile Delta 88. The four door vehicle has an Ohio license plate number of EYA 7482. Goff is Davis caregiver. Davis previously suffered a traumatic brain injury. Belmont County Sheriff s Department Chief Deputy James Zusack said the sheriff s department still is working the case along with the Jefferson County Sheriff s Department. Our detective (Randy Stewart) is working the case, and other agencies are working with us. Nothing has changed with that, Zusack said. Last June, family members of the missing pair decided to offer a reward for information leading to finding them. Stewart noted previously that the FBI had been working the case. Now, however,the FBI is just in contact with local officials about it. The FBI typically becomes involved in missing person cases 90 days after a person is declared missing. Since the couple s disappearance, planes have flown over miles of Belmont and Jefferson counties and police have conducted dozens of interviews. Cadaver dogs have been employed, and divers have searched bodies of water for human remains. Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abadalla previously said that foul play is suspected. He did not respond to requests for comment for this report. Those who may have information regarding the couple s whereabouts can call the Belmont County Sheriff s Department at 740 695 7933 or the Jefferson County Sheriff s Department at 740 283 8600. "

Last year, the health department spent 197,000 of a 200,000 grant for septic remediation, said Robert Sproul, deputy health commissioner. The remaining 3,000 from that grant is being carried over for the 2020 program, he added. Using the grant funds, the health department awarded contracts to replace 15 sewage treatment systems for qualifying county homeowners in 2019, Sproul said. The average cost of each replacement system was 13,197. The grants are awarded through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency s water pollution control loan fund. A homeowner s income eligibility for participation in the septic remediation program is based on U. S. poverty guidelines. In other action taken at Monday s meeting, the board voted to accept a recommendation by Linda Mehl, director of nursing, to hire a medical billing clerk. Meanwhile, Mehl said a decision hasn t been made on a contract proposal submitted to Nationwide Children s Hospital in Columbus for conducting the Personal Responsibility Education Program in five counties. If approved, the health department would serve as a subcontractor. Last month, she said the health department didn t receive a PREP grant for 2020 21, resulting in a loss of 80,000 in funding annually. Instead, the Ohio Department of Youth Services awarded a two year contract to Nationwide Children s Hospital. PREP funds are used to provide preventive education for youth in foster care and the juvenile justice system, she said. The program seeks to reduce the rate of teen pregnancy and to prevent incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. Mehl said a new program to provide car seats to area families will begin after a supply of the devices arrives. She hopes that car seats will be delivered in February. An employee of the health department is undergoing training for the car seat program this week, Mehl said. The health department was asked to take over the local project after East Ohio Regional Hospital and Ohio Valley Medical Center closed. The two hospitals had managed the program since 2012.

Clairsville,"New Bellaire eatery celebrates grand opening BELLAIRE Sakura Family Restaurant celebrated its grand opening Wednesday, ready to bring Asian and American style cuisine to Bellaire. The restaurant opened recently in the former Rigas restaurant building at 3290 Belmont St. , Bellaire. It is owned and operated by Powhatan Point residents Ling Curtis and her sister May Jiang. Curtis and Jiang celebrated the grand opening with a ribbon cutting ceremony hosted by the St. Clairsville Area Chamber of Commerce. The Rigas restaurant closed in 2017 after 54 years in business. The property was on the market for about two years before Curtis and Jiang purchased it last year. Curtis said business has been good at the location, and her customers have given Sakura a 4.9 out of a 5 star rating online. We re trying to make it to 5, she said following the ribbon cutting ceremony. A lot of people come (to Bellaire) just for our food. She said in addition to Bellaire residents, people from other surrounding communities come to Sakura as well. Curtis said she hopes the village s population increases in the future, which would help support the eatery. Wendy Anderson, St. Clairsville Area Chamber of Commerce director, said Bellaire has a lot to offer and new businesses continue to open there. Anderson said the chamber wants to see more small businesses open there, and she wants to promote those already there. She is encouraging existing village businesses to consider joining the chamber, since the Bellaire chamber is no longer in operation. She said small businesses are necessary to support the local economy. And if a possible ethane cracker plant is built at Dilles Bottom, Bellaire, like many other communities, will need to be ready. Bellaire Councilman Gay Lucci said he has eaten at the restaurant several times and is impressed with the quality of the food. I love it. I m glad they re here and grateful they re here, Lucci said. We needed it and I m sure people appreciate it. The Sakura menu includes Asian dishes such as Hibachi style dinners and American style food such as burgers, fries and milkshakes. Asian style dishes include spicy pork, General Tso s chicken, and more, as well as a special dish bulgogi, which consists of thin slices of beef flavored in a sweet Korean style barbecue, as well as both Asian and American style appetizers and salad options. Sakura is open 7 a. m. to 8 p. m. Monday Thursday 7 a. m. to 9 p. m. Friday Saturday and 7 a. m. to 3 p. m. Sundays. "
Clairsville,"News, Sports, Jobs - The Times Leader BARNESVILLE A local farmer recently donated more than 300 pounds of ground beef for distribution to five local food banks. The Belmont County Farm Bureau accepted the donation on behalf of the food banks. Jerry Ebbert, president of Belmont County Farm Bureau, said the anonymous donor raises his own beef cattle in the Belmont County. He s been quite supportive of the farm bureau for a number of years, Ebbert said. Ebbert noted that after the Christmas season, many food pantries see a decline in donations from the public, making the beef donation timely. It was born in the county, raised in the county and fed in the county, Ebbert said of the animal, noting it also was processed in Belmont County. They re using it now. A lot of pantries are forgotten about when the calendar changes. Pantries that received the meat included the Belmont County Salvation Army, Bridgeport Food Pantry, Five Loaves Food Ministry, Project Manna and St. Clairsville Food Pantry. The fellow who donated it did it out of the goodness of his heart, Ebbert said. Ebbert said the farm bureau s annual membership drive also is underway. He said the group, which is a nonprofit organization that advocates for farmers and landowners rights and related state and federal legislation, has 925 members. It s a grassroots organization. We re part of the Ohio Farm Bureau, which was instrumental in the current agriculture use value (law). It adjusts the (real estate tax value) for what a land s production capabilities are, he said. For example, farm land that is used for growing crops is typically valued more than land used for grazing. It saves us as much as 4,000 a year. It evens the playing field, he said. The farm bureau also serves as a watch dog when it comes to legislation, such as those bills related to the environment and water quality. Last year, the farm bureau donated meat to the food pantries from two hogs it jointly purchased at the Belmont County Fair. Last summer it raised more than 40,000 to purchase food in bulk for a backpack program for a few different school districts. The food will last two years. "
Clairsville,"Feast of Epiphany commemorates baptism of Christ By KIMBERLY HURLEY Special to The Times Leader Christ is Baptized! In the Jordan! Today we greet one another with this holy declaration, because it is the Feast of Theophany (Epiphany), the commemoration of the baptism of Christ in the Jordan River. The word, Theophany means the showing forth, the manifestation, of God. This feast has been annually commemorated since the very early days of Christianity, because it confirms the foundational Christian doctrine of God as trinity. In Matthew, Chapter 3, we see Jesus Christ come to be baptized. and when He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting upon Him. And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased. ' (verses 16 17, New King James Version) Notice that all three Persons of the Blessed Trinity appear in this passage. Some modern thinkers will point out that the Latin derived word, Trinity, which has been used to describe the Three Persons of the Godhead, does not appear in the Bible. This is true, but the early Church Fathers made sure that this Feast Day, and its accompanying hymnography (where much of the Church teaching resides), was given a prominent position in the Church calendar, because of the foundational truths it conveys. It is literally the first Major Feast of the New Year. The ancient hymn of the Feast clearly delineates this foundational Christian Truth: At Your baptism in the Jordan, O Lord, worship of the Trinity was revealed. For the Father s voice bore witness to You, calling You His beloved Son and the Spirit in the form of a dove confirmed the truth of these words. O Christ God, Who appeared and enlightened the world, Glory to You! This year, Lord willing, I hope to bring you a series of articles on the major Sacraments of the Church, and demonstrate how participation in these Sacraments brings us into the Kingdom of God. Since today marks the Baptism of Christ, and since it is now a New Year, this is a good time to examine the first Sacrament of Holy Baptism. Whether a person is baptized as a baby, at the request of parents or at a later date, when he or she has come to the knowledge of his or her need of salvation, baptism literally marks the beginning of a new life in Christ. It is literally our first imitation of Christ s earthly life. We follow Him into the water, and symbolically experience the death of the old man, and rebirth into the new life of salvation. This sacrament is not optional. The Lord said, He who believes and is baptized will be saved. (Mark 16:16 RSV). I once knew a man who went to church regularly from childhood, but refused Baptism for many years. I do not know all of his reasons, but he said that he didn t need Baptism to be a Christian. In this modern day and age, many people decide they don t need to do this or that to be a Christian. Jesus said in John 3:5, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water, and of the Spirit, he can not enter into the Kingdom of God. You might hear some people try to say, Well, Jesus does not mention the word Baptism here. But the Apostle Peter makes no bones about the necessity of this Sacrament for salvation. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. ' (Acts 2:38, KJV) If a person never knew the Lord in life, and then calls upon Him on his deathbed, will he be saved, even though he was not baptized? Well, the Bible does say that if a man calls upon the name of the Lord, he will be saved. But if I am using that scripture as an excuse to refuse this first sacramental encounter with God, if I spend my life refusing to imitate Christ in baptism, if I intentionally cherry pick scriptures that support my rejection of clear biblical instruction, will my late deathbed call assure my place in Heaven? Maybe. Only God can judge. But I am not inclined to take that chance with my eternal salvation. Reflecting back on recent holiday gatherings, our families lovingly prepared a feast with every intention that all comers might partake. God has prepared the Sacraments so that we might partake, so that we might physically meet and experience His spiritual bounty. In Galatians 3:27, the Apostle Paul writes, For as many of you who were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. If you have never put on Christ in Holy Baptism, may this be the year that you do. As always, all are welcome at the Divine Services at Saint Nicholas Orthodox Church, in Barton, Ohio. If you are reading this early on Sunday morning, and want to drop in, services begin at 10 a. m. Bring a jar and take some newly blessed Holy Water home with you! Hurley is a member of the Saint Nicholas Church in Barton and lives in St. Clairsville. "

Clairsville,"News, Sports, Jobs - The Times Leader ST. CLAIRSVILLE City Council is divided on creating a new director of development position with members at odds over the new mayor s administration. Council went into executive session for about a half hour Tuesday to discuss matters of personnel, with Councilman Frank Sabatino voting against an executive session and the other council members in favor. Councilman Mark Bukmir was absent. Afterward, council voted on whether to dispense with three readings and pass a resolution creating the position of chief of staff/director of development for the city. According to the ordinance, Mayor Kathryn Thalman has recommended this and the position would have a salary of 48,500 per year during a six month instructional period, and afterward increased to 53,500 per year. After the executive session, Sabatino and Councilwoman Linda Jordan voted against dispensing with three readings while Council Members Perry Basile, Beth Oprisch, Mike Smith and Terra Butler voted in favor. Because there was an insufficient majority, council held the first reading. A vote will not take place until the third reading. After three weeks, I am very disappointed in the mayor for creating and not advertising, Sabatino said. She promised when she ran to cut taxes, and here we are creating a new position which will cost the taxpayers anywhere from 48,500 to 53,500 a year, plus benefits. The person she has in mind, I question her qualifications and it would happen to be Ms. Thalman s best friend, and this person is not a city resident. Basile disagreed. I ve been here for two years. We ve had nothing but dissension in the city. It s been a nightmare. We ve been fighting back and forth. We ve got nothing done, he said, adding the environment has not been conducive to business and development. I ve watched angry business owners on Main Street with nothing good to say. We need a new face on this city. We need to put someone in that position who s going to go out and bring businesses into this city. We don t need a bureaucrat. We need someone (with a business background) who knows how to get stuff done. Questioning the qualifications of a person does not set well with me, Oprisch said. Wanting to be a good steward of the taxpayers money is absolutely our job. We should question and we should express our opinions, but we also shouldn t disagree just to disagree. Afterward, Thalman said the position was necessary to make St. Clairsville business friendly. She pointed out new developments in the county, such as the proposed PTT Global Chemical America ethane cracker plant eyed for the Dilles Bottom area. They would be a liaison to business helping me with internal development. Things that need changed in the absolute internal structure of the business plan of our city. There are things that are antiquated, archaic and need fixed, she said. As well as outside development. Complimentary businesses that might come with the PTT cracker plant. Businesses coming to the (St. Clair) commons. Meeting with developers. Meeting with landowners. Thalman also commented on the matter of the proposed disciplining of a police officer, T. J. Stewart, for three reported infractions in 2019. Outgoing mayor Terry Pugh deferred the matter to Thalman s administration and released a letter to the public outlining the case. The police matter has been resolved. I followed the recommendations of the two law firms who reviewed the information. The appropriate recommended measures were put in place. We took the recommended action. It is now behind us. We will move forward, Thalman said. Afterward, Thalman said Stewart remains on the police force, but did not comment on any change on his status or the nature of any discipline. She criticized Pugh s decision to make the matter public. Sabatino asked if a report would be made available to council. Thalman said it would, but the matter will not be made public. During the meeting, Thalman reported on other economic matters. She has met with Belmont County commissioners to discuss development. We re looking at how we can all work together to get the (St. Clair) Commons moving. We don t want to see that sit, she said. There s a lot of things coming to the valley. We want to be a part of it. She said the city continued to advise for the position of safety and service director and finance director, with resumes accepted until Jan. 27. She said she also hopes to have a permanent chief of police in place by the next council meeting. Thalman has also met with representatives from Aqua Ohio, the private entity that has negotiated with the prior administration to purchase the water and wastewater service. Thalman is asking the company to change its April deadline for the city to decide on a sale so that she can look into a study of the costs of meeting Ohio Environmental Protection Agency regulations and maintaining local control. Answering a question from Jordan, Thalman said she would be meeting with the EPA soon. "
Clairsville,"Our People: Judith Jeffries Upon retiring from her 20 year career from Carolinas HealthCare System, Judith A Jeffries began devoting much of her time to volunteering in the LGBTQ community. Jeffries began her volunteer work by advocating for families who were seeking information on the needs of transgender patients. She fought for these families to have educational literature provided and was successful in doing so. Jeffries continued her work and began volunteering for RAIN, where she is now board chair. She is a member of the Charlotte LGBTQ Elders group and also serves on the board for the Center for Prevention Services. As a more seasoned member of the LGBTQ community, you ve had the opportunity to see our community grow and evolve. What comes to mind when you think of significant milestones as well as setbacks in the LGBTQ community? I remember being young and appreciating what my elder LGBTQ mentors went through. I lived and thrived on their shoulders. I remember going to gay bars and switching partners when the blue light came on because the police were coming. I remember going out to the parking lot and finding all our windshields smashed. Mostly, I remember how much we loved and adored each other. Milestones: I remember when Angels in America was presented and celebrated in Charlotte even though there were obnoxious protests. Rough times. There was no agency to protect us. We just kept living and loving. Marriage equality! Woo Hoo! Brenda and I got married on May 23, 2015, and have been together for 30 years. Becoming a founder of the Carolinas HealthCare System s first LGBTQ System Resource Group, EQualityOne. We garnered super support. Our executive sponsors were the cream of the crop, Derek Raghavan, M. D. , and Craig Richardville. Of course, coming out at work was a big ole milestone. Scary but big! Setbacks: Bill James, county commissioner. Now there s a guy who can t let go of fairy tales. Terrified of being outed at CHS. Knowing full well I could be fired for being suspected as a gay person. I consider super conservative, evangelical Christians as setbacks because they have difficulty listening to their hearts and absolutely no difficulty listening to their spewing preachers. I only wish I could understand better and help them feel safe. How have these milestones and/or setbacks affected you personally? Staying in the closet for so long made me physically ill because I could not bring my whole self to work. By nature I am gregarious, and I want to help make situations better. I want to bring dignity and humanity to the forefront. What was your experience like as an openly lesbian professional during your time at Carolinas HealthCare System? Once I came out (I felt safe enough to do so), I felt like I could do anything! Acceptance was gleeful. The Diversity Department at CHS was superior. However, I understand that if I had come out years before, I would most likely have lost my job. What does your position as chair of RAIN entail? I serve as an ambassador for the organization, telling RAIN s beautiful story and representing RAIN at events and elsewhere in the community. I partner with our CEO, Debbie Warren, to plan our board meetings and involve all members in various aspects of leadership. We as a board ensure that we have a solid strategic plan and a sustainable business model. We deliver on our mission year after year and so it is a joy for me to serve an organization so beloved and so vital to our community. What type of contributions do you provide to the community as a board member of the Charlotte LGBTQ Elders group? Well, I am an LGBTQ Elder. I hope to help with the transition experience of our LGBTQ Elders when they may face losing some of their independence and dignity. Hopefully, housing, homelessness and family support are not part of the equation. How has your volunteer work in the LGBTQ community impacted your life? My life is full and beautiful now. I have always been a happy person, but now I believe there is a large dose of joy factored in. What has been your biggest motivation to continue your volunteer work? Oh, I am selfish. I get so much from volunteering, connecting and encouraging people. RAIN, LGBTQ Elders and Innovate Charlotte are all near and dear to me. Another volunteer passion I have is with the substance dependent and recovering community. The Center for Prevention Services is a strong non profit that addresses the opioid crisis by building support systems for people who use drugs, syringe access program Youth Drug Survey with Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools, peer support, etc. Being able to connect people with people, resources, and agencies is great and fulfilling. What is your strategy when encountering individuals who may object to your being openly lesbian? Perhaps the initial reaction is to lash out, but that is just being defensive and not helpful. I truly do want to know why. As I said before, I would like to gently get to the root of the objection or the discomfort. Perhaps turn the objection around and understand by using four to five why questions. That is if the individual can connect with me for a little bit and me to him/her. Hopefully, we can get to a safe place in our conversation. Outside of your volunteer work, how do you contribute to making the world a better place for the LGBTQ community? Staying involved. I hope I understand sustainability better than I used to. We could all use a little more of that. We humans just have such trouble giving back to Mother Earth. What advice can you offer the younger LGBTQ generation? Keep being your authentic self and changing minds for the better. You are the future. Reach out to us if you get stuck. Don t forget: Time Out Youth is there to help. We are not OK Boomers all the time. What sort of challenges or obstacles have you and Brenda faced as an interracial couple in the South? It s tough to distinguish if the setbacks and disrespect came from being an interracial couple or homophobia. We still have trouble getting seated and served in restaurants in the order in which we arrived. Brenda doesn t put up with it. The wait staff often look to me first for my order, and I always redirect them to Brenda. At retails, Brenda often has to deal with the salespeople following her around the store. I am usually oblivious because I am looking for something. Brenda grew up in inner city Louisville, and she is wary. I am doing better about paying attention and being an upstander. I speak up more. What knowledge or insights have you gained from Brenda in relation to her being a woman of color? She has taught me to pay attention when people get too close to our personal space. Always be aware of your surroundings. Know where the exit is, keep your back to the wall and your front to the door and never, ever look at the person in the car in the lane beside you. Don t go Uptown during the Republican convention. She insists this will help keep us alive. She is probably correct. I hate it, but she is probably correct. I also am examining my unconscious bias with regard to race and different origins. I want to understand and embrace it. Being a privileged white person is not something that brings me happiness. Where did you grow up? Saint Clairsville, Ohio. It s between Columbus and Pittsburgh, Pa. What s your favorite color? Red. Absolutely. Real red not orange red. What are some of your and Brenda s favorite hobbies or pastimes? We love to garden. We also like to rescue animals we have five dogs and four cats. Luckily we have one and a half acres the animals have access to play on. We also like to spend time in the mountains and at the beach. We enjoy spending time with our friends and families. "
Clairsville,"Be Local By Experiencing Convenience and Friendly Service at Porterfield’s Drive-Thru Porterfield s Drive Thru Farm Garden on Rehm Road off U. S. 40 just east of St. Clairsville has earned recognition and loyal customers from near and far since owner Kirke Porterfield started the business in 1991. Porterfield said he draws on deep roots and a farming tradition in serving the area s agricultural needs. We ve farmed forever. My family started farming in Belmont County in 1809, so I continued. Then we started selling fertilizer, seed corn, and different things. Then we had an opportunity with this property here in town and we started with birdseed, grass seed, straw and dog food, he said. The business expanded over the years as Porterfield remained on the lookout for more items and services. When something s your passion and you start a business for it, you re hungry for that. That s what you like to do, he said. Along with a variety of products, the convenience and speedy service also sets the store apart. The drive through makes it nice. You don t have to get out of your car. You can drive through and say I need a bag of birdseed or a bag of grass seed or whatever, and you re on your way. Or you can park in front and come in and talk about what you re working on. In terms of variety, he said customers range from large farmers, part time farmers or simply locals who live in town and enjoy feeding birds. Porterfield pointed out bales of straw and hay, barbed wire, pro mix, and diesel fuel heaters as some of the items local residents purchase. We have a nice customer base, he said. For the bad weather, we sell a lot of salt and also skids to the fellows that plow snow for different businesses. They stop and we know them. We know their name and we know their truck and we see them pulling in and we re on the forklift. In the big box stores it takes a long time to get loaded and on to the next job. Porterfield said the quality of customer service at the local level is a guiding principle at his business. We try to take care of people as soon as they come in. If we don t have what they need, we have resources to get a lot of different types of feed, he said. We unload stuff for people, he said. It can t be delivered to their home: they ll use our address and we ll unload it and they ll come over and pick it up. The feed store has three employees. Katrina Reynolds, a six year employee, has gotten to know Porterfield and the regulars. Kirke is a good guy. He would do anything for anybody, she said. I love my job. I love the customers. Our customers are great to me. I ve gotten Christmas gifts from our regular customers. The customers are wonderful. That s what keeps me coming back every day. Reynolds said the store does considerable repeat business. Ninety percent of them are my regulars, she said. There s a lot of them, but I know what they want, so I m already waiting by the skid when they pull in. Community involvement is another priority for Porterfield. Most recently through his membership in the St. Clairsville Rotary Club, he has helped arrange for banners honoring veterans to be hung on city poles. He also serves on community boards. Along with local buyers, Porterfield also supplies material to oil and gas interests. In addition, Porterfield is introducing the local area to a southern staple in coffee, carrying Community Coffee out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He added this is a favorite among oil and gas workers who come from the south. Along with the store, Porterfield works to keep his family s agricultural tradition alive. One of his sons maintains Porterfield s Fabrication Services on the farm northwest of St. Clairsville and manufactures items for local farmers and the oil and gas businesses. Another son operates the farm and 400 beef cows. We sell meat from our own cows here at the feed store, he said. It s all hamburger. It s all natural. No drugs or hormones you can tell the difference. Porterfield is also known for Kirke s Homemade Ice Cream, located above the feed store and active since 1992. Ice cream s a great business. It s enjoyable, he said. It s our own recipe. The drive through is open 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. The store is closed Sundays. For more information, call 740 695 6234. The drive through and ice cream stores are part of the Be Local network of local businesses. Be Local is the region s premier shop local promotion and education network.

Clairsville,"Officials comment on injection wells ST. CLAIRSVILLE Belmont County officials were disppointed and dismayed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources approval of a permit for New Jersey based Omni Energy Co. to place two saltwater injection wells at the intersection of U. S. 40 and Ohio 331. The Ohio Supreme Court had ordered ODNR to make a decision regarding the permit. This occurred after a lawsuit filed by Robert E. Bob Murray, who has since died, had delayed the process since April. Murray s filing argued that there should be a public hearing on the matter to allow nearby residents to voice their concerns. The coronavirus pandemic had prevented such a gathering, the High Court ruled that such a meeting was not required. The Richland Township trustees previously tabled a request from Omni Energy to allow ingress from U. S. 40 onto Pickering Road, but Ohio Department of Transportation spokeswoman Lauren Borell confirmed that ODOT has granted Omni Energy a permit to make an access road for the site. Our only role in this was to review and consider their application for construction of an access drive to the injection well site, and to connect them to U. S. 40, she said. All the necessary information on the drive application was previously provided to us and reviewed. Once Omni provided those copies of ODNR permits that were recently approved, District 11 did issue a right of way permit for construction. This permit was handled as we would throughout the state. We issue probably thousands of permits each year. The Belmont County Board of Commissioners had also opposed the presence of wells at that site. I m disappointed that they came out with that decision, Commissioner Jerry Echemann said, adding the commissioners had relayed their concerns to ODNR and the opinion that the site was not suitable for wells. Unfortunately, they don t have to go by anything that we say. They can issue that permit as they like, and they did it without notifying us. We would have appreciated giving us a heads up a few days before, but we found out the same time as the rest of the general public, Echemann said. There s not much we can do. That s the way the law reads, but if ODNR feels it s geologically possible to have an injection well at that site, they can give approval, which is what they did. I understand the need to have business, but I wish they d have found a better location. I m not thrilled about where they re going to put that, St. Clairsville Mayor Kathryn Thalman said. It s out of the city limits. There s nothing we can do about it. Thalman expressed concerns about road damage due to increased traffic, as well as the possibility of accidents. Omni officials have said all precautions will be taken and the company intends to proceed quickly. The company could be ready to apply for a permit to operate the wells by late spring or early summer. "

Clairsville,"Unified Bank carries on tradition of caring MARTINS FERRY Unified Bank and its employees contributed more than 11,000 to local charities through its payroll deduction plan. Every year employees of Unified Bank contribute money from their own paychecks to causes represented by the United Way of the Upper Ohio Valley. Employees have the option each year to donate a percentage of each week s paycheck to various foundations in the valley through the United Way s payroll deduction plan. Stacy Carpino, retail banking executive for Unified Bank, said it s one of the ways the bank and its employees give back to the community. Carpino is a mortgage and personal loan provider for Unified in Martins Ferry, Bridgeport and St. Clairsville. Some of the folks in the areas we serve need our help, and our Unified Team is glad to be able to provide this through our paychecks. We simply agree to an amount at the beginning of the year, and that amount is taken out every pay, she added. This year, Unified team members contributed 6,448 to the United Way, along with another 5,000 that Unified Bank contributed, bringing the total donation to 11,448. Jessica Rine, executive director of the United Way of the Upper Ohio Valley, said people need an affordable way to give back to their communities, and the payroll deduction campaign offers just that. The United Way is blessed to have caring companies and caring employees, like our friends at Unified Bank, who give so generously, she said.

Clairsville,"News, Sports, Jobs - The Times Leader ST. CLAIRSVILLE Gov. Mike DeWine continues to ask Ohio nursing home workers to get vaccinated against COVID 19. We ve made nursing homes a priority because over half our deaths in the state of Ohio have occurred in nursing homes. Our goal is to get as many people in nursing homes residents as well as those who work in nursing homes the opportunity to take the shot as quickly as they can, DeWine said. He said 61 percent of Ohio nursing homes have been visited by those who are administering vaccinations. Several staffers were vaccinated during the governor s broadcast on Tuesday. DeWine said about 40 percent of nursing home staff members have opted to take the first shot. He said about 75 percent to 80 percent of residents of those homes have been vaccinated. On Friday, some nursing homes will be visited a second time for a follow up dose. Ursel McElroy, director of the Ohio Department of Aging, said nursing home employees have been hesitant for a variety of reasons, including fear of side effects and concerns about the shots safety and effectiveness due to the newness of the vaccine. We are reasonably concerned that given any refusal or delay of vaccination reduces our goal of widespread compliance, and it compromises our ability to eradicate this virus. We re hoping to see those numbers climb, McElroy said, adding that her office is reaching out with expert testimony. DeWine said statewide, there were close to 1 million people in the 1A vaccination group, which included home health workers, hospice workers, emergency medical service responders, primary care practitioners, free standing emergency department employees, urgent care site workers, pharmacy workers, dialysis and dental providers, and mobile unit practitioners. Belmont County Deputy Health Commissioner Robert Sproul announced that his office is beginning Phase 1B of the vaccination effort. People eligible in Phase 1B include Ohioans age 65 and older, those living with severe congenital, developmental or early onset medical disorders, and adults who work in school systems. Those people can call the Health Department for an appointment at 740 695 1202, ext. 120. Recipients of the initial shot must receive a second dose in about 28 days. DeWine said statewide, there are well over 1 million people in the 1B category. The governor has said he hopes Ohio s students can resume in person schooling in March. There are about 300,000 kindergarten through 12th grade staff eligible for the vaccine. Belmont County Senior Services Director Dwayne Pielech said his department is not administering the vaccines, but there is considerable enthusiasm among area senior citizens who want to receive the shot. We ve been getting calls at the agency seniors calling, confused, Pielech said. I think there s some impression out there that we have something to do with coordinating the vaccines, which we don t. We re not a medical provider. We don t do anything like that. Sproul said Phase 1B vaccines will be administered by appointment only next week at the Wise Building at the Belmont County Fairgrounds, located along Roscoe Road west of St. Clairsville. Personally, I would encourage a senior to get the vaccination, especially if they have health risk, but really it ends up being a personal decision between them and their family members and their family doctor, Pielech said. As an agency director, we re still in anticipation of our front line workers (getting vaccinated). We ve got workers questioning, When are we going to be able to get the vaccination? We haven t heard anything yet. We like to believe we re part of the front line workers. We re serving 11,00 meals a day, he said, adding his staff also includes drivers who transport seniors to medical appointments. Sproul reports that Belmont County has confirmed 3,937 cases of COVID 19 among its residents since the pandemic s onset. He said 968 people are isolated at home with active cases Tuesday compared to 1,024 on Monday, and 2,857 recoveries Tuesday compared to 2,738 at the beginning of the week. Sproul said 37 people are hospitalized with the virus, and he reported that deaths associated with the virus increased from 73 to 75, with the latest victims being men in their 70s and 60s. "

Clairsville,"St. Clairsville Mayor Kathryn Thalman Shares Post Referring to ‘Liberals’ as ‘Communists’ on Social Media ST. CLAIRSVILLE During a tumultuous time when Americans are divided along political lines, city residents are expressing concerns about a post Mayor Kathryn Thalman apparently shared on Facebook. The post features a picture of conservative commentator Candace Owens and the following quote: We need to stop calling them liberals and begin referring to them as exactly what they are: American communists that wish to partake in the destruction of western civilization. The post on Thalman s personal Facebook page is dated Dec. 29 and appears without context or further explanation. Thalman did not respond to multiple requests to confirm or deny that she shared the post. She could not be reached at her home or office for comment Thursday. As of Thursday evening, the post had garnered dozens of comments. What a terrible post, Carol Baron Johnson wrote. Wow. This is from the mayor? Shame on you! Shame on you! Tracey Lancione Lloyd wrote. Deplorable post from an elected official, Dawn McCroskey wrote. Other comments called for Thalman s resignation. When contacted about the matter, two city leaders responded. This latest posting by the mayor of St. Clairsville is very disappointing, disgusting and totally uncalled for. She should be ashamed of herself for posting such a divisive and slanderous post. At this point in time, this city and nation is in great need of a strong, moral and effective leadership, Councilman Frank Sabatino stated in a text message. I ve received phone calls from citizens regarding the post that was shared by the mayor and they re very upset. As city officials, we re elected to represent all citizens, and not just those who agree with our political views. As elected officials, we re actually held to a higher standard and should avoid posting, sharing or commenting on political issues on social media that could be considered insulting or demeaning to others, Councilwoman Linda Jordan texted. Paul Nick, executive director of the Ohio Ethics Commission, was contacted and asked to provide copies of any guidelines it may have regarding elected officials. Nick said the commission deals with criminal matters and conflicts of interest. So they really don t speak to conduct that may be deemed offensive and inappropriate. They just don t cover it one way or the other, he said. That would be more of a local issue for the citizens, I suppose, or the council as a whole if it believed the officials was acting outside of whatever guidelines they ve imposed. There s nothing under the ethics laws that either permits or prohibits that kind of conduct. That s up to local authorities and local voters and local officials to address. "

Among the unpaid charges that the landlords claimed include insurance premiums, fire alarm inspection, common area maintenance, media and marketing funds and trash removal as well as rent. According to the separately filed lawsuits, the Cafaro landlords claim the Children s Place St. Clairsville store owes 49,656 the Clarksville, Tenn. , location, 68,152 the Barboursville, W. Va. , store, 98,758 the Dubuque, Iowa, location, 8,250 the Pyallup, Wash. , store, 67,349 the Erie, Pa. , location, 116,735 and the Spotsylvania, Va. , store, 141,935.

They began by selling toys, apparel and accessories before deciding that apparel had the most growth potential. By the early 1980s, The Children s Place was repositioned as a specialty retailer of children s apparel for newborns to preteens and began offering private label merchandise as well as branded product.

Burrillville,"Suspended Providence lawyer admits to collecting dead client's pension Katie Mulvaney kmulvane providencejournal. com PROVIDENCE A suspended Providence lawyer who once served as a town solicitor in Burrillville has admitted to illegally collecting more that 200,000 in pension funds for a deceased client for nearly a dozen years after the man's death. Oleg Nikolyszyn, 65, pleaded guilty before U. S. District Court Judge William E. Smith Friday to two counts of mail fraud and one of theft from an employee benefit pension fund for collecting 234,586 from December 2003 through September 2015 in the name of a former employee of the City of Providence who was a member of the Laborers' International Union of North America. Under the plea agreement terms, federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss nine other counts of aggravated identity theft and mail fraud and to recommend that he be sentenced to two years in prison. He could have faced up to 45 years behind bars and 750,000 in fines. A federal grand jury in July 2018 indicted Nikolyszyn on charges accusing him of collecting more than 234,000 in pension payments intended for a dead client. Nikolyszyn remains suspended from the practice of law in Rhode Island until further notice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, which suspended him in 2016 for serious professional misconduct following an investigation by the state disciplinary counsel. According to the agreement, the former Providence employee, identified as A. K. , hired Nikolyszyn in 2000, giving him the power of attorney to perform certain acts. Six months later, A. K. moved to Poland. In October 2011, Nikolyszyn directed the LIUNA fund to mail him the monthly checks for him to deposit in A. K. 's accounts. He requested, too, that he be sent checks from the City of Providence Employees' Retirement System that A. K. failed to received after his move to Poland. In total, Nikolyszyn admitted to collecting 173,597 from the City's retirement system and another 60,989 from the LIUNA fund, which he deposited in personal accounts he shared with his wife and children. Assistant U. S. Attorney Denise M. Barton prosecuted the case, with William C. Dimitri representing Nikolyszyn. kmulvane providencejournal. com kmulvane (401) 277 7417"
Burrillville,"Daniele, the artisan cured-meat maker in Burrillville, merges with Utah company Creminelli Gail Ciampa gciampa providencejournal. com BURRILLVILLE More big changes are ahead for Daniele, the Burrillville artisan producer of dry cured meats, as it grows and expands. Entrepreneurial Equity Partners, the Chicago based firm that bought the family business in September, announced today that Daniele has merged with another artisan producer, Creminelli Fine Meats of Salt Lake City, Utah. Financial terms were not disclosed. ""In the gourmet food world, this deal will turn heads,"" said David Dukcevich, part of the family that founded Daniele in 1976, and a sales and marketing executive for the company. Both companies will keep their own brands and identities, he said. They will share resources so each will be able to grow in a rapidly developing gourmet industry. Creminelli is a producer and distributor of premium charcuterie and protein snacks, whose lines include meat and cheese snack trays sold at local Starbucks cafes. They are also sold at Whole Foods Markets. Daniele sells its artisan prosciutto, salami and other meats to Costco, Trader Joe's and many other grocery stores and retailers. Like Daniele, Creminelli traces its roots to Italy, with founder Cristiano Creminelli s family. It, too, uses old world methods and modern technology for small batch production of meats that are popular with millennial customers who pick them up to eat on the run, said Dukcevich. Daniele is the older company, as Creminelli was founded 12 years ago. Daniele is also the larger on,e with 600 employees in Rhode Island at three plants, the largest a 100 million factory. The merger will not impact the employees, he said. Synergy is the word Dukcevich used to describe the deal. He foresees the two companies sharing facilities to let each grow faster. Though he couldn't say if they would share distribution, he did say they will share production facilities while each keeps its own flavor. ""Creminelli is very well known on the West Coast and we are strong on the East Coast,"" he said. ""It's all about additions. "" Over the years, Dukcevich said, he has met Cristiano Creminelli at food shows and admired his passion for the craft and the food. Daniele s CEO, David Finch, said in a statement that he is excited to be partnering with Creminelli.

Burrillville,"Rhode Island man facing multiple charges related to child exploitation BURRILLVILLE, R. I. (AP) A Rhode Island man is facing multiple charges related to exploiting children, police said. Xavier Lafleur, 19, of Burrillville, was charged on Monday with indecent solicitation of a child and possession of child pornography, among other charges, said police Maj. Dennis Leahey. Lafleur pleaded not guilty to unauthorized dissemination of indecent material, records show. Many of the charges were felonies, so Lafleur did not enter pleas to those charges. Police received a complaint that sparked an investigation of Lafleur in October, Leahey said. Officers eventually alerted authorities in Warwick about adults there who might have connections to Lafleur. Warwick police are actively investigating the case. Police did not provide details about the victims in the case or the allegations. Lafleur s bail was set at 10,000. Lafleur was referred to the public defender s office. He has not been appointed an attorney who would be able to comment on his behalf. (Copyright (c) 2022 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Burrillville,"Raimondo orders 100% clean electricity Alex Kuffner akuffner providencejournal. com PROVIDENCE Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order on Friday that sets Rhode Island on the path to getting all of the state s electric supply from renewable sources by the end of the decade. While Rhode Island is not the first state to adopt a 100% renewables target, the timeline put forth by Raimondo is the most aggressive in the nation. In a speech before the signing, the governor said that transforming the state's energy system is needed to fight climate change, and she took issue with a recent statement by House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello in which he discounted the impact of any action Rhode Island could take. The governor first announced the plan in her State of the State address on Tuesday, framing the transition away from fossil fuels within the climate crisis, and she took up that argument again in the State House ceremony on Friday. The bad news is climate change is real, urgent, closing in on us, she said. The good news is Rhode Island is a leader in the fight against climate change. Today is about maintaining our leadership position and pushing ourselves to do more, go faster. Her position stands in contrast to Mattiello's, who said on Wednesday during a panel hosted by the Boston Globe that change can happen only at the national and international levels. There s nothing Rhode Island can do to address climate change in a way that s real or impactful, he said in part, according to the Globe and the website UpriseRI. In a pointed response, Raimondo said Friday, There are some who say, 'Rhode Island doesn t have a role in this it s a national issue. ' That could not be more wrong. She referred to the lack of action at the national level by the Trump administration and the president's statements playing down the effects of climate change. That s wrong, she said. It s factually wrong, scientifically wrong, economically wrong and morally wrong. The Environment Council of Rhode Island, which represents nearly all of the state's major environmental organizations, also disputed Mattiello's contention. Investing in climate resilience will not only protect our communities and shorelines, it will also grow our economy,"" Meg Kerr, senior policy director at the Audubon Society of Rhode Island, said in a statement issued by the environmental council. ""But this will require leadership from policymakers at every level of government local, state, and federal. There s no excuse for Rhode Island to watch from the sidelines. We need to step up and do our part because Rhode Islanders will also suffer the consequences of inaction. Mattiello was not at the signing ceremony. Neither was R. I. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio or other legislative leaders. But there were dozens of members of state environmental groups, including Save The Bay and The Nature Conservancy, and representatives of renewable energy developers, such as offshore wind company Orsted. Michael Sabitoni, president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, also attended. Priscilla De La Cruz, president of the environment council, said its member groups support the governor s order. We see this as a step towards addressing the climate crisis, but we should be doing a lot more, she said. In the immediate term, that means rewriting the state Renewable Energy Standard to drive more development of solar and wind projects, and making the emissions reduction goals enshrined in the Resilient Rhode Island Act mandatory and enforceable, she said. Jerry Elmer, senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation, who helped lead the successful fight against a large fossil fuel burning power plant proposed in Burrillville, said something similar. The governor must now make good on her promise to support a law that goes beyond mere talk and makes Rhode Island s climate goals mandatory, including slashing emissions beyond the electric sector, he said in a statement. Timmons Roberts, Ittleson Professor of Environmental Studies at Brown University and co author of a recent study that set out ways to quickly decarbonize the Rhode Island energy system, described Raimondo s plan as meaningful. I think this is really something, because it s a target that s at the level that we actually need to be getting to, according to science, he said. The electricity sector is 25% roughly of our state emissions. It s one slice, but it s a key slice if we re going to electrify everything else, like building heat, hot water heaters and transportation. We re going to need clean electricity to replace all that natural gas and heating oil and gasoline. The order directs the state Office of Energy Resources to develop a plan by the end of the year to achieve the goal. The plan will include any legislative and regulatory changes that would be needed. The state has already started advertising for a consultant to work with the energy office, and a selection is expected to be made in February, according to Nicholas Ucci, acting state energy commissioner. One key piece of the analysis will be determining how much electricity will be needed when accounting for such factors as energy efficiency and electrification of the transportation and heating sectors, Ucci told The Journal earlier this week. Another will be in figuring out where all the power will come from. Offshore wind will surely contribute. So, too, will solar farms in rural areas. But how much energy can come from solar panels mounted on rooftops or installed on tough to develop brownfields sites? Raimondo acknowledged the questions about her order, but said that by setting the bar high, it will force the necessary changes. I know it s ambitious, the most ambitious in America, she said. I believe we ll get there. akuffner providencejournal. com (401) 277 7457"
Burrillville,"Keeping heat on in Rhode Island Staff Writer The Providence Journal A year ago this week, a natural gas outage left 7,455 people in Newport and Middletown without heat for days in fiercely cold weather. People, some frail and elderly, had to leave their homes to the ravages of winter. Pipes burst, causing significant damage. It would be nice to think that Rhode Island leaders have since stepped in to prevent this from happening again. But that may not be the case. I m convinced another such disaster could occur, state Sen. Louis DiPalma, D Middletown, told Newport Daily News reporter Sean Flynn ( Officials say island wide gas outage could happen again, news, Jan. 21). We need a resilient and reliable gas infrastructure, and we don t have that yet. That s what we re working towards, Senator DiPalma said. This is something we have spoken of repeatedly in recent years. Rhode Island relies on natural gas for heat and electricity, and will for the foreseeable future. Yet policymakers have done a poor job of making sure that constituents will have access to affordable and abundant energy. Last week, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order declaring that Rhode Island will have 100% renewable sources for electricity within 10 years. To be sure, it is important that we move on from fossil fuels as quickly as we can, but her order had something of the quality of King Canute s fabled demand that the tides obey him. In the real world, we confront forces that cannot be controlled by political proclamations, especially ones that stretch out far beyond an elected term. Unless there is some unforeseen technological breakthrough, it appears that people will have to depend on natural gas (which at least is cleaner than coal and oil) for some time to come. It powers 49% of the electricity generation in New England, with nuclear providing another 30%. Renewables are far behind at 10.4%, and require a backup. Wind and solar power, which are costly, cannot yet be counted on when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine. A great deal of solar power requires a great deal of real estate. Meanwhile, older electricity generation facilities are rapidly going offline, while politics are preventing the construction of cleaner, more efficient new ones. Rhode Island last year rejected a 1 billion state of the art plant in Burrillville. Getting natural gas to the region remains a problem. Old and problem plagued pipelines transmit natural gas to New England, but at a steep cost. Meanwhile, the region and New York have blocked new pipelines that could transmit cheap natural gas from Pennsylvania. Last year s cutoff had to do with malfunctioning equipment in Providence and Weymouth, Massachusetts, leading to a dangerous reduction in pressure. It is hoped that a patchwork system using a temporary liquefied natural gas facility in Portsmouth will help in case of a repeat. But it seems clear that a more thorough analysis of our system is in order. A loss of heat in the dead of winter can be a life or death matter. That is why we are glad that Senator DiPalma announced he will be chairing a special legislative commission evaluating the state s electric and natural gas transmission and distribution system. It s not very sexy politically to focus on making sure existing systems work. But that is a crucial part of governing effectively and providing responsible leadership. "
Burrillville,"53 years later, a soldier's sacrifice recognized Staff Writer The Providence Journal I told Ernie Boisvert, Welcome home. It s been 53 years but few people said that to soldiers like him, returning from Vietnam. It s one of the reasons the war is still unfinished business for Ernie, now 73. But there s another, which is what brought me to sit down with him on Tuesday. It s what happened on May 22, 1967, when he was wounded as the Fourth Infantry was under attack in the jungle near Pleiku. A half century later, his sacrifice is finally to be recognized with the Purple Heart he never received. His story, though, has another level I didn t expect. It s a glimpse into the internal struggle many veterans face decades after war. Because he is a soldier at heart, although retired, Ernie still works as the volunteer adjutant for the Rhode Island DAV Disabled American Veterans. He spent his career in quality control for manufacturing companies until 11 years ago when, in ways he was not even aware of himself, Vietnam caught up to him. He found himself depressed and so full of anxiety it became hard to function. Ernie had been drafted with around 20 other Rhode Island young men on Dec. 1, 1965, and now he drove to see one of the many he remains close with Al Falcioni, former Woonsocket assistant fire chief. The two served together, and were in the same battle when Ernie was wounded. Falcioni recognized what Boisvert was going through. He told his friend he should go to the PTSD Clinic at the Providence VA Medical Center. Soon Ernie was with a psychiatrist and today, he is still helped with medications for anxiety, depression and sleep the last because of frequent war nightmares. He explained that part of PTSD is you can t stop thinking about things that happened. Like on that long ago May 22. He'd left for Vietnam eight months before with the same men he trained with. They were to become a close brotherhood. That made the losses especially hard. He became emotional as he told me some were kids from Rhode Island, including Allan McCutcheon and James Blanchard. In 2015, the state honored the two by naming a bridge on Route 102 in Burrillville after them. Ernie was there that day, as were 20 of their Vietnam buddies from around the country. In the middle of May 1967, the Fourth Infantry found itself in one of the most brutal battles of the war, captured in a recent book titled Nine Days in May. On May 22, Ernie Boisvert was in the middle of that battle, the Americans outnumbered and nearly surrounded. Ernie was in a foxhole with an M16 rifle as mortars and enemy fire came in. He heard the cries of wounded, and more cries for medics and ammo. He was shoulder to shoulder with his lieutenant, Harold Ford of Pittsburgh, who briefly looked up over the foxhole to see if any of his troops needed help. Just then, an RPG came out of the jungle and took part of his head off. Shrapnel hit Ernie Boisvert in the face. I was 20 years old and single, he told me. He was married and I believe had a kid. He had more to live for than I did then. I still have guilt. That moment is the main mental movie from Vietnam that keeps running in his mind. When the battle ended Ernie was among the many wounded taken by helicopter to a nearby field hospital. As he got to the triage nurse, she told him they were so overwhelmed with critical patients they couldn t get to him. Boisvert, who d been patched up on the way in, simply went back to his unit on the base so there was no record of his being wounded. Ernie decided to leave it at that. Then in 2017, the book on the battle came out, including a vivid scene on the death of Lt. Harold Ford told by a soldier in an adjoining bunker. Ernie wasn t mentioned, and it left him thinking he was a missing puzzle piece from a moment in the war s history. Meanwhile, at reunions, his fellow soldiers pushed him to seek the Purple Heart he deserved. With a new grandson, he also thought it would be an important part of their family legacy. Finally, he contacted Rep. David Cicilline s veterans liaison, who filed paperwork for a Purple Heart with the Department of Defense. It was turned down because there was no medical record. But a year later, another Cicilline aide pushed again and was told it might go through with two eyewitnesses. Ernie gave names, including Bill Lomnecki, now 74, retired from the auto parts business and living in Levittown, New York. I called Lomnecki who remembered being at the field hospital base that May 22 when helicopters began arriving with battle wounded. They were medevacing those guys in like crazy, he told me. Then his friend Ernie Boisvert arrived. I remember he was bleeding, Lomnecki said. He caught a piece of shrapnel. We were temporarily able to patch his face. He felt Ernie needed more attention so he sent him to the hospital. Lomnecki assumed Ernie got a Purple Heart and was shocked to hear at one of their recent reunions that it never went through. He deserved it, said Lomnecki. He shed blood for his country. With the witness testimony, the Department of Defense recently authorized it. Congressman Cicilline will award the medal at 10 a. m. on Feb. 1 at Woonsocket s American Legion Post 85. To Ernie Boisvert, the moment won t be just for him. He hopes it will be recognition for all those who served their country in a long ago war too often forgotten. Resources for Veterans The U. S.

Burrillville,"Hearing on gun bills reveals distrust Katherine Gregg kgregg providencejournal. com PROVIDENCE The push to close the loopholes in state gun law that came to light after a man with a history of making suicidal and homicidal threats went on a shooting spree in Westerly in December with a newly purchased gun was met with distrust from gun rights activists at the State House on Wednesday. The state's top cop Col. James Manni, the head of the Rhode Island State Police assured the House Judiciary Committee that there was no underlying plan to create a gun registry from a proposed statewide records sharing system for local police departments, or to prohibit law abiding citizens from owning firearms made from parts as long as those that are operable carry serial numbers. Seeking to address ""the elephant in the room,"" Rep. Arthur Corvese, D North Providence, asked Manni: ""Do you foresee this as a precursor to . a statewide gun registry?"" Manni answered, ""No sir, I do not. "" But Republican Rep. David Place, of Burrillville, said to ""the folks in the Second Amendment community, the concern is . compromise, compromise, compromise. At some point, you lose the fight . and we are quickly approaching that point. ""A lot of folks who consider themselves pro Second Amendment are going to oppose even what on its face appears to be very common sense,'' he said, ""because there's a lack of trust. "" An hour later, Jennifer Moffat, of Warwick, demonstrated to the lawmakers how deep that distrust runs: ""The government is trying to A) register us, B) confiscate our guns, and completely and utterly undermine the Second Amendment . in little bits and pieces for years,'' she said. Talking about the creator of the first 3D printed ""ghost gun,'' she said: ""He did this for me. He made this technology for those of us who are losing our rights, who don't have another avenue to protect ourselves . and at some point, we are going to be I am going to be the person that's the criminal. ""I'm a mom who loves her children,'' she said. ""I will do anything to protect those children. . I am not a mom who is going to cower in a corner waiting for somebody else to come save me. I am not going to beg this panel and the people who write bills to allow me to have the right . to protect my house, my children. I have a right to protect myself. ""And the thing is, these ghosts guns, you know what they are? They are the unintended consequence of what you have done over the years. You have pushed the limit . until people like me have no other option,"" she told the lawmakers. ""I don't want to be a criminal. But you're gong to make me a criminal and guess what . I'll do what I have to do. So this is on you. We wouldn't need these ghosts guns and these 3D guns if you would leave our rights alone,'' she said to applause from other yellow T shirt wearing gun rights activists in the room. On the other side of the debate, Norine Duncan, of Pawtucket, told the legislators in writing: ""I am a mother and a grandmother. I am fortunate that no one in my family has been directly affected by the epidemic of gun violence in the United States. Nevertheless . Rhode Island citizens have a right to be safe, especially in public places. "" Added Ramsey Davis, from Cranston: ""I am a Marine Corps Vietnam veteran . an infantry man, radio man and Vietnamese interpreter. I carried an assault rifle and handgun. I am also a retired teacher of over 30 years. I am here because i am concerned for my 7 year old first grader grandson's future and the future of all young people. '' Gov. Gina Raimondo, state Treasurer Seth Magaziner and Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea all urged action in writing or in person on the trio of bills up for hearing. One of the three bills aims to remove any doubt that applications to buy firearms in Rhode Island go to the hometown or home city police chief of the person seeking to buy the weapon. The ambiguity came to light after the Westerly shooter, Joseph Giachello, killed one person and injured two after turning the gun on himself in December. Had he seen Giachello's application to buy the gun he used in his rampage from a Richmond gun dealer, Westerly police chief Shawn Lacey said it might have sparked further inquiry, given his department's interactions with Giachello. A second bill would set the stage for records sharing by the police departments across Rhode Island that do not now have an easy way of checking incident and accident reports, arrests, citations, warrants and other ""field contacts"" in other communities. A third bill which is unrelated to the Westerly case but a high priority to the state's top cops would outlaw 3D printed guns and other so called ""ghost guns'' that enable felons and others to get untraceable firearms. A version of the bill is headed to the full Senate for a vote next week after winning the blessings of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday night. "
Burrillville,"Legal Profession Blog Thursday, January 23, 2020 The Rhode Island Supreme Court accepted a suspended attorney's consent to disbarment. Providence Journal reported A suspended Providence lawyer who once served as a town solicitor in Burrillville has admitted to illegally collecting more that 200,000 in pension funds for a deceased client for nearly a dozen years after the man s death. Oleg Nikolyszyn, 65, pleaded guilty before U. S. District Court Judge William E. Smith Friday to two counts of mail fraud and one of theft from an employee benefit pension fund for collecting 234,586 from December 2003 through September 2015 in the name of a former employee of the City of Providence who was a member of the Laborers International Union of North America. Under the plea agreement terms, federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss nine other counts of aggravated identity theft and mail fraud and to recommend that he be sentenced to two years in prison. He could have faced up to 45 years behind bars and 750,000 in fines. A federal grand jury in July 2018 indicted Nikolyszyn on charges accusing him of collecting more than 234,000 in pension payments intended for a dead client. Nikolyszyn remains suspended from the practice of law in Rhode Island until further notice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, which suspended him in 2016 for serious professional misconduct following an investigation by the state disciplinary counsel. According to the agreement, the former Providence employee, identified as A. K. , hired Nikolyszyn in 2000, giving him the power of attorney to perform certain acts. Six months later, A. K. moved to Poland. In October 2011, Nikolyszyn directed the LIUNA fund to mail him the monthly checks for him to deposit in A. K. s accounts. He requested, too, that he be sent checks from the City of Providence Employees Retirement System that A. K. failed to received after his move to Poland. In total, Nikolyszyn admitted to collecting 173,597 from the City s retirement system and another 60,989 from the LIUNA fund, which he deposited in personal accounts he shared with his wife and children. Assistant U. S. Attorney Denise M. Barton prosecuted the case, with William C. Dimitri representing Nikolyszyn.

Burrillville,"Who will win the lottery to run Rhode Island's six new medical marijuana dispensaries? PROVIDENCE David Spradin is the CEO of a California based marijuana company called Perfect Union. It has 14 marijuana stores between Los Angeles and Sacramento and six stores in New Mexico, and the company has had stores in Oregon and Washington, says Rick McAuliffe, a Rhode Island lobbyist who now also serves as a director for Spradin s new local affiliate: Perfect Union RI. The company and 27 other businesses all filed applications last month for a chance to run one of six new medical marijuana dispensaries planned for Rhode Island. While Spradin s local venture incorporated just in November, the Californian has been around, buying up one marijuana cultivation operation in Warwick and purchasing a Providence site for a possible second indicators of the interest some outside investors have with Rhode Island s booming, multimillion dollar marijuana industry. Spradin s Western stores sell in both the recreational and medical markets, and he thinks the opportunity in Rhode Island and the Northeast is very good, says McAuliffe, particularly if Rhode Island joins several Northeast states and legalizes recreational use of the drug. He wants to be a presence here, says McAuliffe. I think we all see that at some point this will go recreational. The new year promises to bring renewed focus on marijuana in Rhode Island. The state is moving forward with the first expansion of its medical marijuana dispensaries since the existing three in Providence, Warwick and Portsmouth opened in 2013 and 2014. The new dispensaries will operate in six geographical zones around the state, an effort to improve access for patients and promote price competition. The Raimondo administration has proposed choosing the winners of the new dispensary licenses by a lottery held in public and perhaps even televised to keep political favoritism and influence out of the process. In total, the 28 businesses filed 45 separate applications, with several applying in multiple zones to increase their odds of winning a license. (Winners are limited to operating one dispensary. ) Several lobbyists and former lawmakers, outgoing Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, and Providence School Board president Nicholas J. Hemond, a lawyer, are among the listed directors of some of those businesses. What s in play is more than just the chance to sell medical marijuana. The winners of the six new licenses, along with the three existing dispensaries, could have first dibs on selling recreational marijuana, too, if lawmakers allow adult use. Gov. Gina Raimondo has pushed for legalization since 2019. Her latest plan would have the state contracting with retail stores. The state would regulate prices and the potency of marijuana products sold. The state would take 61% of revenue, store operators 29% and hosting communities 10%. Raimondo's budget officials estimate 176,388 consumers in the adult use market and 209.6 million in annual sales. It's unclear at the moment if, or how, Raimondo's pending departure to Washington to serve as commerce secretary will alter the marijuana equation. Lt. Gov. Dan McKee, who will become Rhode Island's next governor, has said the time has come for legalization provided it is properly regulated. Medical marijuana sales have been smashing records every year recently. And with 2020 the year the coronavirus kept many people at home that trend is expected to continue. In 10 months, from January through October, Rhode Island saw 65,190,150 in sales at its three dispensaries, reports the Department of Business Regulation. In the fiscal year that ended last June 30, those dispensaries sold 59.7 million worth of marijuana products. Whether legalization will pass this year remains unclear. While Senate President Dominick Ruggerio has dropped his objection, the new House speaker, K. Joseph Shekarchi, D Warwick, wants the issue debated. I don t have a particular stance either way, he said last month. It s a hard issue. Let it go through the normal legislative process. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use, including Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine and New Jersey s legislature just last month. The DBR has said it will announce when the lottery will happen after its office reviews the license applications. All eligible candidates for the lottery must meet a host of requirements, including disclosing all investors and ownership interests, and showing they have local community approval to operate a dispensary. The dispensaries must be incorporated as nonprofits, at least on paper, but many marijuana companies contract with management companies that direct revenue streams back to shareholders. The new dispensaries will be retail stores only, though any license winners who are now marijuana cultivators supplying existing dispensaries would be allowed to merge operations. The following is a list of license applicants for each zone. Zone 1: Burrillville, Cumberland, Glocester, North Smithfield, Smithfield and Woonsocket. Livity Compassion Center, Medici Compassionate Care Center, New Leaf Compassion Center, Pinnacle Compassion Center and RMI Compassion Center.

Burrillville,"Climate science demands a halt to Killingly power plant When the COVID 19 pandemic first hit our state hard Gov. Ned Lamont appeared wearing a mask that read Science Will Win. In his approach to COVID 19, Lamont has relied unceasingly on scientific data, sought close collaboration with neighboring states, and communicated important information to the public. Guided by science, he is demonstrating exemplary leadership in navigating the pandemic. Contrast this COVID 19 response to climate science and fossil fuel policy in Connecticut. It is obvious that science is not winning. Although there has been important progress in the creation of renewable energy sources and decreasing energy demand, as well as a recently announced multi state plan to address carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the transportation sector, fossil fuel infrastructure in Connecticut continues to expand. Most glaring, we are facing the imminent build out of the Killingly Energy Center, KEC, a 650 MW natural gas power plant in northeastern Connecticut that is not needed, at a cost of over 600 million. How can this be? Science has established fossil fuels as the primary cause of global warming. KEC would knee cap any chance of reaching Lamont s goal of 100% carbon free power by 2040. At full capacity, KEC would produce 2.2 million tons of CO2 annually, or 13% of Connecticut s CO2 emissions. The backer of this plant, NTE, claims KEC has value as a bridge fuel to provide energy when the sun doesn t shine and the wind doesn t blow. This decades old justification was refuted in 2019 by Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) Commissioner Katie Dykes at the annual conference of the League of Conservation Voters. The commissioner declared, Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a bridge fuel. There is demonstrable evidence that Connecticut does not need a new fossil fuel power plant. Electricity use in Connecticut has flattened in recent years, primarily due to increased efficiency. In addition, Independent Systems Operator New England (ISO NE), the electricity grid manager for six states, reported an excess region wide system capacity for 2018 of over 1,000 MW, even without accounting for growing solar and wind contributions. Furthermore, at the current rate of technological advancement in carbon free energy generation and power storage, KEC could soon become a toxic dinosaur. Concerned residents of Killingly and a growing network of advocates throughout the state have opposed KEC since its inception. By the time Lamont took office, plans for the project were well underway. In late 2019, Lamont expanded the Governor s Council on Climate Change (GC3), and charged the council with formulation of comprehensive climate recommendations. The GC3 offered the prospect of a hard look at fossil fuel policy in the state. Therefore, I was eager to set eyes on the recently released final report of the GC3 s Electricity Working Group. I was stunned by how the report addresses KEC: Connecticut soon will be home to the Killingly Energy Center . (Chapter 4, Electricity, page 79). How could KEC possibly be presented in terms equivalent to what I would call a done deal? One glaring reason to object to the assertion is that there is an outstanding permit application with arguably substantive environmental issues still to be aired in a public forum. In addition, there is a KEC related case pending before the State Supreme Court. Either could bring a halt to the project. As further basis for incredulity, the GC3 report admits that KEC does not align with Connecticut s decarbonization policy objectives and its long asset life will make it challenging to meet the state s emissions reduction goals. And remarkably, the GC3 text on KEC acknowledges, Throughout development of this report, stakeholders indicated their strong objections to this project KEC because the plant will lock in decades of carbon emissions and will negatively impact the health and well being of the surrounding community. Who, then, authored the text that presents KEC as a done deal? I don t know the answer. What I do know is that membership of the Electricity Working Group is impressively weighted toward gas companies, with DEEP staff as chair.

DONATE It is unfortunate that the administration preceding Lamont left him a legacy of active expansion of natural gas in Connecticut. But the inevitable environmental impacts of this plant coming on line demand action now. Partly through satellite images, we have been alerted to massive leaks of methane both from the process of fracking to obtain natural gas, and the transmission and burning of natural gas to produce electricity. Since methane is at least 25 times more potent than CO2 in contribution to global warming, these leaks are huge red flags. Why then allow KEC to go forward? Both Commissioner Dykes and the GC3 report place responsibility for KEC on the Connecticut Siting Council and ISO New England. In contradiction, a recent statement by ISO NE spokesperson Matt Kakley made clear that the state not the ISO determines if a plant gets developed within its borders. Dykes blame game demonstrates a blind eye toward KEC and its harms. Governor Lamont has stated, I don t think we need KEC for Connecticut I m trying to figure out whether we need the plant at all, and indicated his intention to confer with neighbor state governors. Notably, at the same time that KEC got the initial go ahead, application was denied for a new gas plant in Burrillville, Rhode Island. And at that time, Rhode Island s Gov. Gina Raimondo stated it was not needed. I join many others who have worked for years to oppose KEC in saying NO. This plant, as well as further expansion of fossil fuels in Connecticut, must be stopped. Connecticut residents need the GC3 to exhort Governor Lamont, and Connecticut s legislators as well, to say NO to KEC. I want to live in a state where climate science wins, and policy is determined by what we know about the toxic role of fossil fuels. Going forward with KEC would amount to climate denial as glaring as the COVID 19 denial seen in the refusal to wear a mask or to observe physical distancing. The GC3 and DEEP have a duty to act. Respectfully, I implore them to compel Governor Lamont in every possible way to do the right thing, in accord with climate science, and stop the Killingly fracked gas power plant.

Burrillville,"Who will win the lottery to run Rhode Island's six new medical marijuana dispensaries? David Spradin is the CEO of a California based marijuana company called Perfect Union. It has 14 marijuana stores between Los Angeles and Sacramento, six stores in New Mexico and has had stores in Oregon and Washington, says Rick McAuliffe, a Rhode Island lobbyist who now also serves as a director for Spradin s new local affiliate: Perfect Union RI. The company and 27 other businesses all filed applications last month for a chance to run one of six new medical marijuana dispensaries planned for Rhode Island. While Spradin s local venture incorporated just in November, the Californian has been around, buying up one marijuana cultivation operation, in Warwick, and purchasing a Providence site for a possible second indicators of the interest some outside investors have with Rhode Island s booming, multimillion dollar marijuana industry. Spradin s Western stores sell in both the recreational and medical markets and he thinks the opportunity in Rhode Island and the Northeast is very good, says McAuliffe, particularly if Rhode Island joins several Northeast states and legalizes recreational use of the drug. He wants to be a presence here, says McAuliffe. I think we all see that at some point this will go recreational. The new year promises to bring renewed focus on marijuana in Rhode Island. The state is moving forward with the first expansion of its medical marijuana dispensaries since the existing three located in Providence, Warwick and Portsmouth opened in 2013 and 2014. The new dispensaries will operate in six geographical zones around the state, an effort to improve access for patients and promote price competition. The Raimondo administration has proposed choosing the winners of the new dispensary licenses by a lottery held in public and perhaps even televised to keep political favoritism and influence out of the process. In total, the 28 hopeful businesses filed 45 separate applications as several applied for multiple zones to increase their odds of winning a license. (Winners are limited to operating one dispensary. ) Several lobbyists and former lawmakers, outgoing Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, and Providence School Board president Nicholas J. Hemond, a lawyer, are among the listed directors for some of those businesses. What s in play is more than just the chance to sell medical marijuana. The winners of the six new licenses, along with the three existing dispensaries, could have first dibs on selling recreational marijuana, too, if lawmakers allow adult use. Gov. Gina Raimondo has pushed for legalization since 2019. Her latest plan would have the state contracting with retail stores. The state would regulate prices and the potency of marijuana products sold. The state would take 61% of revenue, store operators 29% and hosting communities 10%. Raimondo's budget officials estimate 176,388 consumers in the adult use market and 209.6 million in annual sales. Medical marijuana sales have been smashing records every year as of late. And with 2020 the year the coronavirus kept tens of thousands of people at home that trend is expected to continue. In 10 months, from January through October, Rhode Island saw 65,190,150 in sales at its three dispensaries, reports the Department of Business Regulation. In the fiscal year that ended last June 30, those dispensaries sold 59.7 million worth of marijuana products. Whether legalization passes this year remains unclear. While Senate President Dominick Ruggerio has dropped his previous objection, the presumptive next House speaker, K. Joseph Shekarchi, D Warwick, wants the issue debated. I don t have a particular stance either way, he said last month. It s a hard issue. Let it go through the normal legislative process. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use, including Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, and New Jersey s legislature just last month. The DBR has said it will announce when the lottery will happen after its office reviews the license applications. All eligible candidates for the lottery must meet a host of requirements, including disclosing all investors and ownership interests, and showing they have local community approval to operate a dispensary. The dispensaries must be incorporated as non profits, at least on paper, but many marijuana companies contract with management companies that direct revenue streams back to shareholders. The new dispensaries will be retail stores only, though any license winners who are now marijuana cultivators supplying existing dispensaries would be allowed to merge operations. So far the DBR has released just the names of those businesses who submitted applications. A DBR spokesman said Monday that the department planned to release more information about each applicant closer to when the lottery happens. The following is a list of license applicants for each zone. Zone 1: Burrillville, Cumberland, Glocester, North Smithfield, Smithfield and Woonsocket.

Beville,"Homeless safe zone outside new shelter in limbo Eileen Zaffiro Kean eileen. zaffiro kean news jrnl. com DAYTONA BEACH After many debates about whether there should be an outdoor safe zone for homeless people in front of the new First Step Shelter, plans for a temporary holding area are still up in the air. In an email sent Friday to First Step Shelter Board members, First Step Executive Director Victoria Fahlberg wrote that the (city) manager has decided to not move forward with building it. Fahlberg said Monday she doesn t know the details behind the decision, which she learned about in an email last week from a city employee. We ve been waiting for them for a plan, she said. He said for now it s on hold. The city manager s decision is likely to spark more discussion Wednesday when the six member board that oversees the shelter on the city s western edge meets for the first time since the refuge for homeless adults opened Dec. 16. A major reason some local governments contributed their money to First Step Shelter is to have access to a safe zone where homeless people can stay when they don t want to have anything to do with the programs and rules inside or all the beds are occupied. Daytona Beach has had an outdoor safe zone on Clyde Morris Boulevard near Beville Road for a few years, but it s only available for homeless people inside Daytona city limits. If there s no safe zone, Port Orange will be gone the next day, said First Step Shelter Board member Chase Tramont, also a Port Orange City Council member. There won t be another dime from Port Orange. Mayor Derrick Henry, who s president of the First Step Shelter Board, doesn t see the safe zone idea as dead now. Top city staff just seem to have solidified their decision not to pay for a safe zone, but that doesn t mean the shelter board can t come up with something it can afford, Henry said. I doubt I ll ask the City Commission to pay for it, Henry said Monday. I think the city has pretty much done its part financially. City commissioners would need to approve safe zone plans, but the mayor said he doesn t see that being a problem. He doesn t believe City Manager Jim Chisholm would be opposed either to the right plan. As a board, we ll just have to find our way how to do it, Henry said. There s probably a cheaper way to do it. If a police officer wants to arrest a homeless person who s engaged in a life sustaining activity such as sleeping or urinating somewhere they shouldn t, the officer needs to offer them the option of a shelter or safe zone. And under a legal precedent set by a landmark court case, a shelter isn t an option if it has the requirements First Step Shelter has. Even the safe zone has to have very low rule barriers for entry to be legally compliant. Up until last year, the vision for the shelter was a ""come as you are"" facility that would welcome most any person. But the closer it got to opening day, the more rules and limits were added to those who wanted to use First Step to get their lives back on track. The shelter, which is being run by Catholic Charities of Central Florida, is only accepting people who agree to criminal background checks, follow a long list of shelter rules and are committed to working with a case manager to get off the streets. The shelter has capacity for more than 100 residents, but mainly because of budget constraints is starting out with 40 beds. There are currently 20 shelter residents, 11 women and nine men, Fahlberg said Monday. That headcount is in line with the plan to slowly add residents. At their meeting Wednesday, shelter board members will discuss whether to open First Step Shelter to homeless people looking to get out of the cold for a night or two. Local architect John Hall, who designed the 15,820 square foot city owned shelter, estimates it would cost about 200,000 to build a fenced in safe zone along with a temperature controlled guard shack with WiFi. Adding some sort of security screening machine in front of the shelter, cameras, new landscaping to block the public s view of the safe zone and a cement pad to keep people from having to sit in soggy grass on rainy days have all been discussed as things needed for the holding area where people could stay for several hours if they chose. But the cost of adding all those things, along with an additional 150,000 per year to have a security guard watching the safe zone 24 hours a day, is too exorbitant for Tramont. Shelter funds have dwindled from more than 900,000 in September to about 341,000 now. But that figure could rapidly rise if the city of Daytona Beach sends the 400,000 set aside in its current budget for the shelter and the county government starts sending the funds it promised to match city expenditures up to 400,000 per year for five years. Spending 350,000 for a safe zone in the first year and at least 150,000 every year after is a needless waste of the shelter s limited dollars, Tramont said. From City Manager Jim Chisholm s perspective, I understand his point of view, Tramont said. I wouldn't expect Daytona to foot the bill. I think it's an outrageous cost. "" Chisholm did not return calls Monday seeking comment, and city spokeswoman Susan Cerbone did not respond to emailed questions about the safe zone. Tramont has never wanted the safe zone to be in front of the building, and he thinks a much simpler holding area would suffice. He suggests putting a fence around the patch of grass behind the shelter building and calling that the safe zone. ""I think it's way overboard to do a cement slab and overhead protection,"" Tramont said. ""I think it'll be marginally used at best. There will be no access to food or services. I can't imagine people opting to stay. "" If a safe zone is created, people would be free to leave at any time but could stay for well over 12 hours. People who enter the safe zone from 12:30 p. m. until midnight would have to leave by 8 a. m. the next day. Those who enter after midnight would have to leave by noon. Tramont thinks safe zone security could be handled with an employee or guard walking around the 10 acre property and monitoring the fenced in with a security camera. Tramont said it's absolutely essential that a safe zone is included somewhere on the shelter property. ""This has to happen. You've got to do it,"" he said. ""You've got to have the zone for the cities that were promised it. """
Beville,"Carjacking suspect who crashed into, killed 2 Wisconsin siblings identified as Reginald Harris Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood on Monday released the identity of the carjacking suspect who crashed into a vehicle and killed two siblings on I 95 near Daytona Beach last week. More:Siblings among 3 dead as carjacking suspect causes wrong way collision in Daytona Beach The suspect, Reginald Harris, 47, of Orlando, was also killed on the head on collision he caused shortly after 7 p. m. as he fled from law enforcement officials Dec. 29 near the southbound ramp that leads onto Beville Road and Interstate 4, officials said. Chitwood said the Wisconsin siblings, Domynick Milis, 21, and his sister, Danycka Milis, 18, were heading home after visiting a Christmas lights display at Daytona International Speedway. More:Siblings killed in Daytona I 95 crash missed exit after seeing Christmas lights at Speedway The siblings, who were following their family, missed their exit and had only traveled about 50 yards south on I 95 when Harris came barreling northbound in the southbound lanes and slammed into them, killing them on impact, Chitwood said. More:Many mourn Wisconsin siblings killed in I 95 crash near Daytona Beach by wrong way driver Harris had fled earlier from Flagler County deputies where a license plate reader had detected the car he had taken from a pizza delivery driver in Orlando at gunpoint Dec. 27. After a deputy spotted Harris in the parking lot of a Walmart in Palm Coast, he fled with his headlights off and headed south on I 95 at speeds of up to 120 mph, the sheriff said. After a Volusia County deputy tried to catch up to Harris, he braked after passing the Bellevue Avenue Extension overpass, made a U turn and drove north at 100 mph in the southbound lanes and collided with the siblings from Omro, Wisconsin, Chitwood said. For those who have been asking: This is who murdered Danycka and Domynck Milis on I 95, and injured Drake Milis and Kyley Larsen, Chitwood said in an email Monday. As he did in a press conference Dec. 30, Chitwood again listed Harris criminal background. Harris, whose driver s license was revoked in January 2000, had 50 felony charges with 18 convictions, and 42 misdemeanor charges with 20 convictions. He was in prison eight times, with the most recent being Sept. 15, 2020, Chitwood stated in his email. Known to commit multiple felony robberies with a firearm, home invasion with a firearm, aggravated assault, grand theft and drug possession, Chitwood wrote in his email. "

Hornellsville,"Steuben County deals with COVID-19 spike of 217 new cases, 7 deaths since Dec. 31 More than 200 new cases of COVID 19 were confirmed in Steuben County over the New Year's holiday weekend, and seven more people died from the virus, according to county health officials. The latest surge follows a trend across New York state, but there's no indication yet if the state will impose any new restrictions on the county. With 217 new positive cases identified since Friday, there are now 3,710 confirmed cases in the county, 586 of which are currently active, according to Steuben County Public Health. The biggest jump in cases occurred in the eastern end of the county, with 31 new cases in the City of Corning, 19 in the Town of Corning, 13 in the Town of Campbell, seven in the Village of Painted Post and five in the Village of South Corning. Related:New York expands COVID 19 vaccine distribution to more groups of essential workers There were also 20 positive cases confirmed in the City of Hornell, 11 in the Town of Hornellsville, 12 in the Village of Bath, 11 in the Town of Bath, and eight in the Village of Wayland. The results were not surprising, said county Public Health Director Darlene Smith. ""Many positive cases continue to come from participating in gatherings, specifically holiday events, Smith said. The day will come when we are able to gather with friends inside and without a mask, but we are not there yet. "" Seventy five of the affected individuals had contact with previously reported Steuben positives, while several were associated with nursing homes or area hospitals. Steuben County's positivity rate the number of confirmed cases as a percentage of people tested was 15% Monday and the 7 day rolling average was 9.1%, according to a state database. In response to a resurgence of COVID 19 since early fall, the state has designated certain specific areas as red, orange or yellow zones, with various levels of restriction in each. Parts of Chemung County, including the Elmira Horseheads area, are in an orange zone, which puts restrictions on what businesses and organizations can be open and how large gatherings can be. The Corning area in Steuben County was originally in a yellow zone, the least restrictive designation, but that was later lifted. Smith said she has no idea if the state will reimpose any restrictions in light of the latest virus numbers. ""We've been worried and wondering, but we haven't heard anything yet,"" she said. ""We have asked for clarification from the state on the formula or metrics they use. We have not gotten a good answer from the state. "" During a Monday press briefing, Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned regions where hospital capacity becomes an issue could face new restrictions. Cuomo also said people have it in their power to avoid that. ""You see the positivity rate go up. You see the hospitalization rate go up. You see the hospital capacity go down. That is going to lead you to a closedown,"" Cuomo said. ""There is no alternative. So, people are in control of their own destiny, you know? This is not government. This is social behavior. "" Smith noted the county's three hospitals in Corning, Bath and Hornell are not yet overflowing with COVID 19 cases and are below the 85% capacity threshold set by the state to trigger restrictions. Steuben County health officials also report seven individuals ranging in age from 64 to 89 who had previously tested positive for COVID 19 have died since Friday. There are now 146 deaths attributed to the virus in Steuben County. Among the deaths were two women who resided at Bath area nursing homes. Others lived in the towns of Caton, Prattsburgh, Cameron, Wayland and Greenwood. ""Our community just lost seven friends, neighbors and family members, Smith said. The numbers will continue to tragically rise if we all don t do our part to slow the spread of the virus. COVID 19 cases have been surging across the Southern Tier and other parts of New York state since early September, but Steuben County's latest spike is greater than neighboring counties. Chemung County has more than 4,700 total cases including 88 new cases Tuesday but only 200 active cases and 66 deaths, with a 7 day positivity rate of 7.9%. Schuyler County reports a total of 579 cases and 61 active cases, with 19 coronavirus related deaths. The positivity rate is 7.4%, according to the state database.

Purcelville,"28 Must-Try DC Restaurant Dishes Now Available for Pickup and Delivery Original May 2020 post updated There was a time you d have to wait in line or make a hard won reservation to get a taste of sensational restaurant dishes like the Red Hen s sausage rigatoni, the duck at Peking Gourmet Inn, or Kinship s roast chicken. Times have obviously changed, and one small silver lining: now you can get these classics old and new delivered to your door or for pickup. 2 Amys deviled eggs with green sauce 3715 Macomb St. , NW Sure, 2 Amys is one of DC s most popular pizzerias for a reason (the Neapolitan pizzas). But! We ve always loved the sophisticated, unfussy small plates heavy on anchovies, cured meats, and seasonal gems as much as the Neapolitan pies. These jammy eggs with herbaceous salsa verde always steal the show. Order online for pickup. A J dim sum 1319 Rockville Pike, Rockville 4316 Markham St. , Annandale We ve spent many a weekend waiting for a coveted table outside these tiny, family run Chinese spots (also: seeking out an ATM for the cash only rule). These days you can get everything to go we love the scallion pancakes, juicy dumplings, beef wraps, spicy noodle soups, and cucumber salad and pay through Venmo. Call or order online. Bad Saint 3226 11th St. , NW Who would have thought this tiny, ultra popular Filipino restaurant would package their line standing dishes to go? The takeout menu (served Thursday through Saturday) changes so often it s hard to pinpoint one item, but the punchy, creative flavors we ve come to expect are all there. Past dishes include crab fat noodles, spring rolls, and pork belly. There s also an online marketplace with homemade chili sauces, noodles, CSA boxes, and more. Order online. Beteseb vegetable platter and rib eye tibs 8201 Georgia Ave. , Silver Spring Ethiopian food travels beautifully, and out of all the options, we re partial to this family run restaurant in Silver Spring. Go for rib eye tibs saut ed with onion and green pepper and the heaping vegetarian platter. For the brave: the kitfo (tartare like minced raw beef) is superb. Call for pickup. Cane tiffin boxes 403 H St. , NE We loved crowding around the tables at chef Peter Prime s small H Street dining room pre Covid. The menu hasn t changed much for takeout a good thing and the tiffin boxes are a great way to go for both sampling and travel (curries generally carry well). Pick between omnivore or vegetarian, both loaded with curries, chutneys, and homemade bread. Order online for pickup. Columbia Room cocktails 124 Blagden Alley, NW Derek Brown s classy cocktail destination has been packaging seasonal drinks to go since the stat of the pandemic (and unlike some of the straightforward cocktails on the takeout market, good luck creating these at home). For January, Brown also has non alcoholic creations. If you re hungry, check out Your Only Friend sandwich pop up. Order online for pickup and delivery. Compass Rose khachupuri 1346 T St. , NW Rose Previte s 14th Street dining room certainly didn t invent the decadent Georgian cheese bread, but it can claim responsibility for popularizing it to Jumbo Slice level proportions in the minds of hungry Washingtonians. Instead of a server mixing molten cheese, egg, and butter inside the canoe shaped bread table side, the takeout version comes with instructions for doing it at home. Order online for takeout. The Dabney catfish sliders 122 Blagden Alley NW You ll have to order a three course menu ( 45) to get chef Jeremiah Langhorne s previously off menu crispy catfish sandwich but the addictive bite is worth it. Other seasonal dishes like barbecue chicken don t sound shabby, either. Order online for takeout and delivery. Daikaya ramen 705 Sixth St. , NW Daikaya s siblings all jumped onto the takeout wagon pre pandemic, including chicken centric Bantam King and Navy Yard s Hatoba. But these days you can get the original Daikaya ramen to go, plus tons of fun extras from their online marketplace. Our move: the muggi miso ramen or the vegetarian version with an optional porky spice bomb. Order online for pickup and delivery. Fiola Mare lobster ravioli 3100 K St. , NW It s always a special (re: very expensive) splurge to dine at Fabio Trabbochi s Georgetown restaurant. Takeout and delivery are no different. Does 60 ravioli to go seem insanely indulgent? Yes. But these ravioli come stuffed with lobster, half a tail, and a velvety lobster sauce. And they cost a fraction of that vacation you re not taking. Order online for pickup and delivery. Hank s Oyster Bar lobster roll Locations in Dupont Circle, the Wharf, Capitol Hill Over a decade later, our favorite item on chef Jamie Leeds menu is the lobster roll packed with sweet meat is on the menu of classics. For a side, go for the ultra creamy mac n cheese or lobster bisque. Available for pickup or delivery. Jaleo gambas al ajillo Locations in Penn Quarter, Bethesda, and Crystal City This simple yet delicious dish of garlicky shrimp debuted with Jose Andres first Jaleo in Penn Quarter 27 years ago and there s a reason its been on the menu of every Jaleo since. Classic sangria or an excellent gin and tonic are on the menu too. Order online for pickup and delivery. Kinship roast chicken 1015 Seventh St. , NW Chef Eric Ziebold s fancy roast chicken strutted onto the scene when the luxe poultry trend was just beginning and it s still one of the best.

Komi pita bread 1509 17th St. , NW Chef Johnny Monis closed his fine dining destination at the start of the pandemic and reopened as Happy Gyro, a veggie centric ode his family s Greek diner. The menu of pizzas and sandwiches looks a lot different, but the homemade, ethereal pita breads that accompanied every Komi feast can be ordered as gyro sandwiches (we love the vegetarian and lamb) or solo to start the meal (go ahead and splurge on the barrel aged feta with it). Another thing we re psyched to see on the go: sommelier Kyle Wilson s carefully curated wines, beers, and ciders. Order online for pickup. Maketto fried chicken 1351 H St. , NE Chef Erik Bruner Yang isn t a newcomer to the takeout platform and that s a good thing for consistency s sake. His mouth tingling, generous plate of fried chicken, spiced with Szechuan peppercorns and drizzled in five spice caramel, is as good as ever. Available for pickup or delivery. Le Diplomate cheeseburger Am ricain 1601 14th St. , NW Le Dip s burger is basically a cheffy riff on le Big Mac: two diner style, dry aged patties, creamy special sauce, pickles, and onions on a homemade brioche bun. It ll cost you 20 these days (with ultra crispy fries) but it s a meal in itself. Unless, like us, you re tempted by the brasserie s sleeper hit: the buttery shrimp salad. Available for takeout or delivery on multiple platforms. Little Serow whiskey pork ribs 1511 17th St. , NW In the old days, you d have to wait in line and then sweat through a fiery, multi course meal to reach Serow s pork y pinnacle: charred, whiskey marinated ribs. Now you can get them a la carte (plus rice and veggies) as part of the takeout menu, or as part of a multi course set dinner to g0. Order online for takeout. Market Lunch crabcake breakfast 225 Seventh St. , SE There s something ultra satisfying about indulging in crabcakes for breakfast. This 40 plus year old Eastern Market dining counter griddles the meaty cakes alongside creamy grits and scrambled eggs. You can get them at lunch, or packaged and ready to make at home. These days, the operation takes credit cards. Call for curbside pickup. Oohhs Aahhs shrimp n grits 1005 U St. , NW 5933 Georgia Ave. , NW If you re seeking comfort to go, it s hard to go wrong at the soul food restaurant fried chicken or fish, mac n cheese, turkey wings we could go on. But it s hard to beat a bowl of the shrimp and creamy homemade grits, which never skimps on the seafood. Ten shrimp can come grilled, fried, or best yet, blackened with Cajun spice. Order online for pickup. Padaek/Thip Khao crispy coconut rice salad 6395 Seven Corners Center, Falls Church 3462 14th St. , NW Chef Seng Luangrath and Bobby Pradacith s Lao restaurants in DC and Falls Church are both open for takeout. It s hard to miss on either menu, but the crunchy rice salad strewn with herbs, morsels of sausage and peanuts, and lettuce leaves for wrapping is a must (it can also be made veggie). Available for carryout from Padaek order online for Thip Khao. Peking Gourmet Inn Peking duck 6029 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church The Peking duck at Eddie Tsui s Falls Church mainstay became so popular in the 80s that the family opened their own farm in Purcelville, Virginia to grow thousands of pounds of spring onions to accompany the crackling skinned bird and homemade pancakes. You can get a whole duck ( 50) to go, and don t forget an order of shrimp with garlic shoots. Available for takeout and free delivery within a limited radius. Pho 75 1 pho 1721 Wilson Blvd, Arlington 771 Hungerford Dr, Rockville These soup parlors were ladeling no frills, soul warming bowls of Vietnamese pho long before the dish became trendy. You won t find large, varied menus just the soup, with extras like Vietnamese ice coffee. We re fans of the 1, floating with eye round steak, flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe plus heaps of herbs. Call for pickup cash only. The Prime Rib prime rib 2020 K St. , NW With a dress code policy and tagline like the civilized steakhouse, we were surprised to see this K Street stalwart offer takeout. But sure enough, you can get a juicy, 24 ounce hunk of prime meat on the fly, rounded out with lobster bisque or a wedge salad. Whether you don the proper jacket at home is up to you. Order here for pickup and delivery. Rappahannock Oyster Bar oysters on the half shell 1150 Maine Ave. , SW We ve spent many a happy afternoon over a chilled platter of briny Olde Salt and creamy Rochambeau oysters (meaty clams, too). The good news: that doesn t have to change thanks to the Wharf location s to go offerings, which even include chilled wines. Bivalves can be ordered shucked and ready, or whole to pop open at home. We re also fans of the crabcake, chowder, and peel and eat shrimp. Order online for pickup. Rasika palaak chaat 633 D St. , NW 1190 New Hampshire Ave. , NW Indian food is one of those cuisines that travels reliably well, and while chef Vikram Sunderam s crispy spinach may not hold up as well as a curry, we ve found it still fares well (credit the cooling yogurt, dates, and chutney each packaged separately). You can also buy homemade Rasika simmer sauces for cooking at home. Available for pickup or delivery. Red Hen rigatoni with sausage ragu 1822 First St. , NW This comforting bowl of pasta with a saucy Sunday style gravy packed with homemade fennel sausage and capped with parm has been on chef Michael Friedman s menu since day one. There s a reason it s never left. Order online for pickup or delivery. Rose s Luxury Pork and lychee salad 717 Eighth St. , SE Chef Aaron Silverman s unexpectedly addictive salad of sweet lychees, chilies, onion, pork, and coconut milk is a dish that helped land Rose s Luxury on the national map. You can now get it along with buzzed about entrees like grilled pork ribs as part of a three course takeout spread ( 45 per person). Order online for pickup. Sushi Taro chirashi 1503 17th St. , NW The Michelin starred Dupont restaurant never offered much takeout over its decades in business until the pandemic. Now it s all in, offering everything from its excellent lunchtime bentos (now available at dinner) to full at home omakase meals. We love the artful chirashi bowls and their pretty takeout packaging for sampling ultra fresh sashimi over a bed of perfectly seasoned rice. Order online for pickup.

Aggieville,"City working on updated bike, pedestrian system plan Manhattan planners are envisioning a future with improved bicycle and pedestrian routes, including additional bikeways and protected cycletracks alongside city streets. City commissioners Tuesday discussed an update to the Bicycle and Pedestrian Systems Plan, which lays out potential future projects to improve biking and walking around Manhattan. The previous plan was adopted in 1998. City administration created the plan, with input from Kansas State University, USD 383, RCPD, the Chamber and area developers. Feedback was also sought from stakeholders such as Downtown Manhattan, Inc. and the Aggieville Business Association as well as the Rotary Club. Manhattan paid 40,000 to formulate the plan, leveraging a nearly 150,000 KDOT grant to assist as well. Funds for various projects will be sourced from the 2017 voter approved Parks and Recreation sales tax, the City University fund and an assortment of federal and state grants. In recent years, Manhattan has been able to leverage more than a million dollars from 270,000 of city investment for trail projects. The plan lists out a number of future projects to be tackled as funds permit over the next 10 to 20 years. Those include installing wayfinding signage on trails and expanding bicycle parking possibilities, finishing the final 6 miles of the Linear Trail loop, creating divided bicycle lanes and two way cycle tracks and filling in gaps in the sidewalk system. A full list can be found here. Projects will be prioritized using a matrix that accounts for equity, safety, connectivity, demand, need and financial feasibility. Based on these factors, projects are divided into four categories of prioritization: Do Now, Do If, Do When and Long Term. Commissioner Linda Morse suggested that priority be given to creating and improving trails in areas without connectivity to the trail system before improving walkways in already served neighborhoods. It s a benefit for the people in our community, says Morse. And some of the areas have never had the opportunity to have a bicycle and pedestrian path. Mayor Pro Tempore Wynn Butler says he s not a fan of separated bike boulevards, though questioned whether the city could make some streets one way in order to accommodate more bike lanes. He says there were multiple one way streets around town when he first arrived in the community in the 80s. If we re truly concerned about safety and we want people to use bike lanes and trails , I d like to have some people just take a look at that and see if it makes any sense. Another specific project discussed Tuesday is a plan to pave and add lighting along the newly created Old Blue River Trail that connects Northview to Downtown and the Linear Trail system. Public Works Director Rob Ott says this project is unique and that they don t plan to light every trail. Lighting will be handled by Evergy, for which the city will pay a small fee of about 12 per light. Mayor Usha Reddi says she is glad that is a part of the discussion. It s a big safety issue, says Reddi. Hopefully it s not going to be so bright that it impedes on some of the neighborhoods and their windows and their houses, but it s enough that you feel safe and you re not riding your bike or walking in the dark. The decision to pave the trail, administration says, is to increase its usability, especially after heavy rain when the walkway is turned to mud. City administration also says they ve heard comments on how dark the pathway is, and as there aren t neighboring homes they are in favor of adding lighting. Currently, City administration is anticipating that project to cost 250,000, but hope to significantly reduce the impact on the city by drawing in grant money. RCPD Update Riley County Police are testing new uniforms with an option available for officers to wear a ballistic vest, which the department s director says is not just an aesthetic choice. Director Dennis Butler provided an update to the Manhattan City Commission Tuesday and says the vests can help better distribute the weight of necessary gear and help reduce hip pain and discomfort caused by a heavy belt. He told commissioners a story of an officer he worked with in the past who was too small to fit all required gear on her belt. We evaluated it there and decided to go ahead and authorize our officers there to wear them, mainly for practical reasons, says Butler. Flexibility, not because it looked cool. Butler says he never was a big fan of the look of such vests, and expressed a desire to avoid looking too militaristic. He says whatever route they choose to go uniform wise, he wants any ballistic vests to blend well with the standard uniform. Now it s hard, in some ways, to get away from that perception from some people, Butler says. But that is part of my evaluation if they do recommend an outer vest as part of the uniform. RCPD is currently field testing a different shade of blue alongside a navy and a grey uniform over a 90 day period. The change in uniform comes after repeated complaints that the outfit is uncomfortable in certain scenarios and as many police departments move away from the French Blue color traditionally donned by Riley County officers. Butler also says that due to that decreased demand, acquiring uniforms in that color will be increasingly difficult as manufacturers remove it from production. Additionally, Butler told commissioners that RCPD has begun the first of a million dollars worth of upgrades as Riley County plans its roll out of a new emergency services radio system. Butler says that price tag is necessary to re outfit all officers and vehicles with necessary radios, microphones and holders to be able to utilize the new system. Butler says there are hopes the system will go live this summer. Live doesn t mean we ll be switched over and operating on it, he says. Live means then they ll start testing the system to make sure everything is operational. Butler also gave an update on the new RCPD firing range, saying work continues steadily. They are working with the county and vendor to get the facility in order as the lease on their current range ends at the end of June. We re hoping to at least have the basic, qualifactioned, firing line in place sometime before the end of the summer. If work takes longer than anticipated, Butler says they have contingency plans in place as well to ensure they aren t without a training facility. "
Aggieville,"City commission selects Wynn Butler as new mayor; discusses 17th St. name change New Manhattan mayor City commissioner Wynn Butler has officially been named Manhattan s mayor for 2021. The change was made Tuesday as part of an annual reorganization which involves a rotation among the city commission s five members. Butler says he wants the commission to focus on taxes, infrastructure and responsible growth during his term. I don t want to see property taxes go up, Butler said. I don t want to see sales taxes go up either. We ve got to continue with infrastructure. Of course the airport we ve got a runway issue. We ve got a maintenance shop we need to finish. We ve got a levee we need to fix. We need to do that staying within our budget. Former mayor and now commissioner Usha Reddi closed out her term by highlighting accomplishments from 2020, such as beginning construction on the Aggieville parking garage and the Douglass Rec Center, and reflecting on the pandemic. This impacted every governing agency, staff member, business, public education and family, Reddi said. We had to make tough decisions regarding our budget and even tougher decisions regarding public health. I am proud of our community. These are challenging times and the Manhattan family stayed strong and continued to work together. In addition to Butler becoming mayor, commissioner Linda Morse was named mayor pro tem. Potential name change for 17th St. The name of 17th St. may officially change to Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. in the near future. With the submission of a request by MLK Memorial Committee, the city commission will soon consider an ordinance to officially enact the change. Kevin Bryant, MLK Memorial Committee co chair, explained to the commission during their meeting Tuesday why 17th St. was chosen. 17th Street symbolism is the bridge, Bryant said. In the past, Yuma Street east and west acted as a chasm to people of various backgrounds. Renaming a north and south street in honor of Dr. King would act as a bridge to the local community instead of emphasizing historic divisions. He says the street also symbolically connects many important parts of the area. The connection of 17th Street symbolically connects our military, our historical local business sector on Poyntz (Avenue) and the commitment to education at Kansas State University, Bryant said. Butler says that while he was concerned area residents would not want to change their addresses, he is relieved to hear that a survey carried out by the MLK Memorial Committee shows a majority of residents living on 17th St. support the change. That would have been my only concern if we had a large amount of residents or property owners that do not wish to go through the logistics of changing that, then I would begin not to support it, Butler said. But otherwise, I don t have a problem. While other commissioners, such as Mark Hatesohl, shared the same concern, support for the change was largely unanimous. Through a letter of support, K State also endorsed the change. Commissioner Aaron Estabrook says the project presents an opportunity to do the right thing. When I left to come to this meeting, my 10 year old daughter stopped me and said, hey, don t forget the time is always right to do what is right,' Estabrook said. That s a Dr. King quote. I think it s important to have that sign, that naming, so we can think about these things in our community. The commission previously discussed the name change in 2006, but decided instead to memorialize the street in MLK s honor. This was done so that residents would not have to officially change their addresses. 17th St. runs from Fort Riley Blvd. , through parts of Manhattan and the K State campus and ends at Claflin Rd. City officials say the process of getting the ordinance ready, informing residents of the upcoming change, obtaining materials and putting together an installation plan could take 60 to 90 days.

Schuyerville,"NY Congressman calls for Trump impeachment, accuses president of inciting violence Members of Congress from New York state say they re safe amid chaos in Washington, D. C. , after a large number of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to protest the election results. The Democrat Chronicle reports Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and 26 members of the House of Representatives, all from New York, were on hand for a joint session of Congress to affirm the Electoral College votes with Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. After some Republicans objected to the certification of the votes, lawmakers from the House and Senate separated for two hours of debate. At the same time, hundreds of protesters carrying Make America Great Again flags and wearing pro Trump clothing clashed with police, eventually making their way inside the Capitol building and onto the Senate floor. Shortly afterwards, lawmakers from New York let constituents and family members know they were safe. Rep. John Katko, R Camillus, said he was safe inside a locked office and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R Schuyerville, said she and her staff were safe in an undisclosed location. This is pure insanity, Katko told syracuse. com. We ve got a real problem on our hands. I m shocked we weren t better prepared from a security standpoint. It s absolutely stunning incompetence. Americans have a Constitutional right to protest freedom of speech, but violence in any form is absolutely unacceptable anti American, added Stefanik, who also planned to object to Biden electors Wednesday. At least one Congress member, Rep. Mondaire Jones, D South Nyack, Rockland County, went a step further and called for impeaching Trump. Donald Trump has incited violence against the legislative branch of the United States Government and must be impeached again, Jones wrote on Twitter. Donald Trump has incited violence against the legislative branch of the United States Government and must be impeached again. Rep. Mondaire Jones ( RepJones) January 6, 2021 Rep.

It s a matter of preserving our Republic and we need to fulfill our oath. I am drawing up Articles of Impeachment. Donald J.

He was previously impeached about a year ago, but was not removed from office. Trump was accused of riling up his supporters earlier Wednesday with a speech near the White House that included baseless claims of election fraud. We will not let them silence your voices, Trump told the crowd. Nearly an hour after the U. S. Capitol Building was breached, Trump used Twitter to encourage protesters to remain peaceful. I am asking for everyone at the U. S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law Order respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you! Trump tweeted.

Kreischerville,"The Haunted Fleischer Mansion Murder House When looking for an incredibly haunted place, some can have the most promising of origins, and among these are those that are inherently imbued with dark histories. Some of the most haunted places out there are those that are referred to as murder houses, where gruesome crimes and killings have been carried out. Besides the stigma attached to such properties, there is the inevitable impression that they have somehow been stained by the tragedy, permeated with a certain ominous energy that invariably leads to ghost stories. One such murder house can be found in New York City, and it ticks all the boxes of a spooky place, sinister past, death, misfortune, and plenty of paranormal activity to go around. In 1836, a successful German born brickmaker by the name of Balthasar Kreischer made his way to the shores of the United States with his wife and children, arriving in New York City with impeccable timing. A great fire had recently raged through the city, gutting large swaths of it, so Kreischer set up a brickwork factory for manufacturing what were called fire bricks, used in the construction of more fire resistant structures. Considering the tragedy that had ravaged the city, the massive rebuilding going on, and the demand for more fireproof materials, Kreischer made a killing, with a ripple effect from his business creating an economic boom that caused the area to be reverently called Kreischerville, which would later be changed to Charleston. Things were not all rosy for Kreischer. He lost a son, Henry, at the age of 6, his wife Caroline died in 1853 in childbirth giving birth to their seventh child Edward, and in 1877 his second wife, Mathilda, also died, only made worse when his factory burned down to the ground, although he managed to rebuild. It is perhaps from here that the legacy of this mansion would grow to include dark fates, death, murder, and misfortune that would contribute to it becoming one of the most haunted places in New York. Kresicher would retire and hand his business over to his sons, Charles and Edward, and build two mansions for them at Charleston, Staten Island, in 1885. At the time the business was booming again, and things had never been better, however, this seems to be where things started to derail into darkness and tragedy. Just a year after the houses were complete, Kreischer suddenly died in 1886, leaving the business solely to his sons. Shortly after that, the factory was razed yet again by a fire, ironic for a fire brick making facility, and although the sons tried to rebuild, this was the beginning of a downward spiral to doom. They were never able to get the business back to where it had been, their fortunes diminished, and in 1894 Edward took his own life with a gunshot to the head. In later years, Charles mansion would burn to the ground during the Great Depression in the 1930s, leaving just one left. Abandoned and tainted, with the suicide that had taken place on its grounds hanging over it like a cloud, it went through a quick procession of owners and became a magnet for all sorts of spooky stories. There were lots of rumors, such as that a chef had been murdered in the kitchen and that the Kreischers had often locked their many children in closets as punishment, with at least one said to have died in that state. Paranormal tales were numerous, such as shadowy figures standing at the windows, orbs of light moving about within, the sound of wailing, and even the ghost of Edward ambling about, such reports were common. One of the only things keeping the decrepit building from being condemned was it being made into a landmark in 1968, after which it would be added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was at one time in the 90s a restaurant said to be frequented by the mob, but this operation did not last long. In 2000, the property was purchased by a man named Isaac Yomtovian, who renovated it and restored it to somewhat of a shadow of its former glory to be resold, but it mostly was just inhabited by a caretaker by the name of Joseph Young, also known by the nickname Joe Black. Little did Yomtovian know that Young was a dishonorably discharged ex soldier who was heavily connected to the mafia, which would lead to another dark and sinister splotch on a place that was already well known for being haunted and possibly cursed. In 2005, a mafia associate the name of Robert McKelvey apparently owed money to Bonnano mafia crime family patriarch, Gino Galestro, and was lured to the Kreischer mansion by Young, after which the caretaker strangled and stabbed him, drowning him in a nearby pond for good measure. It would come to light that Young had been doing a bit of side work as a mob hitman for the Bonanno family, and that several associates had helped him to hack apart the body into pieces to be disposed of in the mansion s basement furnace. Young would be found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in 2008, and in the meantime the ghost of McKelvey has been said to join the roster of spooks said to haunt these halls, and what a roster it is. Among the ghosts said to dwell at the mansion are that of Edward Freischer, his wife Frieda, the German chef who was rumored to have died there, that of a young boy whose identity is unknown but who is thought to have been one of the Freischer children, and other less definable shadow figures. Common paranormal activity here other than the sightings of these apparitions include slamming doors, rooms locked from the inside only to be unlocked later, flickering lights, and all manner of anomalous noises such as disembodied footsteps, whispers, and screaming, and videotapes made by paranormal investigators have been mysteriously erased. The house has become the site of an annual Halloween haunted house and has appeared on the TV dramas Boardwalk Empire and Gotham, with the crew and actors reporting various strange phenomena such as moving objects, and freak equipment malfunctions, and the apparition of a little girl, as well as the paranormal investigative shows Paranormal Lockdown and Ghost Hunters. It has gone on to become a very well known locale in New York, and a prominent murder house that has managed to have paranormal phenomena stick to it. What is going on and why do these forces swirl around it? We may never know for sure, but considering the death, tragedy and strife that permeates these walls, it is perhaps not that hard to see why it might be considered to be haunted. "
Wrigleyville,"Illinois dispensaries open for recreational sales: Leafly’s live coverage IndustryPolitics Illinois dispensaries open for recreational sales: Leafly s live coverage Leafly Staff January 1, 2020 Edie Moore (right), executive director of Chicago NORML makes the first purchase on the first day of recreational cannabis sales in Illinois at Mission dispensary in Chicago, Illinois, Jan. 1, 2020. (Taylor Glascock/for Leafly) Legalization comes to the Land of Lincoln on New Year s Day, and Leafly is on the ground with coverage from cannabis dispensaries across Illinois. Check back throughout the day as we continue to bring you highlights from around the state. Illinois legalization launch clears liftoff, heads to orbit 2:00 p. m. , Chicago They came before dawn. Their extremities went numb. Yet they smiled and cheered, and then they got high. Launch day for Illinois legalization is well underway this afternoon, with tens of thousands of people likely to cycle through several dozen stores across the state. Meanwhile, on TV, the world watched and rooted them on. Waits ran four plus hours at the MOCA dispensary near Logan Square in Chicago at midday, and recreational supplies of flowers were already running low, staffers told the crowd. Still, none gave up their place in line. Rather, the sunny 40 degree weather and all the news reports only served to grow the throngs such was the draw of hype and history across the Land of Lincoln today. The days and weeks to come promise more lines, along with extensive recreational product shortages but those are mere growing pains. Every attendee that Leafly talked to today agreed that what began before dawn in Illinois promises to reverberate across the Midwest, South, and East of the US fomenting even bigger changes. I love this shit so much, said one man in a three hour line at Dispensary 33. This is great. Two latecomers, Patrick a 47 year old project manager and his partner Yolanda in her 40s and in finance noted the launch day was like the Popeye s Chicken sandwich rollout of 2019. Of course there is scarcity. And almost everyone could agree with Patrick, who said, I m kind of mad I didn t get up earlier. Thanks for reading along with Leafly s liveblog of the day s events. Keep reading below for all the quotes, photos, and color of the day. And stay tuned to Leafly for where legalization goes from here. David Downs 3 hour wait for legal herb? We don t mind 12:39 p. m. , Chicago Diontae, 35, and Monika 32, are both from the South Side of Chicago. Both saw the morning news coverage of opening day sales at Illinois cannabis stores, jumped in their car together, and drove down to Sunnyside near Wrigleyville to get into the back of what is now a three hour line to buy legal cannabis. It s also 21 degrees out in the sun. They didn t show the line on the news, said Diontae. This is crazy all these people openly standing in line to buy drugs, he said. We don t do lines. But this is one line we don t mind waiting in. It s so mind blowing, he said. We re from the South Side, so we re impacted by the war on drugs. Diontae had a cannabis conviction that he got expunged on his own. He expects to spend 120 to 140 on cannabis flower. We ll try edibles later. On their last trip to Las Vegas, the duo failed to make it to a legal store and promised themselves they d return to hit one up. Now they don t have to schlep to Vegas. You don t have to go to Cali or Michigan. David Downs I m thrilled to have these dispensaries 12:33 p. m. , Chicago Dispensary 33 in Chicago hosted a 10 a. m. press conference featuring several city and officials, including the Chicago Deputy Mayor Samir Mayekar, several alderman, and a number of state representatives. Dispensary 33 had served 350 people in just a few hours, with hundreds more still waiting to be served. Legalization bill sponsor State Rep. Kelly Cassidy stopped by the store and said this is surreal, referring to the hundreds waiting patiently down the block. 'This is the beginning of the end of the war on drugs. ' Cassidy said she looks forward to implementing equity licensing and automatic expungements. This isn t the finish line. This is the beginning of the end of the war on drugs. While many Illinois cities have rejected legal sales, some Chicago wards are welcoming them. Fortieth ward Alderman Andre Vasquez said friends have been arrested and some have died in the war on cannabis. It really does warm my heart on this very cold day, he said. Yeah, i m just geeked. Forty seventh ward Alderman Matt Martin celebrated Dispensary 33 s local ownership. We need to live our values, he said. This proves change is possible. I m thrilled to have these dispensaries in my ward. David Downs Licenses kill the illegal market but if you don t give out the licenses, people can t buy legally and the illegal market thrives. We ve seen this in many states. California s transition from illegal to legal is moving at a glacial pace because too many local towns and counties prohibit legal stores. Illinois is just waking up to the issue. I should ve figured the state of Illinois would fuck this up. Weed is recreationally legal today, but all the dispensaries around me haven t been approved by the state to sell recreationally. Dude wtf JBPritzker Pay College Athletes ( GeniusWithNoJob) January 1, 2020 Lines still forming at stores around Chicagoland 11:06 a. m. , Chicago As the morning approaches the noon hour, more New Year revelers are waking up and taking their place at the end of the still growing lines at legal cannabis stores around Illinois. Leafly s David Downs shot this video at Dispensary 33 on North Clark Street a few minutes ago: Donuts, hot dogs, and propane heaters in Homewood 10:41 a. m. , Homewood Windy City Cannabis in Homewood, IL, which is just ten miles from the Indiana state line, did it right for their customers: Outside heaters, donuts, and hot dogs for those in line. Richard, who was standing right under one of the heaters, was hoping to obtain some Blue Gelato and Durban Poison. A sativa fan, he was fifth in line and had been there since 8 a. m. Doors were scheduled to open at 11 a. m. He didn t have a medical cannabis card, Richard said. He came here from Oak Lawn because that city passed an ordinance banning adult use cannabis stores. That was a mistake, he said. I think they ll realize that soon. Another gentleman standing next to Richard well disguised, I might add, with sunglasses and enough bundling to never be recognized as well as keep the cold out did not wish to give his name, and he said he almost went to Joliet this morning because there were two open shops there, which could mean shorter lines. But I think I came to the right place. Brandon Weber Lt. Gov. Stratton marks history: A model for the entire country 10:12 a. m. , Chicago Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton was on hand Wednesday morning to buy cannabis at Sunnyside in Chicago s Lakeview neighborhood. We believe the social equity aspects of this legislation should be a model for the entire country, she said outside the store. Yesterday, Governor Pritzker pardoned 11,017 low level cannabis arrests and convictions. That s just the beginning. We have hundreds of thousands more who will be eligible for having their records expunged. That s a big deal. Better than waiting for the new iPhone Weed is now legal in Illinois. It feels like 15f outside. 500 people deep at 9am. Worse than a damn console release. Wow. pic. twitter. com/nuNnU1hZ06 Jesse ( ItsGime) January 1, 2020 The stigma is real for many Illinois consumers 10:07 a. m. , Chicago They pulled hoodies down over their faces and turned away from the news cameras. They declined to give their name, or used a fake. And they are many. Even though cannabis is now legal in Illinois, the stigma remains. You can lose your job, education, housing, kids, pain medication, or more over cannabis. Locals are savvy the consequences of being outed as a cannabis consumer. Thirty year old Noire declined to give her real name and confirmed, the stigma is real. All of these people are in jail on marijuana charges, she added. Illinois State Police made more than 34,000 cannabis arrests in 2016. Noire lined up around dawn to get edibles and be a part of the big day. It s historic. We are one of the only liberal states in the midwest. Others in line noted the diverse ages and ethnicities of the crowd. So this is who smokes weed, said one customer. People from all walks of life. David Downs It feels good to be a part of history 9:55 a. m. , Chicago Mohammed, 26, and Amir, 24, both of Chicago spent 90 each on Starkiller and Durban Poison. It feels good to be a part of history, said Mohammed. It ll show people cannabis use is no big deal. Mohammend hopes to visit every open cannabis store and catch em all like Pokemon. And both men look forward to prices coming down. We re not a big fan of the prices. As we were talking, a passerby eyed the line and said, My guy is faster than this. David Downs Romeoville represents in the 23 degree cold 9:50 a. m. , Romeoville At VeriLife s store here in Romeoville, Dylan arrived from his home in Naperville about 3:30 a. m. , and found himself first in line. Dylan sported a Chicago Blackhawks cap and as much warm weather gear as he could find. The only thing he was missing? Some good boots. His fiancee and he tag teamed to keep their spot in line, each taking time to warm up in their nearby vehicle especially his feet. As we were talking, a young man strolled past to find the end of the line, blocks away. He was dressed in sandals and warm socks. When asked what he wanted to find inside the store at the 9:00 am start time, Dylan said, I want a cartridge, and possibly a gram. As I moved down the line, somebody shouted, Hey, Dylan REPRESENT! Another waiting customer, Rich, wasn t even sure what he wanted to find. I ve been here since seven o clock, he said. I m just looking for something to help me sleep, and something to make me giggle. He didn t seem too upset about being in line. January first, everybody else is home with a hangover. Near the end of the line which was still adding people by the minute Gina and Lauren were pretty sure they wanted to get some high quality flower. They didn t seem to mind the line, or the 23 degree cold. It s not windy. It s really not that bad out. The sun came out, so that helps. Pro tip: An Illinois patrol car passed me by as I drove to a parking spot in this heavily industrial area, blocks past the end of the line. He flagged me. Just so you know, we re not patrolling the private parking lots. I didn t say that officially he added with a smile. Brandon Weber Sorry, military spouses must step off base to puff 9:30 a. m. , Chicago Scott Air Force Base News brings us information about cannabis use for those connected to the military: Marijuana may be legal in Illinois, but what about Scott Air Force Base? Though affiliated with military, be it active duty, Reserves, or National Guard, military spouses are still treated as civilians in the eyes of the law and the military. So, if something is legal in your state, then military spouses are treated the same as any other civilian. But that does not include cannabis use on government property as these are still federally controlled substances. Government property includes on base or in any military housing, on base or off. Also, be aware that even if you can use cannabis, your service member cannot. If you leave cannabis in a vehicle that your service member drives onto base, he or she has technically introduced an illegal substance onto a military installation. The use or possession of an illegal substance could end a service member s career. David Downs Illinois State Police: Use common sense, don t smoke and drive 9:15 a. m. , Chicago Illinois State Police chief Brandon Kelly discussed fears of DUI increases after legalization in a radio interview. There s differing opinions about what the data say, he said. For example, lots of folks look to Colorado as the test subject for this policy. Just for the record, in Colorado, traffic fatalities fell in 2019 to 533, down 55 from the prior year off a 2002 peak of 677. Colorado s also maybe not the best barometer, though they have very loose traffic safety laws you can t be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt. In the end it comes down to common sense, said Kelly. Not a lot will change on Jan.1 in terms of enforcement you can t be driving aorund in your vehicle high on cannabis, that s not safe, just as it s not safe to drive under the influence of alcohol, or heroin, or fentanyl. In Washington, the data continues to implicate alcohol as the problem driver in that legalization state. Here s Washington s snapshot of fatal accidents. It s flat. Still, two thirds of Illinois drivers in a AAA survey said they were very concerned about cannabis on the roadways. David Downs New day dawns at O Hare Airport as weed walks free 9:08 a. m. , Chicago Don t fly with cannabis. You don t have the nerve to be a smuggler like Han Solo. But if you accidentally do fly with cannabis out of Illinois, take heart. State police have to enforce state law. Personal amounts of cannabis cannot be seized. According to NBC: If it s not a violation, we would offer them proper disposal, if they wish, or they could continue on with their travels, Mullane said, adding that CPD cannot require someone to dispose of it if it is legal. We would explain to them that under federal law, it is still a violation and that based on where they are going to it may be a violation there, he added. No different if they are flying into Chicago with product. If they are legal, they are legal. But still, don t do it. The mayor s office also warned that federal law prohibits cannabis possession in any amount, which could affect travelers. Transportation of any amount of cannabis remains illegal across state lines, and possession of cannabis may be illegal in the state or country to which you are traveling, said a statement from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot s office. David Downs South Side Chicago cannabis sales start at Mission Illinois 8:31 a. m. , Chicago Edie Moore, executive director of Chicago NORML and a key champion of legalization, became the first person to buy legal cannabis in Chicago s famous South Side at 6 a. m. Wednesday. Moore was the guest of honor at Mission Illinois, the only South Side dispensary approved for adult use sales on launch day. It feels amazing to be the first purchaser, Moore told Leafly. It s a historic moment for South Side residents, she said. It means they have a place to actually come Mission is a really great facility and it s clean and it s friendly and they don t have to travel all the way to the north side that s great. Moore spent 70 on an eighth ounce of White Harmony. Lines are long and getting longer at Mission Illinois, as more folks see the news on morning TV and rush down. Additionally, Moore reported that the state purchase system went down briefly, creating additional delays. David Downs Kris Krane, founder of Mission Illinois and an industry veteran, said lines were running about three hours and more people were showing up to the only dispensary open on the South Side. It s an honor to represent legalization on the South Side, Krane said. This community has been hit hardest by cannabis prohibition, so it is heartwarming to be able to provide a professional environment where residents can legally purchase cannabis without fear of arrest or stigma of being branded a criminal. We look forward to being a productive member of the community for years to come. Springfield turns out early for opening day Hey, don t know if you heard, but weed is legal in Illinois. We are almost 2 hours in, and the line is still stretching around the block for Illinois Supply and Provisions in Springfield. People have been in line since 1 PM YESTERDAY pic. twitter. com/bIct7zgrpm Cole Henke ( cole Henke) January 1, 2020 Equity license applicant early in line 6:56 a. m. , Chicago One of the early customers at Chicago s Sunnyside cannabis store was Elise Swopes, age 30, from the Wrigleyville area. A medical cannabis patient since summer, she s helping her cousin Aaron apply for an equity license to sell cannabis. We re excited to be a part of it, she said. She said she s extremely hopeful for her cousin, Aaron, who gets bonus points on his application for having a cannabis conviction. The latest data available show that Illinois police made over 34,000 cannabis arrests in 2016, the majority of them for simple possession. David Downs Surreal in the best possible way Local reacted on social media to the state s first morning of legal sales. Today I am going to get into my car, drive 2 minutes down the road, enter a store, and purchase legal weed. This is so surreal, in the best possible way But don t think I won t get loud as hell if we don t see license priority for POC this year, Illinois. stephanie lynn ( stephanieIynnnn) January 1, 2020 Its 2020 and this part of Illinois doesn t smell like weed. Guess that argument of if you make it legal, everyone will do it didn t pan out, huh? LILWOOLEY ( theLILWOOLEY) January 1, 2020 After seeing the prices of Illinois weed they can go ahead and make that shit illegal again, at least it was affordable before Stevie Rich ( rich stevie) January 1, 2020 We got weed! in Joliet 6:37 a. m. , Joliet Just prior to opening at 6:00 a. m. , the atmosphere at Rise in Joliet was jovial despite the frigid 20 degree temperatures. The first person in line, Casey, had been there since 1:30 a. m. We wanted to wait inside our cars, where we had heat, but two other cars pulled in and we saw people getting out. So we beat them to the door! As the clock showed 5:59:50, the crowd began counting down. 5 4 3 2 1 YEEESSSSS! Casey was beaming as he completed his purchase. One item he was really pleased with? Got a pre roll White 99! The staff at Rise also gave him a free grinder for being there on opening day. Rise boasts that the family of its founder, Ben Kovler, played a part in the first prohibition: Rise s founder, Ben Kovler, comes from a legacy of post prohibition pioneers. His great grandfather, Harry Blum, invested in Jim Beam back in the early 30 s and transformed it into one of America s most iconic brands. Some of the folks in line were reluctant to be photographed. You don t want your boss to know? one person asked. I don t want my MOM to know! another answered. My work thinks I m in Chicago! As another happy customer headed out the door, he shouted as he held up his bag, WE GOT WEED! The crowd cheered in response. Brandon Weber Cannabis history made before dawn in Chicago 6:25 a. m. , Chicago Who says cannabis consumers aren t productive? While most of America snored through their New Year s Day hangover Illinois cannabis fans donned skiwear and braved sub freezing temperatures to smoke a piece of state history before dawn. Thirty five year old Forest Park resident Jackie Ryan took the sleep aid melatonin and went to bed at 7 p. m. on New Year s Eve to get up at 1 a. m. on New Year s Day and become the first in line to purchase legal cannabis in Illinois state history this morning. At 6 a. m central standard time, Ryan bought a pre roll, an edible, and an eighth ounce of Durban Poison for 120 as the crowd whooped and an international video feed broadcasted the images by satellite worldwide. Hundreds more customers waited outside. Ryan said she did it to be a part of history. I really didn t think I d ever see this day in Illinois. She said she knows people who ve gotten into major trouble with cannabis, including one friend who was imprisoned in Texas. She said legalization will absolutely change the conversation in the midwest. Video of first sale. pic. twitter. com/47PhuisqrQ David Downs ( davidrdowns) January 1, 2020 More than 100 people many still smelling of alcohol, or intoxicated from New Year s Eve revelry stamped their feet and tried to keep their hands warm in 21 degree darkness. Aaron Schneider, 24, from Boystown said he was standing 3rd in line in the cold outside for Weed! Schneider said he didn t vote for Gov. J. B. Pritzker, but he got the job done with regard to cannabis. Schneider got in line at 1:30 a. m. , part of a plan to spend the evening making history. The first time Schneider smoked weed he was 16, it was the 4th of July, it was great. He said Illinois legalization was inevitable after Colorado started in 2012. Cancer patient among first in line for rec sales 5:15 a. m. , Chicago Outside the Sunnyside cannabis store in Chicago s Wrigleyville neighborhood, one of the first guys in line in the cold was Dustin Kennedy, age 30, from the neighborhood. When his wife started getting sleepy after midnight, he excused himself to get in line. He forgot his ID though, meaning he could not buy anything. So his wife got up, came over, and dropped it off. Don t call me again, she said. The first time Kennedy had smoked was age 18, out of a soda can. He said he knew people busted for cannabis and it fucked their life up. Kennedy planned on spending 200 max, with his wife s permission on edibles and transdermal patches. He can t smoke. Kennedy is currently in treatment for lung cancer, and cannabis helps a lot with the itching and insomnia caused by his cancer medication. Kennedy said he knew legalization would come to Illinois eventually. I m excited to see the tax revenue. They need the money for sure.

For how we got here, read Illinois Just Legalized Cannabis. Here s What Happens Next Know before you go Gov. Pritzker clears 11,000 cannabis convictions CHICAGO (AP) Illinois governor granted more than 11,000 pardons for low level marijuana convictions on Tuesday, describing the step as a first wave of thousands of such expungements anticipated under the state s new marijuana legalization law. The expungement process is a key part of the law, which takes effect Wednesday and made Illinois the 11th state to legalize marijuana for people 21 or older. When they crafted the policy, Illinois lawmakers said they wanted to repair some of the damage caused by law enforcement s efforts to combat sale and use of the drug, particularly in minority communities. Tomorrow, Illinois will become the 11th state to legalize and regulate adult use cannabis. But our state is today doing something that sets us apart: Illinois is putting equity first, clearing thousands of convictions and giving individuals their families a new lease on life. pic. twitter. com/IgoOJCAlZj Governor JB Pritzker ( GovPritzker) December 31, 2019 Pritzker announced the pardons at a church on Chicago s South Side. He said clearing the misdemeanor offenses from individuals records will make it easier for them to get jobs, housing and financial aid for college. State officials estimate that 116,000 convictions involving 30 grams or less of marijuana, including for possession of the drug, are eligible for pardons under the new law. Illinois State Police are responsible for identifying those convictions and sending the records to the state s Prisoner Review Board, which then forwarded eligible cases to the governor s office for pardons. Everybody s getting ready This will no doubt be the single largest gathering of my high school s graduating class since 2004 pic. twitter. com/xn1WW8Qdda Parker Molloy ( ParkerMolloy) January 1, 2020 Too high? Here s how to help Somebody s gonna overdo it and get too high. It happens on every opening day. With edibles, remember: Start low, go slow. If you haven t tried an edible before, try a low dose like 5mg or 10 mg, give it at least an hour to fully kick in, and enjoy the ride. If you find yourself or a friend kinda out there, Leafly has a couple great resources. The main thing to remember: Stay calm and breathe. This too shall pass. Nobody has ever died from consuming too much cannabis. Pro tip: Don t take it out of state You think those Indiana state troopers are sleeping late on New Year s Day? Think again. Prohibition states often like to make a statement by mounting emphasis patrols near the borders of legal states. In 2016, a federal court ordered Kansas state troopers to stop the practice of pulling over cars with Colorado plates just because they suspected their drivers of possessing cannabis. If history repeats, there will be plenty of state police cars prowling the east west highways near the Illinois border this week. Here s the risk you run in those border states for a first offense. (Information courtesy of our friends at NORML. ) Indiana: Possession of up to 1 ounce 180 days in jail, 1,000 fine Kentucky: Possession of up to 8 ounces 45 days in jail, 250 fine Missouri: Possession of up to 10 grams 500 fine Iowa: Possession of any amount 6 months in jail, 1,000 fine Wisconsin: Possession of any amount 6 months in jail, 1,000 fine Illinois and Michigan share a border in the middle of Lake Michigan, and cannabis possession is legal for adults in Michigan, but crossing state lines with cannabis remains technically illegal. So don t do it, even in a boat.

Wrigleyville,"Recreational Cannabis: Supply Shortage Happened as Expected, Experts Say On its seventh day, the Illinois recreational cannabis industry was marked with short supplies, long lines, and in some cases, shuttered dispensaries Tuesday. And no one in the industry was surprised. Day one and week one are not perfect, Pharmacann s Jeremy Unruh said. But they are going as we anticipated. For months, just about everyone in the cannabis industry warned that supplies would most likely dwindle to zero after recreational marijuana launched on Jan. 1. As expected, some dispensaries closed completely this week, while others imposed purchase limits, or sold only to medical patients (State law mandates that medical cannabis users get first priority). We have limited supplies left, said Jason Erkes, spokesman for Cresco Labs. We re certainly out of some products and some strains, but we put rations in place at the beginning when things launched to make sure we could stretch our products as far as we can to make sure we serve as many recreational customers as we can. At Cresco s Sunnyside dispensary in Wrigleyville Tuesday, customers waited as long as four hours in line to get a chance at whatever they could buy. Queing up in a vacant bank a block away, patrons were warned about the purchase limits of one item per category (flowers, concentrates, and edibles). Gavin Fox told NBC 5 he waited about four hours in line. I tried on the second day, he said. But the line was far too extensive. it wasn t worth the wait. The state s largest dispensary, The Herbal Center on Ogden Avenue, shut down recreational sales completely over the weekend, giving preference to their medical customers. We will resume with sales of edibles, topicals, etc. on Friday, spokesman Courtney Greve Hack told NBC 5. No flower sale date set until they can feel confident they have enough for medical patients. Cresco and Pharmacann both raise cannabis, in addition to selling it. But Pharmacann s Unruh says that does not give companies like his a leg up, because state laws say they can t favor their own dispensaries. That s a regulatory requirement that we take very seriously, he told NBC 5. Over the last five years we have developed very strong wholesale relationships with the other cultivators in Illinois, and we ve spent the last several months leveraging and working those wholesale relationships to make sure that we re prepared for day one, week one, month one. For now, expect the shortages to continue possibly for weeks or even months as demand continues to run high. Right now, all the cultivators in the state are ramping up their production and expanding their facilities so there will be deliveries that come in on a regular basis for the next couple of months, Erkes said. But spring is really when we ll see all that product come to market. "
Wrigleyville,"Everybody must get stoned: The search for legal weed Well, they ll stone you when you re trying to be so good They ll stone you just like they said they would They ll stone you when you re trying to go home And they ll stone you when you re there all alone But I would not feel so all alone Everybody must get stoned Recreational marijuana has been legal in Illinois since the start of 2020. Seven entire days. The trick is trying to get some. It ain t easy kids. There have been long lines and a shortage of product. The dispensaries have been running out early. A common theme has been to try again tomorrow . and then the next day and the next day. It s frustrating! It would be even worse if I actually want to use the product. I just want to see what a dispensary is like and write about this. Sheesh! Wednesday, January 1, 2020: It s New Year s Day! Opening day for the legal weed industry in Illinois. I wanted to check out my local pot shop, but the early lines were around the block. I figured if I waited until the afternoon, maybe it would die down a bit. It did, but not enough. The line was still long. A security guard told me to come back tomorrow at nine. I knew this was a possibility, so I wasn t too disappointed.

Things are looking good. No one is in line. There s no police or security guarding the door. Maybe the novelty is wearing off? I reach the front door, pull on the handle and nothing happens. I try again nothing. The door is locked. Maybe you need to get buzzed inside? But there s not a buzzer. What the hell is going on here? I pull out my phone and do a little Googling. Hmmm the store is closed on Mondays!! Are you kidding me? It s the first full work week of the new year and people can t get the weed they need to make it through? Sigh! Monday, January 6, 2020 3 pm: I m not giving up. The shop in Wrigleyville isn t the only one in my hood. There s another one a couple of miles north. Let s see what the story is up there. It s a different tune, but the lyrics are the same. Out of product. Come back tomorrow. Tuesday, January 7, 2020 1 pm: Another search, another bus ride. Back to uptown. No lines.

Get breakfast, run errands, go home. We ll text you when your number is close. You come back and get to come inside. Hmmmm that sounds pretty efficient. The only problem is getting up at 6ish to make this work. I don t want to do this bad enough to do that, especially when the temperature is around twenty. A different type of chill and not the good kind. I went back to the dispensary in Wrigleyville. I m nothing if not persistent. Again, no lines in front. Hmmm what do you think the story is this time. Turns out their line is at a building a block away. I walked over see persistent. There s the line. I asked how long? THREE HOURS!!!! I GIVE UP!!!!!!!!

Wrigleyville,"Illinois COVID-19 Update: IL surpasses 1M total coronavirus cases with 8,757 new cases, 177 deaths EMBED More News Videos The impact of vaccinations may not have a positive impact on the daily COVID 19 numbers until spring, Dr. Jen Ashton says. EMBED More News Videos Governor JB Pritzker announces that Illinois is lowering tha age to get a COVID 19 vaccine in Phase 1B of the state's distribution plan. EMBED More News Videos The impact of vaccinations may not have a positive impact on the daily COVID 19 numbers until spring, Dr. Jen Ashton says. See where COVID 19 vaccine doses have been administered CHICAGO (WLS) Illinois surpassed Thursday one million total COVID 19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic. Health officials reported 8,757 and 177 deaths Thursday. The total number of cases in Illinois now stands at 1,008,045, with a total of 17,272 deaths, since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic. It took 349 days for the state to go from one confirmed case to 1 million. Now nearly one in 12 people in the state has tested positive for COVID 19. Barbara Sapstein was diagnosed with COVID 19 last March. She spent six weeks in a coma at Northwestern Medical Center, and nearly two of those weeks on a ventilator. ""Probably somewhere around 20 to 25 people that I personally know have had COVID,"" she said. ""I don't know how you can be anything without sad. Even with the vaccine's arrival, the state remains in a tenuous place. ""In a pandemic that has contained far too many tragic milestones, today's marking of one million cases of COVID 19 diagnosed in Illinois deserves particular recognition,"" said Governor JB Pritzker. ""As this disease continues to wreak havoc on our nation with the United States setting another record for the most COVID 19 deaths in a day just yesterday it is critical that we take extra caution today and in the months ahead to reduce the spread, bring down hospitalization rates, and save lives. Now that vaccine distribution has begun, we can see the light at the end of this difficult time let's do everything we can to ensure all of our neighbors are able to be there as we cross that finish line, healthy as well. With that goal in mind, I encourage all Illinoisans to choose to receive the protections of the COVID 19 vaccine when it's your turn in line. """"As the vaccine rolls out, our hope, and goal, is that the number of new cases we see each day will decrease,"" said IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike. ""Reporting more than one million COVID 19 cases in Illinois seemed like an unlikely number at the beginning of the pandemic, and we've now all seen how devastating this disease can be. I urge everyone to continue to wear their mask, avoid social gatherings, and get vaccinated when it's your turn. ""Within the past 24 hours, laboratories have reported 105,518 specimens for a total 13,803,946. As of Wednesday night, 3,921 patients in Illinois were reported to be in the hospital with COVID 19. Of those, 783 patients were in the ICU and 450 patients with COVID 19 were on ventilators. The preliminary seven day statewide test positivity from Dec. 31 Jan. 6 is 9.8%. The test positivity rate is a metric the state began providing in late October. It is calculated by using the total number of positive tests over the total number of tests. This is the metric being used to by state health officials to make decisions about mitigations. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker gave an update on the COVID 19 vaccine policy Wednesday. The total number of cases in Illinois now stands at 999,288, with a total of 17,096 deaths, since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic. Though the CDC has recommended that people 75 and older be vaccinated next, Illinois is expanding that group to people 65 and older. ""While the highest count of COVID 19 deaths is among those 75 and older, the majority of our Black and brown populations are dying well before that,"" said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Dept. of Public Health. At his press conference on Wednesday, Governor Pritzker provided updated guidelines of Phase 1B of the COVID 19 vaccination plan. Anyone over the age of 65, as well as frontline essential workers, will be able to get the vaccine in that phase. Those frontline essential workers include: first responders, teachers and those who work in childcare, grocery store workers, public transit employees and more. ""ACIP's guidance serves as the foundational blueprint for Illinois' Phase 1B plan, with one key adjustment: here in Illinois we are more strongly pursuing equity in the distribution of our vaccinations,"" said Governor JB Pritzker. ""For people of color, multi generational institutional racism in the provision of healthcare has reduced access to care, caused higher rates of environmental and social risk, and increased co morbidities. I believe our exit plan for this pandemic must, on balance, overcome structural inequalities that has allowed COVID 19 to rage through our most vulnerable communities. ""There are approximately 3.2 million people in Illinois that can get a vaccine during Phase 1B. ""With limited amounts of vaccine available at this time, it is important to prioritize individuals who are at greatest risk of exposure to COVID 19 and those at greatest risk of severe illness or death,"" said IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike. ""Generally, Latinx and Black populations have been disproportionately impacted by COVID 19 with data showing related deaths at younger ages. We are hopeful that by lowering the eligibility age to 65 years we can help reduce this disparity. ""Officials say the vaccine rollout has been sluggish because of the amount of supply coming from the federal government, as well as some vaccine hesitancy even among healthcare workers but they expect things to accelerate in the next few weeks. With vaccinations in their fourth week at long term care facilities and hospitals, officials say one third of Illinois' healthcare workers outside of Chicago have received at least one dose in a slower than expected rollout. ""The good news is that the incoming Biden administration has pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act, so that we expect the vaccine production will grow significantly in the coming month,"" Gov. JB Pritzker said. To administer shots to the more than 3 million Illinoisans in that next phase, officials plan to rely on the National Guard, which was instrumental in staffing large testing sites. ""They'll be assisting others and doing it themselves, depending on their expertise, of course, and using arenas as you're describing all across the state,"" Gov. JB Pritzker said. With infection rates generally trending in the right direction, Gov. Pritzker said on January 15 after the impact of holiday travel is known regions that meet the metrics can exit Tier 3 mitigation. That would not necessarily allow indoor dining to resume, but would reopen some businesses. Right now, Will and Kankakee Counties, as well as suburban Cook, and the city of Chicago are among the regions that meet the criteria to exit Tier 3 mitigation. ""My prayer for the new year is that everyone stays healthy and all of our regions continue to move in the right direction and I ask this from all Illinoisans to join me in making that possible by wearing a mask,"" he said. Thursday morning, a new COVID 9 rapid testing facility will be opening in Wrigleyville. The drive through testing site will be open from 8:30 a. m. to 5 p. m. at 3650 N Clark St. The test positivity rate is a metric the state began providing in late October. It is calculated by using the total number of positive tests over the total number of tests. This is the metric being used to by state health officials to make decisions about mitigations.

From photographer Sophie Gamand s pit bull adoption event, where visitors can meet their new best friend, to the unforgettable and deeply human work of the late Chris Hondros and other conflict photographs who followed in his footsteps, Photoville 2016 takes us around the world and back home again, reminding us of the power photography has always held while pointing to a future none of us can predict. We put together this list of 15 exhibitions we re most excited to see, ranging from the clever to the profound and everything in between. Photoville opens today at 4:00 PM. EXHIBITION: Flower Power, September 21 25, 2016. Presented by Sophie Gamand. The photography of Sophie Gamand has saved the lives of countless shelter dogs, including pit bull type dogs, who are euthanized across the country more frequently than any other kind of dog (about one million per year) due to prejudice and stereotypes. By dressing homeless pit bulls in flower crowns, Gamand has not only helped to further the worldwide movement against breed based discrimination and legislation, but she has also encouraged people to adopt many of the gentle creatures featured in her portraits. Photoville 2016 marks the artist s first solo exhibition in the United States, and to celebrate the occasion some of her canine models will be joining her for a very Special Flower Power Dog Adoption event. All will be on the lookout for loving homes in the crowd. Ami Vitale / National Geographic EXHIBITION: Rewilding Pandas in China, September 21 25, 2016.

Sadie Quarrier curates this exhibition from Vitale s three years with the pandas. We live here, we were born here, we have grown up here.

In this version, audience members are invited to curate and arrange the work themselves, much like one does with refrigerator magnets. As time passes, the exhibition will change meanings based on who sets foot inside. Kristal Bush has visited loved ones in Pennsylvania prisons for 22 years.

Schereville,"Ford dealership gets 40 orders for Mustang Mach-E in one night Imagine getting 40 customers in one night for a vehicle that starts at 43,895 and reaches 60,500. Steve Fuentes did. ""And we're up to 100 reservations now,"" he said. ""The Mustang Mach E has had a tremendous positive response. This is one of the biggest game changers we've ever had. "" The owner of Sunnyvale Ford in the heart of Silicon Valley raved about response to the 2021 Mustang Mach E SUV at a dealership located just blocks from Tesla, the rival high profile electric carmaker led by controversial CEO Elon Musk. ""I just think the market is ripe and it's ready for something other than Tesla. Our all electric SUV with a 300 mile range is super cool and functional. "" Fuentes noted that the high efficiency vehicle will allow drivers to use special commuter lanes in the notoriously congested West Coast highways. ""It's like the e ticket at Disneyland,"" he said. More than one in four buyers of the now sold out first edition version of the Mach E lives in California. Yet response from other parts of America to the vehicle has been immediate. Tom Nardone, 49, an entrepreneur from Birmingham, Michigan, placed his 500 reservation for a base model 2021 Mustang Mach E with all wheel drive within hours of watching the unveiling on YouTube. ""I'm interested in efficiency. I like the idea of a Tesla but I don't trust Tesla. I would've bought a Chevrolet Bolt but it wasn't very attractive. Right now I'm driving a 2020 Camry hybrid. I love it. This new vehicle will replace my wife's 2017 Dodge Journey. "" Mike Van Camp, 36, an industrial metal fabrication contractor from Schereville, Indiana, chose the Mustang Mach E GT nearly two decades after buying a 2001 GT yellow convertible. ""I was looking for something sporty and considered getting a Jeep Gladiator. But this, it's the first of its kind and I can say I was there when it first came out. "" Anne Thimm, 58, a retired analyst from Alexandria, Virginia, laughs when she talks about her love of Mustang. ""Back in 2001, the Mustang Bullitt came out and I just fell in love with that car. I walked into a Ford dealership and the guy said to me, 'Honey, don't you think that's a little too much for you?' Like, really? I was just floored. I was ready to pay cash for that car. So I walked right out and went to another Ford dealership 15 miles down the road and got my Bullitt. I loved that car. "" She sadly parted with the Mustang to transport her four dogs. ""I mourn that car every day,"" Thimm said. ""Now we can get a Mustang to haul our dogs and also have electric. When I saw the Mach E, I thought, 'Oh my God, it checks all our boxes. ' It's fun and it has plenty of room. "" Soon she will replace her Toyota Highlander hybrid with a first edition red Mach E. Matt Stanford, general manager at Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor, said he has totaled 70 orders for the Mach E already. ""And I actually ordered one for myself, a black GT,"" he confessed. ""I have professors who have ordered, doctors, Ford employees, folks looking for an answer to the combustible engine people concerned about their carbon footprint. I've got folks in their mid 20s all the way up to their late 60s. "" This is new territory for Ford, said Stanford, whose uncles founded the dealership and whose family members sell cars. ""Ford, instead of sticking its toe in the pool, jumped completely into the deep end. Tesla has owned the market. Tesla is just killing it. There's a sexiness to the Tesla vehicle. It's a status symbol, almost a way of life for some people. It's a sleek, nice looking car. So Ford's going at 'em. "" First editions are selling mostly in Carbonized Gray at 38%, Grabber Blue Metallic at 35% and Rapid Red at 27%. More than 80% of U. S. customers are reserving Mach E with an extended range battery. About 55% are buying all wheel drive. Almost 30% are choosing the top model GT. The Dearborn automaker doesn't reveal the number of first editions sold but does note that the company has promised only 50,000 Mach E vehicles that will be sold for the first 12 months in the U. S. , Canada and Europe, and then other markets including China, Ford spokeswoman Emma Bergg confirmed. There are four other trim levels besides the first edition. A potential tax credit of 7,500 will be applied to the prices below: Select, from 43,895 Premium, from 50,600 First Edition, from 59,900 California Route 1, from 52,400 GT from 60,500 While some Mustang aficionados freaked out when Ford announced the iconic pony car's name would be used on an SUV, many Mustang collectors loved the idea. ""I own a silver 2005 Mustang GT,"" Nardone said. ""I'm dying to get rid of that Mustang. It gets 12 miles to the gallon. This electric Mustang is going to be quicker than my Mustang GT. "" Van Camp, who drives a 2017 Ford Explorer for work, has been searching for years for the right car and all electric didn't play a key role in his decision. ""I was definitely dead set on buying a Mustang and after I saw the Mach E, I definitely knew I wanted that Mustang. ""It'll probably be an evening car, a weekend car.

Egbertville,"Community board meetings resume this week STATEN ISLAND, N. Y. The aesthetics of a developer s plan to surround the Kreischer Mansion with a new active adult residential community will be presented to Community Board 3 s land use committee on Wednesday, Jan. 8. Architect Ron Victorio will make the presentation about the Charleston property at 7:30 p. m. in the board office, 1243 Woodrow Rd. The application is required because the mansion has been designated a historic landmark. Victorio is aiming to convince the committee that the plan by developer Isaac Yomtovian to build 48 homes for adults ages 55 and older is aesthetically appropriate to be placed on land adjacent to the historic home, located at 4500 Arthur Kill Rd. A plan to build 126 homes on the land, which had received approval in 2005, has been scrapped in favor of the active adult community, Victorio said. After the full Community Board votes later in the month, the plan will be brought to the Landmark Preservation Commission for approval on aesthetics. An LPC public hearing is scheduled for Feb. 4, he said. The development will pick up elements of the mansion, colors of the mansion, the style of the mansion, but will not copy it, Victorio said. ""The mansion has to remain the pinnacle on the hill,'' he said. ""The mansion has to be respected. '' The Community Board 3 Quality of Life Committee will meet on Tuesday, at 7:30 p. m. in the board office. Community Board 1 will consider several building applications on Wednesday, Jan. 8, at 7 p. m. , during a land use public hearing in its board headquarters, 1 Edgewater Plaza.

Coombsville,"Take the Napa County highway trivia quiz Napa County has six highways and freeways running through it or is it seven? The answer to this seemingly straightforward question isn t quite clear. Here s a trivia but hopefully not trivial look at the county s main roads. What is the shortest stretch of highway or freeway within the county? This ends up being a trick question. Some maps show about 1,000 feet of Highway 37 passing through Napa County, others show it staying in Sonoma and Solano counties. Napa County Public Works Director Steven Lederer said he think Highway 37 does enter Napa County, but it s hard to tell. Planning, Building and Environmental Services Director David Morrison said Google Earth shows a segment might be in Napa County, though he s inclined to say no. County Assessor John Tuteur said no. Take away the Highway 37 conundrum and the answer is Interstate 80. The southeast corner of the county takes in a mile of the freeway between Vallejo and Fairfield. What is Napa County s longest stretch of highway or freeway? Highway 29, the Napa Valley s main drag. It traverses the entire county north to south, from the remote, forested Lake County line near Mount St. Helena to bustling, congested American Canyon. That s a distance of about 49 miles. Highway 128 cutting west to east across the county is almost as long, at 46.5 miles. This highway enters the northern county from Sonoma County, runs down the Napa Valley sharing the Highway 29 route, cuts east on Rutherford Road, then heads past Lake Hennessey and Lake Berryessa to Solano County. What are the six or seven highways and freeways stretches in Napa County? Highways 12, 29, 121, 128 and 221 and I 80 for sure, with Highway 37 a possibility. When did the Jameson Canyon highway get built? With automobiles becoming popular, the state in 1912 announced it would spend 18 million on a state highway system. Napa County wanted to be included. California was securing local right of way in 1914. The cement highway would come westward from Sacramento through Fairfield, go through Jameson Canyon into Napa County, pass through the city of Napa, then cut west to Sonoma County and beyond. A milestone came in November 1918. The new state highway south of Napa was thrown open to the public Monday, the Weekly Calistogan reported. This is a great boon to automobilists bound for Vallejo or Sacramento points, for it does away with the wide detour so long necessary out through Coombsville. In December, 1919, California completed the state highway section from the city of Napa to Stanly Lane heading toward Sonoma. Meanwhile, the county also worked on county highways, such as today s Highway 29 route up Napa Valley. What is the busiest Napa County highway/freeway? No, it s not Highway 29 in American Canyon, the city of Napa or the Upvalley not by a long shot. Highway 29 at its busiest point in Napa County near First Street in the city of Napa carries about 71,000 vehicles daily. That short stretch of I 80 in the south county carries around 145,000, according to Caltrans. Does Napa County have a state scenic highway? No. But the county has some contenders, should local officials ever want to the state to put up those scenic highway signs with the poppy. California law passed in 1963 allowed for state scenic highways and listed eligible highways. Listed for Napa County are Highway 29 from Vallejo to the city of Napa, Highway 29 from the city of Napa to Lake County, Highway 221 and Silverado Trail (Highway 121) south of Trancas Street. Last year, Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar Curry, D Winters, carried legislation that makes Highway 128 eligible. But the state doesn t impose scenic highway status on counties. Napa County has yet to apply and show its roads meet the criteria. You can reach Barry Eberling at 256 2253 or beberling napanews. com. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

Coombsville,"Historic Napa winery Stony Hill sold to Heitz Cellar owner Lawrence Jr and McCoy Jr MS announced their purchase of Stony Hill Vineyard on 23 December. Financial details were not disclosed. The move marks a fresh chapter for Stony Hill, one of the legendary names of Napa Valley winemaking and which saw its first harvest in 1952. It is the latest of several deals involving businessman Gaylon Lawrence. He and McCoy Jr acquired Burgess Cellars in September. McCoy is president and CEO of Heitz Cellar, which Lawrence acquired in 2018 following that up in 2019 by acquiring Haynes Vineyard in Napa s Coombsville AVA. At Stony Hill, the new owners have appointed Jaimee Motley as winemaker. Stony Hill Vineyard has held a special place in my heart since my initial visit to the winery in 2011 after the harvest, said Motley, who has been assistant winemaker at Pax Wine Cellars and also launched wines under her own name. The estate feels as if there are ten different clos within the property and each of those parcels has the ability to present us a looking glass into the history of California terroir and the future of transparent winegrowing, she said. I look forward to maintaining a deep reverence with the land, honouring the past, and embracing the future of Stony Hill. Laurie Taboulet, who was formerly national sales manager at Larkmead Vineyards, has been appointed Stony Hill s estate director. Stony Hill was founded by Fred and Eleanor McCrea, who bought the property in 1943 as a weekend getaway. They initially planted 2.4 hectares of vines (six acres), including Chardonnay, Riesling and Pinot Blanc, and the first wines quickly found favour with wine lovers in the 1950s. Gew rztraminer, S millon, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah were later added. Fred McCrea developed the winemaking, while Eleanor handled the business side. After Fred s death in 1977, his assistant Michael Chelini took on the winemaking for the subsequent 40 years. During that time, in 1991, the McCreas son Peter and daughter in law, Willinda, assumed day to day management of the winery. In 2011, their daughter Sarah joined the business, although in 2018 a majority stake in Stony Hill was sold to Ted Hall and family owners of Long Meadow Ranch. You might also like:"
Monteville,"Close to 20,000 march across Brooklyn Bridge against anti-Semitism Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teams Thousands of people marched from Foley Square in Manhattan across the Brooklyn Bridge on Sunday in an act of solidarity against anti Semitism amid a wave of hate crimes in New York City and beyond. The march, dubbed No Fear. No Hate, was organized by Jewish organizations such as the United Jewish Appeal Federation, the Anti Defamation League, American Jewish Committee along with other community organizations. The event drew a crowd of nearly 20,000 people, according to the mayor s office. Since Dec. 23, there have been at least 13 anti Semitic incidents in New York City, with the most recent attack occurring on Jan. 2 when two women beat and shouted slurs at an Orthodox Jewish man in Williamsburg. Over the last two years, attacks against Jewish people made up almost half of all reported hate crimes, according to the NYPD. Right now, as a Jew, I am scared to send my children to school, said Roxane Steinhauser, 38, who has been called slurs on the subway and walking in her neighborhood of Crown Heights. We should not be afraid to walk in the street, or of showing our Judaism. Steinhauser added that she worries about the world her children will live in 10 years if something isn t done now to stomp out hatred. Elected officials representing all parts of the city marched alongside New Yorkers and visitors, including Senator Chuck Schumer and Governor Andrew Cuomo, who will propose a law this upcoming legislative session to label hate crimes as a form of domestic terrorism. Cuomo also announced that an additional 45 million of state funds would go towards non public schools and religious institutions to increase security and that there would be an increased police presence in vulnerable communities. What happened in Brooklyn and what happened in Monsey is an attack on every New Yorker, the governor said. On Dec. 14, a man forced his way into a rabbi s home in the upstate city and attacked five people with a machete during a Hanukkah celebration. But participants acknowledged that the uptick in hate is not confined to New York. There is rising hatred against all minorities in this country, said David Sumka, 53, from Monteville, New Jersey. To Sumka and other marchers, the march is more about stopping hate in general, not just against Jews. It s reached a threshold where it can t be tolerated, added Barbara Franklin, 65, from Morristown, New Jersey. "
Coitsville,"Kentucky & Ohio Supreme Courts Address Police, Government Liability For Damage Caused During Vehicle Pursuits ARTICLE To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq. com. Fort Wright, Kentucky (January 8, 2019) Two recent decisions, one from the Supreme Court of Kentucky and the other from the Supreme Court of Ohio, addressed the issue of liability for police officers and political subdivisions, respectively, following claims that arose from motor vehicle accidents caused during suspect vehicle pursuits. The two courts took opposing views, with one expanding liability and the other limiting it. This alert provides a summary of these cases. Kentucky Expands Liability for Officers In Gonzalez v. Johnson, 581 S. W.3d 529 (Ky. 2019), the Supreme Court of Kentucky held that: (1) insofar as Chambers v. Ideal Pure Milk Co. , 245 S. W.2d 589 (Ky. 1952) holds that an officer cannot be the proximate or legal cause of damage inflicted on a third party by a fleeing suspect, Chambers is overruled and (2) an officer can be the cause in fact and legal cause of damages inflicted upon a third party as a result of a negligent pursuit. In the case before the circuit court, a third party decedent was killed when a criminal suspect crashed into his vehicle during a high speed chase initiated by a deputy sheriff. The deputy witnessed the criminal suspect allegedly involved in a drug deal, run a red light and, without authorization, began to pursue the suspect. As a result of this unauthorized pursuit, there were notably a number of factors that the court cited that were of particular concern. First, it had been raining, making the well traveled road slippery. Second, the cruiser that the deputy was using that evening was a K 9 unit. The partition in the cruiser was unlocked, and the restless dog was able to poke his head through the partition into the front seat. Lastly, while the lights on the deputy's cruiser were functioning, the siren was not. The deputy claimed he did not realize the siren was broken until two miles into the pursuit. The deputy testified that, although he knew pursing a suspect without his siren violated KRS 189.940 and the county Sheriff Department s practices, he continued the pursuit for about another mile. Immediately after the deputy decided to terminate the pursuit, the suspect s vehicle fishtailed out of control and hit the decedent's car. The decedent s estate filed a wrongful death suit against the deputy sheriff and the Sheriff s Department. The circuit court granted summary judgment for the defendants based on the precedent set in Chambers, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. However, the Supreme Court of Kentucky, citing the legislature s increased concern and acknowledgement of the need for increased precautions by law enforcement when responding to emergencies, reversed, overruling Chambers and holding that an officer can be the cause in fact and legal cause of damages inflicted upon a third party as a result of a negligent pursuit. The court also cited data regarding the frequency in which pursuit related fatalities were occurring, and further went on to state that despite the duty to apprehend law violators, a police officer's paramount duty is to protect the public. Conduct that causes a high risk of harm to the public is not justified unless the end itself is of sufficient social value. The general public has a significant interest in not being subjected to unreasonable risks of injury as the police carry out their duties therefore, in these circumstances, liability must attach to officers of the law. Ohio Limits Liability for Political Subdivisions In McConnell v. Dudley, 2019 Ohio 4740, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed a court of appeals judgment which held, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code 2744.02(B)(1), a political subdivision may be liable for its negligent failure to train its police officers in high speed pursuits. Therein, the court held that the statute at issue does not allow a political subdivision to be held liable for consequences arising from an employee's training or the supervision of that employee in operating a motor vehicle. In McConnell, a police officer was involved in a motor vehicle accident, with another vehicle driven by a third party, while the officer was responding to an emergency call. In pursuing a suspect, the officer approached an intersection and began to radio his position when he suddenly collided with a vehicle driven by the plaintiff, who was on her way to work. The plaintiff s car struck a utility pole and overturned, landing on its roof. The plaintiff sustained serious injuries. The officer knew that the intersection was controlled by a stop light, but he had not noticed that the light was red as he entered the intersection. The officer also testified that a house and tree had obstructed his view, blocking the approaching car. At the time of the collision, the officer s speed was approximately 35 m. p. h. The plaintiff and her family brought suit against the officer, as well as the Coitsville Township and its board of trustees, and the Coitsville Township Police Department (collectively, the Township), alleging that the Township had negligently hired, trained, or supervised the officer. The trial court denied the Township's motion for summary judgment asserting immunity, and the court of appeals affirmed in part. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed, holding that the Township was entitled to summary judgment, based on the language of the controlling statute, Ohio s Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act (R. C. 2744.02(B)). The court specifically pointed to the legislature s role in weighing public policy concerns through the Act, and found that because the statute s language is unambiguous, they must simply apply its plain meaning here. In doing so, the court found that the statute does not impose liability on a political subdivision for allegedly violating a duty in hiring, training, or supervising a police officer who is subsequently involved in an accident during a high speed pursuit of suspects. Police departments and political subdivisions in Kentucky and Ohio should be aware of these recent case law developments within their states, and should approach litigation brought as a result of police vehicle accidents with these decisions in mind. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. "
Coitsville,"Speaker shares messages of light and love YOUNGSTOWN Racism, hatred, corruption, degradation and numerous other ills may add layers of darkness to society, but people standing as beacons of light will always have the final word in the battle, a local minister contends. Darkness cannot drive out darkness but only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hatred only love can do that, the Rev. Juan M. Rivera said during his keynote presentation for a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. observance Thursday in the Chestnut Room at Youngstown State University s Kilcawley Center. Every single time light stands next to darkness, light wins. A few hundred students, community leaders, activists and others came to the one hour gathering, which was mainly to embrace, celebrate, observe and honor King s legacy of service to and support of people from all backgrounds. In his speech, Rivera, pastor of Victory Christian Center in Coitsville, echoed some of the late civil rights leader s rhetoric, challenging audience members to be a light to others, regardless of their majors, gender, backgrounds and other circumstances. He also stressed to his listeners that they have value and purpose. King consistently displayed the redemptive power of light and love while battling segregation in the Deep South, so it s important for people today to use their examples and inner power to love one another and avoid apathy, said Rivera, who also serves on the National Hispanic Leadership Conference, the Hispanic Israel Leadership Coalition and the Ohio Commission of Hispanic / Latino Affairs. Be a light by who you are, said Rivera, who also cited Genesis 1:2 and 1:3, which talk about how the world was under a roaring ocean of darkness before God commanded light to shine, then separated it from darkness. Before Rivera s address, four Martin Luther King Service Leadership Awards were given. Receiving the Emerging Leader and Student Leader awards were, respectively, Malik Montgomery, a YSU sophomore majoring in music technology and recording, and Jasmine Smyles, a YSU senior and exercise science major. The Campus Leader Award went to Crystal Hawthorne, the university s coordinator of teacher licensure and advisor for the Minority Education Association. The Community Leader Award recipient was 21 WFMJ TV. Accepting the honor was Madonna Chism Pinkard, Channel 21 s community relations director. We do a lot of diversity programs and have a committee on equity and inclusion work, Hawthorne explained. In addition, the Minority Education Association handles social justice issues and has held recent workshops on poverty and bullying. The MEA also is trying to launch a teacher cadet initiative at East High School largely to diversify the teacher workforce, and about 10 East High students are part of that effort, Hawthorne noted. Jacci Johnson, assistant director of YSU s Student Diversity Programs, said she strongly feels that if he was alive, King would fully embrace and celebrate a coalition of people who also are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. In addition, the civil rights leader and humanitarian would be a blunt realist and recognize then acknowledge that everyone should be included in such an effort, she continued. It would have been a non issue, said Johnson, who added that King might be disappointed that too often in today s fast paced, high tech society, little time and intellectual space are set aside for deep, meaningful conversations about race and other related issues. Additional remarks were from Marla Hergenrother of YSU Students United, who said the organization is to host an event Feb. 12 about fostering greater appreciation for different races and ethnicities. Thursday s observance also featured the Voices of YSU vocal group, which gave its rendition of Lift Every Voice and Sing, which was an anthem of the civil rights movement. The program concluded with everyone locking arms and singing We Shall Overcome, which also was sung frequently in the movement. news tribtoday. com"

Wrigglyville,"My 1st Year Living In Tuscaloosa Looking back, I was a wanderlust kid living in Wrigglyville, (a neighborhood inside Chicago) working at a classic rock station called, 97.1FM The Drive and working as a bartender/ karaoke host at a real shit hole Irish bar that I secretly adore in Lincoln Park (also another neighborhood inside Chicago, very old school part of town). Living the big city life with a great group of friends and support system. I lived with my best friends, drank with my best friends and did a lot of illegal things with those best friends. It was my gang, my tribe, my people. Looking back, I miss those moments and experiences we all had made together, it gives me euphoria just thinking about it. Time passed, seasons got colder and I became restless in a city that I knew better than the back of my hand. Some say, change is inevitable and impossible to fight, and they're damn right about that. I was scrolling the radio job boards and I found this cool little alt station in the middle of nowhere. So I submitted an application, three weeks later I was hired. There I was, at O'Hare airport a year ago on this date, a balmy 35 degrees, leaving the city I knew and loved. Arriving in Birmingham, I was greeted by my new boss and future best friend. The ride to Tuscaloosa was quick, lots of small talk and she let me in on the southern lingo and do's and dont's down south. Living here in Tuscaloosa, I've learned 8 things: A stranger will be a friend sometime soon. Never say War Eagle. Hold the door open for the person behind you. ""Roll Tide"" means anything you want it to mean. Try not to be a jerk, it's a small town, people talk. People gossip like it's their job down here. BBQ is king. People drive so damn slow. The city itself is beautiful, most tree's I've ever seen in my life, rolling hills, a stunning river that cuts this town in two like a knife. It's like a time machine has taken me back to the 1970's where things were more simple and enjoyable. People here are genuine, loving, accepting and true and honest story tellers. I feel like I've made my family down here and that's something I wouldn't have expected to have only lived a year here. Tuscaloosa has made me a more genuine person with a bigger heart. I feel welcomed here and I love it. Thanks for everyone who has made feel at home 800 miles away from my real one. Tuscaloosa will forever be my home away from home. Roll Damn Tide. "
Fajitaville,"Dozens take a plunge for the fight against ALS CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas While many rang in the new year at midnight, others opted to plunge into 2020 some 12 hours later. For the sixth year, North Beach and Fajitaville hosted the Corpus Christi Polar Bear Plunge. However, these brave souls weren't just plunging into the bay just for fun. Corpus Christi s plunge helps fund the fight against Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, better known as ALS. While there's no cure for ALS, organizers believe every dollar they raise gets doctors a little closer to finding one. The plunge brought people together from both near and far. I had never done a Polar Plunge before, said Scott Robinson of Spokane, Wash. From our point of view, with the weather so nice and warm, why not? Whether it was their first plunge or sixth, everyone was there to help the fight against ALS. I believe the person who started doing it has a family member who has (ALS), said plunger Kimberly Dixon. That's why she started it, to raise awareness and raise money. All registration fees go to the ALS Therapy Development Institute, and some even take the plunge when it comes to raising money. We also have some side challenges and fundraisers where we raise extra money, said event coordinator Alissa Mejia. People have also started teams and bought merchandise, so all that is going to the cause. Wednesday's temperatures were far from polar. The purists will say that this is not a real 'Polar Bear Plunge,' "" said Mejia. ""I know I'm from Massachusetts we work with what we've got. However, the plunge is more about giving hope to people looking for a miracle. It means an awful lot, we're a small community of people with ALS here, said Bob Chapman, whose wife is battling ALS. It's a horrible disease, and we really appreciate your help. Organizers expected to raise about 10,000 this year, bringing their six year total to a little more than 60,000. "
Basketville,"Welcome to THE COMMONS -- News and Views for Windham County, Vermont BRATTLEBORO Starting in April, Oak Meadow will begin its move from Brattleboro to Putney, an effort to consolidate staff from two sites in a building well suited for its publishing and mail order activities. Oak Meadow will rent approximately two thirds of the first floor of Basketville s headquarters at 8 Bellows Falls Rd. in Putney, said Steve Lorenz, its executive director and school liaison. The international organization provides distance education curriculum and programing for students in kindergarten through grade 12. Students in 69 countries plus the United States use the organization s curriculum. Currently, the organization occupies two separate sites in Brattleboro: Cotton Mill for its publishing and business arm, and Brooks House, where sales, marketing, and programing staff have worked out of offices overlooking Main and High Streets. Lorenz said the move will happen in two stages, with the staff at the Cotton Mill relocating to Putney in April. The staff at the Brooks House will move starting in late September. It s actually quite emotional, he said. Oak Meadow employs 20 staff and 30 teachers (a combination of full and part time). Some employees work remotely, said Lorenz. Approximately 15 staff will move to the Basketville property, where that company closed its retail outlet in 2018. Its wholesale operation remains in the building. Lorenz explained that the move grew out of a need to become more efficient as an organization and a desire to become more cohesive as colleagues. Approximately a year ago, the organization started looking at more effective ways to operate, Lorenz said. Through discussions with staff, he also realized that people wanted to improve how they work together. It was a tough decision, he said, praising the organization s current landlords, the Brattleboro Development Credit Corp. and Brooks House Realty. Lorenz called his office at the Brooks House the most beautiful office I ve ever worked in and said he will miss walking down Main Street. The search took a year because the organization needs a loading dock to ship and receive its publications. He estimates that Oak Meadow creates and publishes between 75 to 80 percent of the educational tools it sells. The Basketville building also has ample parking for employees and is an easy walk to the Putney General Store, Lorenz added. Putney also feels like an education hub, which is a good fit for the organization, he added, ticking off school names such as the Putney School, Landmark College, the Grammar School, and Greenwood School. The organization anticipates saving money because it will pay only one rent instead of two, he said. Ultimately, however, Lorenz said the main goal is to have all the organization s local staff under one roof. A need for the new and different Oak Meadow has recently gone through a few transitions, such as a change in executive directors two years ago, he said. According to the organization s website, before taking the leadership role at Oak Meadow two years ago, Lorenz served as head of the Grammar School. He has served as elementary school principal, and as secondary school, elementary school, and early childhood education teacher. Lorenz added that the organization decided not to return to the Cotton Mill because staff felt the need for a new space. The Cotton Mill is a fine location but we needed new and different, he said. Oak Meadow serves approximately 600 enrolled students, more than 5,000 individuals, and 100 schools in the United States. "

Knucklesville,"Auraria: The forgotten ghost town If you re driving north to Dahlonega and you decide to take the backroads, you may have passed through the community of Auraria. Some run down buildings on the side of the road are all that is left of it, and many would never guess they represent what was once a lively and thriving community. In fact, if those buildings could talk, they would tell us that this part of Lumpkin County has a rich history. GOLD FEVER Auraria is where it all started the gold rush of North Georgia. It was 1828 when gold was discovered and word spread fast. By 1829, thousands of hopeful prospectors rushed to North Georgia looking for their own treasure. Lots of communities in this area have their own gold rush stories, but none quite like Auraria. Auraria became the hub, the center of it all, the place where thousands of prospectors first settled, according to Chris Worick, president for the Lumpkin County Historical Society. He says that this particular gold rush was a first of its kind. Auraria was a phenomenon in that it was the very first boomtown gold rush boomtown in the whole United States. The reason it was a phenomenon is because there had never been a gold rush before, says Worick. This was the very first one, so it kind of took people by surprise because they didn t know how to react to this, so it kind of grew up out of nothing, basically on the frontier of GA at this time. Auraria was chosen because it was situated perfectly between the Etowah and Chestatee Rivers, perfect for gold mining, and hopeful miners converged upon the peaceful foothills. As soon as the news of gold spread, every day the number of those arriving increased. Worick says it s hard to know the actual numbers, but it was a large population. Anywhere from 1,000 up to as large as 10,000 there, so for sure, thousands of people. Now granted, miners moved around quite a bit so it was probably a transient camp of sorts where people would come and go on a very short notice. They are always chasing the next big strike, so it s hard to say at any given time how many thousands of people might have been living there. As large numbers of prospectors flocked to the area, Auraria went from being a single cabin to a thriving settlement. Miners quickly, almost overnight, built an entire town. It grew up so fast that thousands of people were attracted to come here and it created hotels, general stores, no shortage of taverns, ten pin alleys operating day and night, so just a rowdy atmosphere, and of course mining. There was even a mining company bank that was established with the Pigeon Roost Mining Company, says Worick. WHAT S IN A NAME The town was originally called Nuckolsville after Nathaniel Nuckolls, a local tavern owner. But many called it Knucklesville for the amount of fist fighting and rowdy behavior that took place. The first Auraria newspaper, printed in April of 1933, talks about how Auraria eventually got its name. It s Latin for gold or yellow money just like the word Dahlonega also means the same thing in the Cherokee language. MOVING ONWARD Auraria was a booming community, but only for a short time. Just as quickly as the thousands of miners came, they left. First, Dahlonega became a more conducive site to build on and the county seat was moved northward in 1833, with many business owners moving to the new town. Then, in 1848 gold was discovered in California and a majority of the prospectors headed west. WHAT REMAINS But what was left behind were still a few families. Auraria was still a community, even if the majority of its original residents were gone. Main street remained along with a hotel, post office, school and church and a few other buildings. In the center of town was the General Store. It remained long after all the other buildings were gone. Lynette Woody Stowers grew up in Auraria, her family dating back to the area from the late 1800 s. When I was a kid there was probably about 15 20 buildings there, but there s just a couple of buildings left. There was over 400 families that lived here at one time, she reminisces. There was a post office, a bowling alley, a couple of taverns of course, and a general store. And upstairs in the general store, where my mom owned, in the early days, there was a clothing store upstairs. Her family, the Woodys, bought the general store in the 1950 s and Lynette remembers fondly the days when Woody s General Store was thriving and the heart of the community. In the 50 s and 60 s and 70 s, the store was booming. When my mom and dad bought the store, my dad liked pin ball machines, so they put a pin ball machine in there, Stowers recalls fondly. They had a juke box and young people would come on Saturday nights and sing and dance. It was just a good, clean, fun place. No drinking, nothing like that going on. It was just a good, clean place to go. They had all the produce, meats, everything that you would have in a big store, but just on a smaller scale. Kate Woody kept the store open until 1997, running it for over 45 years. In fact, the intersection at Auraria is named after her, as she was an important part of the community. The longtime residents of Auraria still remember when the general store was a welcoming place for neighbors to gather. In the summertime, we had two big benches and people would congregate on the benches and you know that was just a chat place. And in the wintertime there was a big old pot bellied stove right in the center of the store and people would congregate around it and my mother always had a pot of coffee made, remembers Stowers. FORGOTTEN PAST Once the general store closed, there wasn t much left of Auraria. In fact, the Woody family sold it last year to a new owner. There are talks that he may restore it, and those who remember it in its prime are hopeful, but many others now call Auraria a ghost town. It s true the run down buildings are symbolic, as much of its history is being lost. Worick says it s hard to see so many important, historical buildings, and their bygone stories, in disrepair. It s one of these hidden treasures that has been so overlooked, he says. It s been talked about, but it s like a lot of things, it s being forgotten, sadly, because people don t really have a sense of history anymore, so these things are getting forgotten and overgrown and we might just have nothing more than just a historical marker to mark where this treasure in the Georgia mountains is located at some point. But hopefully we have some people who want to take this on and keep this memory alive. "
Monksville,"Lawmakers, marina owners lobby for funds to fight algae blooms, keep lakes open in summer WEST MILFORD Government officials and marina owners met on the frozen shore of Greenwood Lake on Thursday to lobby for emergency funds to prevent another summer marred by algae blooms. Gov. Phil Murphy announced late last year that the state would administer a 13 million grant program to allow lake communities to tackle the algae program that triggered no swimming advisories and economic struggles at North Jersey s largest lakes in 2019. Rep. Josh Gottheimer lauded the grant program Thursday but called for a mid year appropriations package from Trenton to provide the target communities with the matching funding needed to participate in the grant initiative. This cannot wait until the summer s budget negotiation, said Gottheimer, a Democrat who represents the 5th Congressional District. We have to act now. In addition to requesting an immediate investment from Trenton in a letter co signed by 11th District's Rep. Mikie Sherrill, 7th District's Tom Malinowsi and other state representatives, Gottheimer called for EPA assistance and the release of money from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to combat algae blooms. Summer of 2019 At Greenwood Lake and Lake Hopatcong, the summer of 2019 will be remembered for the high levels of blue green algae that triggered a no swimming advisory and depressed the summertime economy. The issue impacted nearly three dozen bodies of water in New Jersey last year, state records show. The problem stretches from Salem to Sussex. Moreover, there is no quick fix. We need to look at this comprehensively, Gottheimer said. We re going to need an annual investment here to keep our lakes in the shape they need to be in to make sure ecotourism grows. Potential treatments for the blooms range from herbicides to ultrasonic waves, but experts warn many are expensive and/or ineffective for large lakes. Management of a lake s nutrient load by addressing runoff, wastewater systems and other sources is a scientifically viable solution but could be extremely costly, they said. Short term efforts must also be considered before warmer weather returns in 2020, said Julia Somers, the executive director of the New Jersey Highlands Coalition. Left unchecked, blue green algae can consume enough of a lake s oxygen to suffocate fish and produce enough toxins to kill animals. News:Gov. Murphy vetoes bill to create annual 500,000 fund for Greenwood Lake Local:West Milford district's energy plan calls for solar panels at six schools, 7M in upgrades Environment:Passaic Valley Water Commission seeks 26 million to replace lead lines Gottheimer and others said Trenton needs to step up and address how communities are going to qualify for the 13 million in grants. West Milford Mayor Michele Dale said her town is too strapped for cash to put more money toward the state owned half of Greenwood Lake. Meanwhile, the bi state Greenwood Lake Commission tasked to steward the lake has no permanent funding source, said co chairman Paul Zarrillo. A state bill that received unanimous bipartisan support in the last legislative session would have provided 500,000 to the commission from New Jersey boat registration fees each year. The bill was unconditionally vetoed this month by Gov. Phil Murphy, however. Zarrillo said the commission must once again ask its border counties and municipalities, such as West Milford, for more money just to participate in the 13 million grant initiative. We need direct funding here, Dale said. ""We don't have matching funds. "" Algae blooms in New Jersey Unlike most of the 35 lakes, ponds, reservoirs and rivers where the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection confirmed harmful algae blooms in 2019, Greenwood Lake and Lake Hopatcong have marinas and restaurants that rely on boating and lake recreation to bring customers each summer. Chris Leahy, the owner of Sportsmans Marina on Lakeside Road, said the algae bloom ruined his summer. Announced in mid July, the state imposed no swimming advisory and the resulting warnings about contacting the lake s water all but ended walk up business, he said. The blooms can be the difference between running at a profit or a loss, Leahy said. We have to prevent another summer like last one, Gottheimer said. It s too late if it s warm. To assist with Greenwood Lake, Gottheimer and New Jersey State Assemblywoman BettyLou DeCroce said they are working to draft in legislators from New York. In his veto of the 500,000 lake maintenance fund, Murphy said he wanted to see New York State make a similar financial contribution toward projects such as weed removal, de sliting and algae control. New Jersey officials observed what they believed were similar levels of cyanobacteria on the New York side of the lake during their flyovers this past summer, records show. State officials in New York never confirmed a harmful algae bloom in the north end of the lake in 2019, however. The 1,920 acre lake drains from a dam in the New Jersey end to feed the Monksville and Wanaque reservoirs. The reservoirs supply millions of state residents with water each day.

Mangelsen, at the opening reception Thomas D. Mangelsen A Life in the Wild. Produced by David J. Wagner, LLC, the exhibition features 40 arresting photographs from a body of work amassed over four decades traveling to the wildest corners of North America, Africa and beyond. Thomas D. Mangelsen: A Life in the Wild will be on view in the Stamford Museum s Bendel Galleries through March 15, 2020. Gallery hours are Monday through Friday from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. , and 11 a. m. to 5 p. m. on Sundays. Mangelsen has become legendary for a body of work that includes some of the most recognizable landscape and wildlife scenes ever photographed. Recently featured in an in depth interview on CBS s 60 Minutes, he has been praised by many as a spiritual descendant of Ansel Adams, Eliot Porter, and Edward Weston. Each image in Mangelsen s portfolio has been taken in the wild under natural conditions the result of waiting for the picture perfect moment across decades, and often in hostile conditions, said Jillian Casey, Curator of Collections Exhibitions for the Stamford Museum Nature Center. Such a body of work can only be achieved by having a heightened sense of animal behavior, an uncanny ability to read the environment, and work with such patience.

Scofieldtown,"Year in review: Coronavirus, Dulos, protests, shootings dominated Stamford news STAMFORD A landmark presidential election and yet another reckoning with the country s racial history notwithstanding, 2020 will first and foremost be known as the year of the COVID 19 pandemic. In Connecticut, that was as true for Stamford as anywhere. For part of the spring, Stamford was the epicenter of the disease in the state, seeing more new cases per day than any other municipality. In April, the Connecticut National Guard and U. S. Army Reserve arrived in the city to help with the caseload at Stamford Hospital and repurpose a building on its grounds to help meet extra demand. Restaurants in the city were shuttered, as were many non essential businesses. In an effort to help local eateries, an outdoor dining campaign called Streateries was launched by the Downtown Special Services District over the summer. The city budget was also slashed by 32 million due to the economic effects of the virus. That included about 12 million from the schools budget. Stamford schools shifted to a full remote learning model in March, and returned to partial in school teaching in September. As cases of COVID 19 started to rise again after Thanksgiving, the district decided to go back to full distance learning until Jan. 19. As 2021 begins, vaccine distribution promises to be the story of the year. In Connecticut, the rate of vaccination so far has outpaced New York, but the disease s positivity rate remains high. Dulos saga The year began with new developments in what had been one of the biggest local and state stories of 2019. In January, Farmington resident Fotis Dulos was charged with the murder of his wife Jennifer who was reported missing to New Canaan police where she lived with the couple s five children on May 24, 2019. A few weeks after the arrest, the 52 year old Dulos was found unresponsive in a vehicle in the garage of his home. He was flown to New York in critical condition, and put on life support while suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. Fotis Dulos died on Thursday, Jan. 30. Jennifer Dulos body has yet to be recovered. Michelle Troconis, ex girlfriend of Fotis Dulos, and Kent Mawhinney, his former attorney, have pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Their cases remain ongoing. Racial justice protests This summer was marked by protests against police brutality in cities across the nation. Again, Stamford was among them. Nationwide, protests erupted after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis in May. In Stamford, a number of demonstrations, under the banner of Black Lives Matter and others, took place. In July, a contingent of demonstrators calling themselves Justice for Steven Barrier set up an encampment in Latham Park to protest the death of the Stamford resident, who died in police custody in October of 2019. Some of the people involved in that effort also took part in a campaign to remove a statue of Christopher Columbus from Stamford s downtown Columbus Park. Police eventually ordered protesters to leave Latham Park or be arrested. The Columbus debate, which resulted in dueling rallies, has since quieted down, as city officials stated they would wait until 2021 to address it. But tension between the Latham Park activists and police reached a boiling point in August, when a long protest led to altercations on Broad Street. An internal affairs investigation was completed and the results are to be presented to the Stamford Police Commission at its next meeting scheduled for Jan. 4. Shootings on the rise Stamford has garnered a reputation for being one of the safest cities in America in recent years, but 2020 saw many shootings reported across the city. The increase in gun violence led to a rally in December, with community leaders speaking out against the spate of shootings, many of which are believed to be the result of hostilities between neighborhood factions in the city. Several people have been shot. And on Sept. 20, Shernetta Dunmore, a Stamford mother, was shot and killed when a gunman or gunmen fired on people gathered in a parking lot on Ursula Place. Two others were wounded in the shooting. Police days later arrested Ian Evans in relation to one of the men wounded at the party. He was charged with first degree assault, criminal use of a firearm and other offenses. To date no arrest has been made in Dunmore s death. In early December, a Stamford Hospital worker was shot while driving home from work after he was struck by a stray bullet from a shootout on West Broad Street. The 56 year old hospital employee was admitted to the hospital but his wound was not life threatening. Police have made an arrest in relation to that incident. Gunfire has occurred in various parts of the city, from Connecticut Avenue on the West Side to Pequot Drive in Waterside and Lockwood Avenue on the East Side to Hope Street in Glenbrook. In November, two shootings in neighborhoods near Westover Magnet Elementary School terrified parents, staff and students, causing lockdowns at the school and leading to a virtual meeting hosted by the school principal and police department staff. Police officers implored residents to quickly report any acts of violence to help get guns off the streets. The Gun and Crime Stoppers program allows people to report crimes anonymously, and offers rewards for tips that lead to arrests. The hotline can be reached at 203 977 TIPS. People can also text the keyword Tips2SPD and a tip to CRIMES (274 637), or go to www. StamfordPD. org/Tips. School closes Enrollment and deficit problems led to the closure of the 60 year old Trinity Catholic High School this year. By February, school officials received word that only 19 freshman students had committed to the school for the 2020 21 school year, well below expectations. Projected enrollment for next year was up to 110 students, while enrollment for the 2018 19 school year was 295 students. Closing Trinity broke my heart, said Bishop Frank J. Caggiano. In the past, the diocese had to pick up the cost of operation, mostly payroll and healthcare expenses. This year s budget deficit was expected to be 1.3 million, and would have catapulted to 2.3 million next year based on the reduced enrollment of roughly 100 students. The building, however, won t be vacant for long. In November, Mater Salvatoris, operated by the Spain based Sisters of the Company of the Savior, purchased the property, and will begin teaching there in September. Currently, Mater Salvatoris operates an all girls college preparatory school of about 49 students from pre K to fourth grade in a building on Scofieldtown Road. It opened in 2018 and is one of only seven schools in the world founded by the Sisters of the Company of the Savior, and the only one in the continental United States. ignacio. laguarda stamfordadvocate. com"
OCDChinatown,"Hari Nef on the art of Nash Glynn Nash Glynn, Self Portrait with One Foot Forward and One Hand Reaching Out, 2020, acrylic on canvas, 48 36"". NASH GLYNN IS NUDE. Her body is pink and toned, perched in contrapposto at the edge of a classic American landscape. She s a colossus. There s green at her feet definitely grass, some pines maybe, a smear of amber near the horizon. The landscape submits to the Yves Klein blue of a sky she s turning toward, collapsing longitude and altitude in the lean of her hip. Clouds bloom around and above her they re mauve, like the ones at sunset over a beach town. Except there s no sun in the sky, no source of pink to crush purple in a white cloud. In the absence of sun, there is Nash Glynn, her body turning away. But her head is turned toward me. She looks down at me. She extends her hand. Or maybe she s pointing. Just visible on the horizon is a rainbow. Is that a rainbow? I ask, wrenching myself away from the four foot tall canvas. I m standing in the artist s home studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Glynn looks like me pale, brunette, angular and she sounds like me too (our voices hover between a fey tenor and a husky alto). We re both Jewish and trans, and I m a little terrified of her, as I am of all other trans women I don t know personally. Trans strangers begin with a silent bond, forged in the anguish of gender dysphoria. Greeting her sibling with a closed smile, the transsexual wonders how the other lived through it. She wonders how they both did. Nash Glynn, In the Studio, 2019, acrylic on canvas, 30 20"". That s a rainbow, Glynn tells me. It s present, but distant. I peer at the rainbow, which I might have missed if my eyes hadn t been trained to find it. Rainbow are the boxes of Pride junk I get sent in the mail every June by fast fashion brands gunning for free promotion. Rainbow are the flags hung high on the Fire Island promenade from which I sailed just hours before meeting Glynn. It was she who picked me and our friend Johnny up from Nassau Station, where we had arrived on the LIRR from Sayville. Touch , I say. A gay pride flag subsumed by a trans pride flag. We share a silence, then Glynn makes a funny sound and shakes her head. Pink, white, and blue, I sing, waving my finger, first at her and then at her painting. I see you! Nash Glynn, Study of a Cis White Man (John), 2019, acrylic on canvas, 24 24"". The trans pride flag, designed by activist Monica Helms in 1999, means, but has not aged, well. Two blue stripes for boys sandwich a pink pair for girls which enfold a single white stripe for everyone and everything else. A gender binary quite literally centers whiteness in the trans flag, which is to say that the trans pride flag sells. Last year, 2020, was the first in which my Pride haul pivoted, in large part, from rainbows to pinks whites and blues. Vague gestures of trans pride, I discovered, rankle me more deeply than those of gay pride. The former persist in their sale of themselves to me, apparently as personal, but what could be less personal than male and female, neither or both? Glynn rejects trans and cis narratives at once speaking for herself throwing her body like a wrench into the machine of gender politics. I peer at Glynn s white clouds and blue sky and at the artist s pink and perfect body. She has tricked me into awe at the beauty of something I resent: not her body but my own, maybe and certainly the triad of colors the gay establishment has agreed upon to clock it. Gray bubbles from a recent text exchange burst behind my eyes my best friend, Devan, admonishes me for speaking as often as I do about hating my transness: I don t know what to do with a friend making a case to me about not accepting something about themselves that cannot be changed. I smile at Nash. I see you, I purr. Nash smiles back, and I think she knows what I see. Nash Glynn, Automata, 2019, photomontage, 30 24"". In Torrey Peters s just published novel Detransition, Baby (2021), she sketches a trans horizon of scarcity: no jobs, no lovers, no babies, and while a trans woman might have been a muse, no one wanted art in which she spoke for herself. And so, trans women defaulted into a kind of No Futurism. Glynn titled her 2019 solo debut at Participant Inc. The Future Is Fiction : an assembly of photomontage, video performance, sketches, and the realist acrylic paintings that have become her focus. The show s title plays on The Future Is Female, a liberal feminist refrain of the Trump era popularized on slogan tees remade by Rachel Berks from the originals, which were created in the early 1970s for Labyris Books. Glynn flouts Peters by declaring a Future (Glynn s own future?) into existence she does the same to the old new tee, striking biological sex from the record and replacing it with an infinite capacity for narrative. Glynn, in other words, rejects trans and cis narratives at once speaking for herself throwing her body like a wrench into the machine of gender politics. In Automata, 2019, a black and white photomontage from the Participant show, Glynn stands before a mirror, slicing the picture plane. Her torso hovers above her legs, connected by a cyborg s springs and tubes. What else, I chirp, scanning Glynn s studio. She leads me to a canvas downturned in a dusty corner. You ll like this one, I think, she says, revealing another self portrait. Glynn is pink and perfect as ever in this one, but there are no whites or blues to envelop her no landscape green to stand on. She floats in a sinister red expanse: blood, for sure, maybe arterial or, worse, menstrual. Glynn shares the canvas with another figure: a robot straight out of The Jetsons, its head like an emoji. The robot is fucking her from behind. Glynn looks at the viewer me, again! with a mischievous glint in her eye. She welcomes my gaze. Totally my shit! The painting is flamboyantly upsetting: both futuristic and No Futuristic in a way that feels like home to me. Glynn s been trying to get rid of it, she says: It s old. I ve moved on. She shakes her head, smiling, as she turns the painting to the wall. Nash Glynn, Self Portrait with Robot, 2018, acrylic and fake blood on canvas, 24 36"". MY GASP CUTS the room into silence. I was watching the new Lady Gaga video with some friends when an NPR push notification tickled my ass and lit up my phone screen: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had died at the age of eighty seven. I identify the gasp as dramatic and foolish even as it leaves my lungs. (This, of all things, from the girl who has come to tease her friends by calling them liberals. ) The president will fill her seat with a conservative judge, opening the door to a series of hypotheticals that take the air out of, then into, my lungs. My friends and I murmur among ourselves, a physical exercise in not saying something like We re fucked, because those are not the kinds of things we say. I excuse myself and say my goodbyes, flying down the stairs into the first cold night of fall. I beeline south, where Glynn is celebrating ahead of her opening at OCDChinatown. I arrive at the gallery, a cubby on the second floor of an indoor mall with overhead lighting. The mall is empty save for Nash and her well wishers: beautiful queers sitting on the stairs passing around a bottle of wine. Some I know, most I don t. I smile wanly, and Nash hugs me tight (she and I have been texting daily, hanging out weekly). She leads me to the gallery, inhabited by that first painting she d shown me just weeks before. The invitation to the opening announced its title: Self Portrait with One Foot Forward and One Hand Reaching Out. The show is one painting, and only one person is allowed in the gallery at a time. Nash Glynn, Bust, 2020, graphite on paper, 10 14"". I look at my phone, then at Nash. She nods in recognition. I ll leave you to it, she says. I enter the gallery, greeted by an image I hadn t gone a day without thinking about since I first saw it: Nash Glynn is nude. Her body is pink and toned, perched in contrapposto at the edge of a classic American landscape. Just visible on the horizon is a rainbow. Her head is turned toward me, and she looks down at me. She extends her hand no, her hand reaches out. Her left hand reaches out to me. My right hand lurches toward the canvas as I begin to cry. Hari Nef is an actress and writer in New York. "

Wormtown,"Wormtown Brewery plans larger taproom next door, add distillery Matthew Tota Correspondent When Wormtown Brewery s Shrewsbury Street taproom opened on St. Patrick s Day 2015, it carried an aura of coolness and originality that captured the essence the city s first brewery in decades. Sure, the taproom was small but by design. Examining an early drawing of the taproom two years earlier, co founder Ben Roesch and managing partner David Fields had deemed it too large, taking away valuable space for brewing and bottling. We both looked at each other and said, What is that? We don t need that much space for our taproom. We need production space, Fields has said. And we had them shrink our taproom by at least 50 percent, maybe more. It was a decision their future selves having seen how taprooms have transformed the craft beer business would have no doubt vetoed. And while the move in no way hindered Wormtown s rise, Roesch and Fields still regret downplaying the importance of their taproom. Over the past several months, though, they have quietly pushed to rewrite history. And Wormtown is taking over an additional 5,000 square feet of its building to build a new taproom and restaurant. Wormtown has moved into the section of 72 Shrewsbury St. formerly occupied by simjang, the America Korean fusion restaurant. The brewery has a final hearing next month with the city to extend its licenses to cover the new taproom. The space, more than double the size of the brewery s current taproom, comes with a full kitchen and two levels for dining and drinking. We had recognized at Wormtown, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, that, while this was a state of the art taproom six years ago, first of its kind in Worcester County, it needed a facelift, Fields said. Wormtown had been eyeing simjang s space for more than a year. And the chaos created by COVID 19 only reinforced the need to move to a larger taproom. We really realized by the end of the summer, when outdoor dining went away, we had to do something to allow for a bigger, more social distancing friendly space for our guests, Fields said. The taproom s size is hardly what makes it special, however. Wormtown intends to use it to debut a new venture: distilling. The brewery has already applied for a federal license to become a distillery, a process that will take between four to six months. We will be approaching the city of Worcester with the hope of becoming Worcester s first distillery, much like we were Worcester s first brewery, in generations, Fields said. Once it receives its federal license, along with approval from the city, Wormtown hopes to begin making its own line of spirits, offering them first as cocktails in the new taproom. The consumers will ultimately determine how it evolves, Fields said. Really, what we want to do is drink stuff that we make ourselves. We always start by fulfilling our own desires, making and drinking some cool stuff. Our team loves spirits, especially bourbons and whiskeys. Wormtown also expects to use the taproom s kitchen to host pop ups. Fields said a few local restaurants are already excited about the opportunity, especially given the struggles they re facing now with COVID 19. It s an opportunity for them put out a few more meals and help sustain their businesses, during a time where you have to find unique and creative ways to survive, Fields said. Wormtown s new taproom is expected to open late January or early February. The existing taproom, now temporarily closed, will remain open after the move. "

Ann Arbor s small town look fading as downtown reaches toward sky With apartments catering mainly to University of Michigan students, the three towers that have risen around Kurt Berggren s house in the last decade added more than 1,300 beds downtown, part of a housing boom that s dramatically changing Ann Arbor s skyline. More than a dozen high rises have sprouted in the last 16 years, bringing thousands more residents downtown, along with new ground floor retail and restaurant spaces. Before and after views of downtown Ann Arbor s dramatic transformation Downtown Ann Arbor has changed a lot in the last decade, growing taller, denser and more lively.

Ypsilanti Township offers to donate 25 acres to YMCA for new facility Officials took a step toward luring the YMCA to the Ypsilanti Township when the Board of Trustees in December OK d a donation of 25 acres of township owned land to the organization. Trustees unanimously approved a resolution of intent on Dec. 17, to donate the property at 1500 S. Huron Road, also known as the Seaver Farm Property.

Controversial grants for sewer line benefiting former GOP chair clear review A 10 million grant to a rural township northeast of Ann Arbor was held up by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer s administration last year when it was revealed a former Republican political leader would benefit from the funds. But the aid ultimately passed legal review and will be awarded, state officials said. The funds came under scrutiny in January and February 2019 when Bridge Magazine first reported that Salem Township was awarded two 10 million infrastructure grants despite never asking for them. The grants were to develop sewer and water lines to the township s urban services district, land set aside for future residential or commercial development.

Kerrytown,"Treasure Mart, an Ann Arbor staple for 60 years, is up for sale Amid a time of widespread change in Michigan's best known college town, Ann Arbor's staple consignment store, Treasure Mart, has gone up for sale. Treasure Mart is a family owned store that focuses on the trade of small antique items and furniture. It sits on Detroit Street at the heart of the Kerrytown District in Ann Arbor, an area known for its year round farmer's market and eclectic retail shops. The owner, Elaine Johns, announced the news Tuesday via a Facebook post that featured two photos of the blue, mid 19th century building that houses her business. Yesterday was a really, really hard day for me (for us), she wrote. I got up and immediately started sobbing uncontrollably because we had to list Treasure Mart and the property for sale due to my health issues. Johns, who has managed the store since 1995, was diagnosed with ALS in November and realized she wouldn t be able to work for much longer. She and her husband, Carl Johns, decided to put Treasure Mart up for sale to focus on tending for her health. It s not gonna be long before Elaine can t work anymore and her health is going to dictate that, Carl said. If she hadn t gotten sick, we might ve been here another five or six years, but at some point, things have to change. The area has changed much in the 60 years since Elaine's mother, Demaris Cash, opened the store to keep her family afloat following her husband's two heart attacks and her older daughter's diagnosis with muscular dystrophy. According to Carl Johns, friends told Cash that nobody would go to a store in that area, but Treasure Mart has become a fundamental and constant presence for the Kerrytown community. Martha Woolson is a current on call employee of Treasure Mart and has been going to the store since she was a child. She compared its possible demise to that of Detroit's J. L Hudson's. When they tore down Hudson s, it was as if they took the heart out of Detroit,"" she said. ""I am not saying that Treasure Mart will take the heart out of Ann Arbor, but it s not just a brick but more like a little something being taken out. It is going to be a fine city, but it won t be the same city. The Johnses understand how important their store is for the community and are intent on selling Treasure Mart to someone who will respect it. We are hopeful that we will find that person,"" Carl Johns said. ""Unfortunately, the property in Kerrytown right now is worth a whole lot more than businesses. I would hate to see it go away because so many of the older businesses around town are vanishing right now. "" He said a few individuals have expressed interest in acquiring the property and business, but there have not been any formal offers yet. Despite Treasure Mart being one of the few stores of its kind left in Ann Arbor, a common thread ties its story, not only to Hudson's but also to those of other locally owned retail stores in the Kerrytown District. The owner of Motte Bailey Booksellers in Kerrytown, Gene Alloway, also expressed concern because of a trend he has observed in the last few years: local stores closing and paving the way for chain stores and upscale restaurants to take their place. A lot of people sell online. Instead of taking to consignment shops like Treasure Mart, they put it on Craigslist or eBay, Amazon even,"" Alloway said. ""It s just not enough to open your door and have good stuff anymore. More:New express bus will run from Detroit to Ann Arbor More:Horizon Books, a cherished Traverse City bookstore, to close after 58 years Woolson also fears losing individuality and character in the community. She claims the city has been gradually filled with modern and plastic ""stuff. "" But preservation is still of utmost importance for the Johnses, who hope to keep their businesses afloat at all costs. I would hope people don t get the idea that we are gonna close the doors and not be open anymore because that is just not in the cards right now, said Carl. We plan on being open through this whole process. "

Corktown,"Journey Through Western European Flavors at Cork & Gabel For a moment, let s consider the cultural phenomenon of mozzarella sticks. Fresh mozzarella cheese is rolled in a medley of breadcrumbs spiced with traditional Italian seasoning, deep fried, and served with a side of tangy sweet marinara sauce. Though each ingredient it takes to make a proper serving of mozzarella sticks is a fundamental of Italian cuisine, somehow, the dish with its stretchy cheese proportionately as enamoring for mature adults as it is for wide eyed children has become the archetype of the American appetizer. At Cork Gabel, the mozzarella sticks aren t entirely American or Italian. At Cork Gabel, they re hardly mozzarella sticks at all. Here, the Fried Dubliner Cheese is a starter course ushering diners into the German Irish Italian fusion that s to be expected from all of the dishes to follow. Gooey Dubliner cheese wedges are coated in a crisp herb crust and served atop a smear of marinara sauce and garnished with fresh basil, shaved Parmesan, and a fiery splatter of hot honey. The medley of flavors and techniques is a nod to Executive Chef Matthew McGrail s Italian Irish roots, Owner Joe Mifsud s penchant for German food, and the Corktown restaurant s New American approach to traditional dishes native to each culture. Pi g an Aoire is constructed with all of the ingredients of an authentic Irish Shepherd s Pie a piping hot blend of ground beef and lamb, diced carrots, green peas, rice, cheddar cheese, and silky mashed potatoes but fried crisp into spheres the size of meatballs and plated with a puddle of savory brown gravy. For the Italian Caprese, a fall menu item, wedges of mozzarella are served in rows of three with beautifully charred lines from the griddle, sliced cooked tomatoes, and a ring of balsamic reduction drizzle. Varieties of German sausages show up on the Bangers and Brats portion of the menu. A dish featuring kielbasa and sauerkraut made for a comforting entr e on a cool fall day. The skin on the back of sliced links of kielbasa offers the perfect snap, while the meat itself is tender, with just the right amount of grit that makes a good sausage. Golden sauerkraut peppered with bits of green onion is tangy, complementary to the pile of potato salad served on the side. A heavy hand of vinegar that s steeped into chunks of potato is slightly overpowering, but not enough to stop you from eating every last bite. 1 of 8 The restaurant, originally intended to open as a German style biergarten, has an industrial setting that exudes the feel of a cavernous beer hall. Plates are served to wooden tables with wrought iron details, exposed brick, and vaulted wooden ceilings as the backdrop of your dining experience. The space is unassuming, and a lighthearted energy fills the room. Diners at communal tables are unashamed to eyeball their neighbors dishes or probe for menu recommendations and meal reviews. On one night last spring, the high pitch tone of live Irish bagpipes blared throughout the space, played by a bearded man suited in a proper kilt. On another night, a six piece band tuned up its keyboard and guitars for a lively set that brought diners to their feet for an unexpected night of dinner and dancing. And this past fall, the restaurant was preparing to open an outdoor patio, where guests are welcome to continue the party just steps away from Michigan Central Station. The European fusion crystallizes with Cork Gabel s dessert menu. The Mayflower, the namesake of the restaurant s origin as a doughnut shop founded by German immigrants in the 1940s, is a sweet ode to the venue s historic start. Four warm doughnuts rolled in cinnamon sugar are slid onto the tabletop on a dark wooden plank. Dollops of whipped ricotta cream the most decadent part of the dessert divide the pairs of dense, bite size treats, which are more cake like than a bakery style doughnut hole. But the Irish Waffle Bomb steals the show. A thin, fluffy, rich, boozy Guinness infused chocolate waffle is crowned with one scoop of Baileys Irish Cream ice cream impaled with a shard of chocolate. After the last bite, which comes far too soon, you ll likely be inclined to drag your spoon across the plate, chasing every bit of the chocolate covered pretzel dust that is grated over top of the plate, trapping sweet salty bits in a sticky scrawl of Jameson caramel sauce. And while it may never reach the level of cult status of America s beloved mozzarella sticks, the dish is a marvel in cultural fusion deserving of acclaim in its own right.

Smoke Show Seated at a communal table at Cork Gabel, my dinner guest perked up at the sight of an item being served to a diner sitting at the table behind me. It wasn t a dish that commanded his attention and that of the various other diners craning to catch a glimpse of the elaborate presentation but rather, to my surprise, one of the several cocktails on the restaurant s drink menu. Dubbed the O. F. A. F. , the drink is a unique take on a classic the old fashioned. It s encapsulated in a glass case filled with cherry wood chips and a cloud of smoke. Woodford Double Oaked Bourbon, rich demerara simple syrup, orange oil, and a blend of angostura and black walnut bitters are smoked behind the bar in that case and served tableside. Our waitress explained that in house smoking is one of the chef s prized techniques. On the food menu, you ll find smoked blue cheese made for dipping the saucy Gabel Wings, and applewood smoked bacon appears on the popular Schnitzel BLT. But nowhere is it more pronounced than in the artful O. F. A. F. The over the top cocktail comes at a lavish price of 25 for just one serving. "
Corktown,"In Michigan, legal age to buy cigarettes, vaping devices is now 21 Michigan 18 year olds can vote, buy rifles or register for the military draft, yet they are now too young to legally buy cigarettes or vaping devices. The federal minimum age for purchasing any tobacco products, including e cigarettes, jumped to 21 on Dec. 20, when President Donald Trump signed a 1.4 trillion spending bill that had the tobacco age restriction tucked into it. The new minimum age took effect immediately, which came as a surprise to many retailers who expected some type of transition period. The timing of the rule change shortly before Christmas was also unexpected. There is still confusion among Michigan officials regarding when the new age restriction will start being enforced. Some stores and gas stations still display signs showing 18 as the age for tobacco products. However, some merchants have gone ahead and raised their minimum purchase age to 21 to avoid any potential trouble with authorities. ""A lot of people are aware of it and angry,"" said Hamze Ezzeddine, a manager at a Shell station on Woodward Avenue in Midtown Detroit that is near Wayne State University. Ezzedine sells a lot of cigarettes and sees many young customers who are students. A spokeswoman for the Michigan Attorney General's Office said Thursday their office is awaiting further guidance about the new regulation from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's tobacco division. The FDA did not respond to a Free Press request for comment, but its website says the law is now in effect. The Michigan Retailers Association has recommended that its members begin following the new federal rule and stop selling tobacco products, including e cigarettes, to those under 21, said Amy Drumm, the association's vice president of government affairs. The association is waiting to learn whether Michigan officials intend to immediately enforce the new rule, Drumm said. ""There is still a lot of confusion,"" she said. A spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health Human Services said that because the new 21 plus federal law is more restrictive than current Michigan law for tobacco sales, no separate amendment or state statute is necessary for enforcement to begin. More:FDA officially raises federal minimum age to purchase all tobacco products from 18 to 21 More:FDA bans mint and fruit flavored vaping products but exempts menthol and tobacco Fruity vape pods ban There are more federal regulations for smokers on the horizon. The FDA said Thursday that it will soon ban fruit and mint flavored pod products used in e cigarettes, while allowing vape shops to still sell flavors from tank based systems, which let people mix their own vaping juice. The pods are considered more convenient. The ban, aimed at curtailing youth vaping, will take effect in 30 days and will not apply to menthol and tobacco flavored products. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned flavored vapes earlier this year but that was put on hold this fall by a court injunction. Bring an ID Nathan Esquivel, owner of the Corktown Smoke Shop in Detroit, said he stopped selling any cigarettes or vaping products to 18 , 19 and 20 year olds as soon as he heard about the new federal 21 plus rule. Now everyone needs to be ID d if they look under 30, he said. Esquivel said his shop doesn't attract many young smokers, so he has not had to turn anyone away. ""They ve all been 21 so far,"" he said. ""I had a person call just to see, and it sounded like he already knew about the law, but he wanted to see if we didn t know about it. He was like Do I need to bring anything?' And we re like, 'An ID. You have to be 21. ' And he s like Oh, really? Esquivel said the coming federal ban on fruity vaping pods will have a bigger impact on his business. Roughly 80% of his vaping sales are for fruit flavored products, he said. Some of the flavors he had on display were frozen mango, pi a colada and cr me br l e. Most of our people are 21 and up, but they still like the fruity vape,"" he said. ""They re going to have to switch over to menthol or tobacco. "" Jamal Saad, manager of the Wayne Party Store on Cass Avenue, directly across from Wayne State, said he anticipates some unhappy customers when students return to campus Monday and discover that he is enforcing the 21 plus rule for vaping products. Most of his student age customers buy vaping products, rather than cigarettes, he said. Wayne State has a ban against any smoking or e cigarette use on campus. ""It s going to affect the business,"" he said. ""This means a person who's 20 now and been smoking for one year, he s going to buy cigarettes he can t.

Corktown,"On this day in Detroit history: Final train departs Michigan Central Station Michigan Central Station served as a bustling transportation hub in Detroit until it closed in 1988. (Photo courtesy of Ford) DETROIT After a decline in train travel, the last train left Michigan Central Station on Jan. 5, 1988. Michigan Central served as a transportation hub in Detroit for 75 years. It opened earlier than planned on Dec. 26, 1913, after a fire at the old depot at Third and Jefferson avenues rendered that station inoperable. It was once bustling and booming, but that would change. The concourse at Michigan Central Station before the train depot shuttered. The main waiting room was closed in April of 1967. Amtrak would later take over the station in 1971, reopen the waiting room and pour more than 1 million into renovating MCS. This renovation included the addition of a bus terminal. However, those improvements weren t enough to save the station. As the Chicago bound train left MCS in 1988, the depot would begin a fall into decay and vandalism. Ad The video below is a segment from 1991, as the station started its descent toward decay. Vacancy and decay Over the next three decades, plans for the station would continually fall through. Real estate developer Mark Longton Jr. purchased the building in 1989 with plans to open a casino, however the plan never materialized. In 1996, Controlled Terminals Inc. , a company owned by Manuel Moroun, bought the station. MORE: A brief history of Michigan Central Station Since Moroun acquired the building, several ideas have been proposed for MCS, including a trade processing center, a casino, a new Detroit Police headquarters and a new Michigan State Police headquarters, but the space has remained empty. As the hulking structure stood unoccupied, it attracted both negative and positive attention. It became a place for vandals, homeless people and urban explorers. The inside and outside of the building were canvases for graffiti and the hundreds of windows were smashed. Scrappers also did a number on the station, stealing much of its wiring and plumbing. Ad The elements also took its toll, evident by the puddles pooling inside the building. Inside Michigan Central Station in July 2017 (Amber Ainsworth/WDIV) In the past few years, renovations have given the station a facelift. Security was ramped up as work started. New windows were installed in 2015, as well as an elevator that is able to transport heavy construction materials and machinery to the top floors. In 2018, 30 years after the station shuttered, new hope was announced. Ford shares plans for MCS Ford Motor Co. announced it had purchased the train station in the summer of 2018. Since then, the automaker has been pouring money into the depot, with intentions of moving its autonomous vehicle team into the building as part of a development that will include other buildings. Ad Ford is planning on creating a campus that will consist of about 1.2 million square feet of property in Corktown. The mixed use space will feature office space, retail space and residential housing. While efforts are underway to revitalize the building, Ford has said it plans to try to restore the depot to its former glory. It has turned to artifacts that were stolen and returned for inspiration, and it said original limestone will be used. "
Corktown,"Gold Cash Gold restaurant in Corktown to close Gold Cash Gold, a 5 year old Corktown restaurant in an old pawn shop on the Detroit neighborhood's main drag, is set to close around Feb. 2. The Southern influenced American restaurant's chef partner Brendon Edwards disclosed the news in an email obtained by Crain's. The business will be up for sale, as well, according to co owner Phil Cooley, also of nearby Corktown staple Slows Bar BQ. Restaurant ownership declined to disclose the asking sale price. They plan to keep ownership of the renovated building at 2100 Michigan Ave. Edwards' email listed Feb. 2 as Gold Cash Gold's last day in business. But Cooley said sale details could affect the target date. Edwards cited a variety of reasons for the closure. He said business is slow in Corktown during the week, and in an increasingly populated restaurant market, diners are often driven to buzzy new places. "". we have battled with keeping weekday business which often is a hindrance to our bottom line,"" Edwards wrote in the email sent Friday evening. The end of the year was less profitable than expected, he wrote, and Gold Cash Gold faces a January without the extra business drummed up by the North American International Auto Show downtown. The event moved to June as of this year. Edwards and Cooley also spoke to Corktown's slower growth compared with other areas in the greater downtown. Downtown and Midtown have the foot traffic, but Corktown doesn't yet, Cooley said. He expressed optimism, though, with Ford Motor Co. 's renovation of Michigan Central Station underway as the centerpiece of a mobility focused satellite campus. Gold Cash Gold opened in late 2014. Its ownership includes brothers Phil and Ryan Cooley, as well as their father, Ron Cooley, and Toby Barlow and Brian Boyle. Phil Cooley said they plan to sell Gold Cash Gold's assets including liquor license and equipment as a turnkey restaurant to another owner who is at the time in their career where they want the challenge. Gold Cash Gold, in the crowded fine dining sector, was not profitable. But Cooley said he has ""nothing but tremendous respect"" for the staff, chef and leadership. There are no plans to sell Slows, Cooley said. There could be pop ups after the closure, and Gold Cash Gold plans to honor event bookings, Cooley said. Edwards wrote there could be future opportunities for staff, and that he would help those who want assistance finding other jobs. "". My heart is nothing but sad about this,"" Edwards wrote in the email. "". the goal I have had since day one here is to continue to grow and push and educate all who comes through our doors.

Corktown,"Gold Cash Gold in Detroit's Corktown to close Feb. 2 Having a restaurant with automaker Ford Motor Company in your neighborhood could appear to be a gold rush. But Gold Cash Gold, Corktown s 70 seat eatery, located in a former pawn shop, is closing. Brendon Edwards, the chef at the helm of Gold Cash Gold, and his partner said brunch on Feb. 2 will be its final service. Edwards cited several factors in the decision to shutter. There is definitely some market saturation, he said. ""Corktown has not seen a population increase at the rate as downtown or Midtown. We import our customers, they drive from all over and there a lot of other restaurants. Another contributing factor, Edwards said, was the North American International Auto Show moving to June. Edwards said a large portion of its sales came in the first quarter and was based on the auto show. More:The latest in a string of closures, Royal Oak's Bistro 82 to shutter Jan. 25 More:Detroit's big restaurant stories in 2019 and what to look forward to in 2020 Between buys from actual automakers, Toyota and Hyundai supported us for a number of years, as well as some private parties and large parties of executives coming in, they all contributed to a good amount of our sales for the first quarter. "" Gold Cash Gold was open during the week for dinner and served brunch on Saturday and Sunday. Our brunch has been wildly successful and on Father s Day we served 350 in a 70 seat restaurant, Edwards said. Trying to keep up on the weekdays has been more of a struggle. Edwards indicated that after the closure, they are still looking at doing some pop ups and special events in the restaurant space. Edwards, 36, has been at the helm of the restaurant since late fall 2016 when the menu reflected many southern influences. Coming on board at Gold Cash Gold, Edwards said, he didn t want to be restricted to that cuisine, being so close to Slows Bar BQ. New American became the buzz words for describing the menu Edwards said it's a nod to letting you know you might be familiar with it. I wanted to diversify the cuisines within the neighborhood, Edwards said. Most recently the menu reflected Latin American and Spanish influences. Edwards' career has taken him to Michelin star restaurants in Chicago. And locally, his name has been part of the Detroit restaurant scene with stints at the Antietam, which closed in 2018, and Standby in downtown Detroit. The restaurant opened in December 2014. It was quickly named to late Free Press restaurant critic Sylvia Rector s Top 10 Best New Restaurant list for 2015. Its menu was noted as having southern influences. Gold Cash Gold is known for its pickle brined chicken and focus on farm to table fare, partnering with the likes of Guernsey Dairy, Wasem Fruit Farm and Stone Hedge Farm. The Corktown area has evolved into one of Detroit s trendiest neighborhoods. And Ford s investment in the area, including the redevelopment of Michigan Central Station, has given it a bigger boost. Gold Cash Gold is located nearly across the street from the train station. Real estate in the area has boomed. New condos and townhouses located just blocks away, on the site where Tiger Stadium used to stand, start around 400,000. More:Things are still raw inside Michigan Central Station but progress is happening I think that it s a really unfortunate thing to have to happen, Edwards said. But I think the entire staff as well as myself are proud of what we've done. We supported a lot of local farms. We started a lot programs we are proud of and . turning it from a restaurant that was at a bit of a loss to one of positive growth since I ve been here.

Corktown,"Detroit's RoboCop statue, a magnificent obsession for 9 years now, is nearly done New decade, new RoboCop statue update. The work of art that began as an offbeat idea back in 2011 is now almost finished, according to one of the men who launched its crowdfunding campaign. ""The casting is completely done. All that is left is applying the patina and welding the large sections together,"" said Brandon Walley of the Imagination Station via email in a status update on the nine years and counting project. According to Walley, the crew at Detroit's Venus Bronze Works should have the statue finished and ready to leave the shop by March. ""We do need to wait until the freeze of winter is over and the ground to thaw to be able to install outside,"" he said. Recent photos were posted in late December on the project's Kickstarter page by Imagination Station, a community arts nonprofit group based in Corktown. They reveal that once RoboCop's head is welded onto his body, the results are going to be pretty amazing not to mention 11 feet tall. ""He is big, he is clean, he is bronze, he is perfect,"" the posting reads. ""The next time you see him he will be sporting a fully finished dark gray patina. "" In the pictures, you can see approximately what that patina will look like in the portion of the breast plate. Walley, a Detroit filmmaker, and Jerry Paffendorf, co founder of Loveland Technologies started the Imagination Station's grassroots effort to raise money for the RoboCop statue in 2011 and ended up with pledges for more than 67,000. The spark for their campaign was a Twitter message sent to Detroit's then mayor Dave Bing. A Massachusetts man suggested to Bing that the half man, half cyborg police officer from the 1987 sci fi cult hit ""RoboCop"" could serve as a Motor City ambassador, much like the statue of Rocky does in Philadelphia. Bing replied that no plans were underway, but the idea spurred much online attention and began a life of its own. Now the light at the end of the tunnel seems to be here for the monument born with a tweet. ""You will find that the scale and quality of craftsmanship were worth the wait,"" teases the December Kickstarter posting. Giorgio Gikas has been overseeing the process at Venus Bronze Works, one of the leading sculptural restoration and conservation businesses in the nation. Gikas, an art conservation expert, has spent decades restoring iconic local works like the Joe Louis fist, the ""Spirit of Detroit statue and more. Before work even could start, however, there were many legal and technical hurdles to overcome, including obtaining copyright permission and navigating the many complicated mold and model making steps in the lead up to the pouring of the casts. In May 2018, Imagination Station announced that the statue would have a home on the grounds of the Michigan Science Center, which then was under the direction of president and CEO Tonya Matthews. The RoboCop statue is expected to be installed somewhere on the site in the spring or summer of 2020, if it is completed in that time frame, according to Christian Greer, the head of the Michigan Science Center since June 2019. From 2017: RoboCop statue's bronze pieces revealed A veteran of Chicago's Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and, most recently, a chief officer of the Saint Louis Science Center, Greer says that he doesn't want to comment on any specifics until the statue actually is finished. Any details also will need to coordinate with the Michigan Science Center's busy planning schedule, notes Greer. Imagination Station is promising to everyone on Kickstarter that the wait will be worth it: ""This is a once in a lifetime work of art, engineering, and persistence. The hours involved have been innumerable, from craftsmen all over the country to being made in Detroit, this has coalesced into something truly great and truly unique.

Corktown,"Eminem releases surprise album, urges gun reform in video citing Vegas concert massacre Eminem had an unexpected gift for fans early Friday and a stark new video that s sure to spark heated debate. The Detroit rapper released his 11th album, Music to Be Murdered By, a 20 track project with guests such as Ed Sheeran, Juice WRLD, Skylar Grey and longtime hometown compatriot Royce da 5 9. The midnight drop was accompanied by a video for the song Darkness, a six minute saga that unfolds as a grim tale of anxiety and substance abuse before revealing its layered meanings: a glimpse into the mind of the 2017 Las Vegas concert shooter and a metaphor for Eminem s own angst as a stage performer.

(Paddock killed 58 people at the Route 91 Harvest country festival in October 2017, before police found him dead from a self inflicted gunshot. ) Eminem s lines, delivered atop a piano bed by Detroit musician Luis Resto, play off the dual idea of killing in the performance context as the rapper himself is later seen as a lonely artist stepping onstage to wow a stadium packed with fans.

They cite greater downtown s low comparative rent to other big cities (which, although 1,075 is high for most current city residents, and let s just face it, most Metro Detroiters) it s a bargain for New Yorkers and others who are used to paying a lot more for a lot less in square footage. Anecdotally, when I lived in Midtown a couple of years ago, it seemed as almost every new neighbor moving in wasn t from the burbs of Metro Detroit, but San Francisco, Brooklyn, Seattle or something like that. They were working remotely for their old jobs at their coastal salary or recruited by a place like Quicken. From an evening at The Skip Anyway, there are shoutouts to Standby, The Skip, Astro Coffee and Batch Brewing Company. They are all good places. But there s so much more to the city than that.

Corktown,"GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant will build Cruise Origin self-driving shuttle Detroit General Motors Co. on Monday will solidify the importance of Detroit to the future of the auto industry when it confirms the all electric Cruise Origin self driving shuttle will be built at the Detroit Hamtramck Assembly plant. The announcement, first reported by The Detroit News on Friday, is central to GM's strategy of building a zero emissions, zero congestion and zero crashes future with fleets of electric and autonomous vehicles. The Origin, developed by Cruise LLC, the autonomous vehicle unit of GM, was created in partnership with Honda Motor Co. Unveiled in San Francisco on Tuesday, it's a boxy vehicle with no steering wheel or gas pedal that's intended to be used in a ride sharing fleet. It is powered by a new all electric platform built by GM. For the Motor City, GM's decision ""raises the image in terms of being more forward thinking, more high tech and that s a good thing for public perception,"" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader, a Cox Automotive company. GM will invest 2.2 billion for an ""all electric future at the Detroit Hamtramck plant for electric pickups, SUVs and AVs autonomous vehicles ,"" Gerald Johnson, executive vice president of global manufacturing for GM, wrote in a letter to Detroit Hamtramck employees Friday. The investment brings with it 2,200 jobs at a plant targeted for closure before it found new life during tense negotiations over the course of a six week strike by the United Auto Workers union last fall. Electric pickup truck production will begin in late 2021, Johnson noted in the letter. A start date for the Origin hasn't been announced, but it's been reported that in addition to a truck, an electric van will begin rolling down the line in 2021. Glenn Stevens, executive director of MICHauto and the Detroit Regional Chamber s vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives, said it make perfect sense to build the Cruise Origin in Detroit. ""We put the world on wheels,"" he said. ""This is a logical place for a company to design and engineer and build a vehicle that s quite revolutionary. "" The Origin will be delivered globally, but no schedule has been released. Cruise has a fleet of 180 Chevrolet Bolt based Cruise AVs built at the GM Lake Orion plant that it tests on San Francisco streets. In 2019, Cruise drove almost 1 million miles on nearly every road in the city. Still, GM and Cruise last year missed a self imposed deadline to launch the first iteration of an autonomous vehicle for commercial use because more testing was needed. The Cruise Origin has not yet been tested on public streets. ""I think there is going to be quite a bit of work involved before they are ready to deploy,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. Analysts foresee testing of the Origin in San Francisco, where the Cruise team is based. Abuelsamid also expects the company to test in Japan. There's no indication how many Origins will be built, but analysts don't expect it to be built at a high volume, at least not for the first few years. ""It s a forward looking product. I think the question is, what does it mean in terms of volume and jobs?"" Krebs said. The announcement Monday could demystify GM's plans for Detroit Hamtramck, which have been in question for more than a year after GM said it would discontinue the sedans currently built there. The Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac CT6 will hit the end of the line at Detroit Hamtramck in February. The plant will then be idled as it's retooled for an electric lineup that is said to include the return of Hummer vehicles branded under GMC, and possibly an electric GMC Sierra and Cadillac Escalade. Retooling is expected to take 12 to 18 months, according to a chairman's report from UAW Local 22 at the Detroit Hamtramck plant obtained by The News. The assembly line likely will need ""significant reconfiguration"" since the plant is going from installing engines to batteries, Abuelsamid said. A battery pack assembly line is expected to be a part of the revamp. The automaker is expected to air a Super Bowl commercial featuring Lebron James and the first product expected to come out of the plant in late 2021: an electric version of a Hummer truck and SUV. GM purchased the Hummer brand in 1999 and discontinued it in 2010 following its bankruptcy. Earlier this week, GM reached an agreement with Michigan to reduce and cap tax breaks as part of a deal that will require the automaker to invest 3.5 billion in the state in the next 10 years, including at Detroit Hamtramck. Under the agreement announced Wednesday by the Michigan Strategic Fund board, the value of the GM's maximum tax credit over 20 years will be reduced by 325 million to about 2.28 billion. GM's decisions come as Ford Motor Co. spends 740 million to renovate a historic site in Corktown and develop future technologies there. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is spending 2.5 billion to retool two plants in Detroit to build next generation Jeep SUVs and electric vehicles. Additionally, Waymo LLC, the self driving unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. is investing 14 million to outfit vehicles with its autonomous technology at a former American Axle Manufacturing plant in Detroit. khall detroitnews. com Twitter: bykaleahall"

"" Garcia says police told the family the other car a Cadillac has been stolen from Lincoln Park some time ago and was being driven by joyriders at an excessive rate of speed. Detroit Police said an 87 year old man who was in that car was taken to a hospital but died. It is not clear how many others were in that car. Two others may have run off on foot. Only two vehicles were involved. The Rodriguez family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover their funeral expenses. "

Bungtown,"The simple ways bears can easily outwit humans At first, the bears went unseen in the nighttime, like mischievous elves descending from the woods. But instead of mending shoes or spinning straw into gold, they cracked compost bins, tore open beehives, and licked small traces of beef tallow from backyard grills, only to disappear with the first hint of the rising sun. Advertisement Bungtowners residents of Burlingham, Ohio watched uneasily as a series of raids in a century old barn reduced a feral colony of hardy barn cats from a population of 20 to nought. People also began reporting other incidents that didn t quite gibe with how a bear ought to behave. One night in Bungtown, a Vietnam veteran named Dave Thurber, feeling uneasy, tweaked his living room curtain and saw a bear lumbering across his front yard, leaving deep claw marks in the snow. Right off the bat, this was a bit unnatural. During a New England winter, a bear or to be more precise, a normal bear is in the middle of a season long slumber. For five or more months, the bear lies in a den, its heart rate lowered to a somnambulant eight beats per minute it does not eat, drink, defecate, or urinate until the warmth of spring signals the promise of new vegetation to eat. But this bear was far from unconscious. It walked to a tall metal post where Thurber s calorie laden bird feeder perched out of reach. Making short work of the post, the bear easily brought the payload of seeds earthward, then cracked open the feeder s plastic hull. Read more about bears: As the bear began to eat, a car bumped up the rutted dirt road, high beams sliding across the lawn like prison searchlights scanning a jail yard for escaping convicts. And indeed, Thurber saw that the bear acted like a convict, deftly avoiding the light streams by flattening itself just beyond their reach, in the shadowed lee of a large snowbank. As soon as the lights swept on, the bear reclaimed the bird feeder, delicately licked up the remaining seeds, and walked toward the nearest neighbour perhaps the cat barn to see what might be on offer there. Thurber s experience with the bear was surprising, because the bear wasn t simply seeking cover when humans approached. Rather, it seemed to be specifically avoiding the light. Which suggested that the bear knew human passersby could only see where the light struck. Which further suggested that the bear had the mental capacity to understand the physical properties of his surroundings, as they would appear to a human, and act accordingly and under our common human understanding of animal intelligence, that would make this particular animal some sort of bear genius. In a sense, evolution grants every living thing a brilliant talent for squeezing life from its surroundings the more extreme the habitat, the greater the savant. Frogs, for example: The panamanian golden frog, which cannot make itself heard above the roaring waterfalls of Panama, attracts mates through the use of semaphore. New England s Eastern Gray Tree Frog, on the other hand, can survive being frozen nearly solid all winter its organs sit like tiny hunks of beef jerky in an icy slurry of body fluids. But these sorts of biological precocity are the domain of specialists. Against this backdrop, some living things exhibit an even greater level of genius, having evolved the grey matter needed to unlock a wide array of habitats. Humans are one of these problem solving species. Bears are another. Read more about bears: Bears have so many physical gifts that it s hard to imagine why they would need to problem solve at all. Their large, padded feet carry them over swampland like rugged boots each boot terminates in five blunt, pocketknife sized claws that can tear open stumps and burrows or climb trees to access beechnuts on the branch. With their enormous strength (they can bend a car door in half) and size (hunters have killed quarter ton black bears in New Hampshire the national weight record is 402kg), they can prey opportunistically on a wide variety of smaller creatures, including young deer and moose. Outside of human hunters, the only things that eat bears are larger bears (though researchers are at a loss to fully understand the reasons behind black bear cannibalism). Bears have sharper eyesight than people (with night vision to boot), ears that are twice as sensitive, and noses capable of scenting a carcass twenty miles distant (seven times better than a bloodhound). If escaping a bear s notice is unlikely, so is escaping the bear itself. Humans can dive into water to flee cougars, climb trees to evade raging rhinoceri, and outrun alligators. But the average black bear swims speedily and climbs quickly. It could spot Usain Bolt 25 meters in his world record setting 100 meter dash and still pounce on the world s fastest man well before the finish line. To be clear, bear attacks are very rare. From a statistical standpoint, you re more likely to suffocate in a giant vat of corn than be injured by a bear. But modern attacks do happen, with seriously not good outcomes. Cynthia Dusel Bacon, by all accounts a rugged 31 year old geologist, was conducting a land survey in the Alaskan bush in 1977 when she saw an aggressive black bear beelining toward her. Dusel Bacon waved her arms and shouted, right up until the moment the bear knocked her down, after which she decided to play dead so the bear wouldn t see her as a threat. That was a consequential error in judgment, experts said afterward, because the 77kg bear likely never saw her as a threat. It was just hungry. When she stopped resisting, it dragged her into the trees and began to eat her alive. Even as some parts of her body disappeared down the throat of the bear, other parts of her body, quite heroically, accessed a communication device and alerted a partner in the area as to her emergency. Other geologists arrived in a helicopter and scared the bear off in time to save her life. The never say die Dusel Bacon went on to post instructional YouTube videos in which she demonstrates how to chop carrots, wash dishes, and get dressed with two prosthetic arms. For the residents of Grafton, whose homes were being probed with frightening regularity by a resurgent bear population, ursine intelligence levels were a key factor in a question most people never have to ask: how close am I to a bear right now? After all, it s one thing to be appropriately respectful of a creature s brute force. It s quite another to live alongside one sly enough to case your home with the cool calculation of a professional burglar. Graftonites weren t the first ones to concern themselves with bear IQs. Those who suspected high level thinking in Grafton s bears had a rogue scientist champion Ben Kilham, one of the foremost bear experts in the world. Kilham (featured as the bear whisperer in a panda bear documentary narrated by actress Kristen Bell) employs many of the controversial methods employed, famously, by the primatologist Jane Goodall. He names the bears he studies, attributes emotional motivations to their behaviour, and probably wouldn t have to work too hard to get a nod from Guinness as the world record holder for enduring the highest number of nonfatal bear bites. When Kilham is not living in the woods alongside wild bears, he sleeps in his human home, which is not 4km from Grafton. Many Graftonites, including John Babiarz, referred me to Kilham, and so I called to find out whether bears are indeed smart enough to avoid the light of a passing car, surveil farmsteads, snatch cats, and do many of the other things reported in Grafton that struck me as improbable. Kilham (who also happens to be a former gun designer) answered a few of my questions and then said that, if I really wanted to learn more about bear psychology, I should buy a book that gets into the nuances. He recommended one in particular, titled In the Company of Bears, available in paperback from Amazon. The book was written by Ben Kilham. Kilham has seen more of the inner workings of bear life than anyone. In the book, his vivid description of their intricate society suggests that bears are even smarter than sign language savvy apes. Kilham credits bears with self awareness, the ability to count to twelve (primates can only manage a three count), and cooperation to enforce a bear justice system. He says they can remember the distant past, mull over the likelihood of events in the distant future, and communicate and empathize with one another. One resource strapped female bear can even, he says, engage in the incredibly complex negotiation of asking another, better off female to adopt her cub. Advertisement After reading Kilham s books and other research, I was thoroughly convinced that bears are smart enough to employ high level reasoning in their efforts to plunder calories from humans. But brains alone didn t explain some of the behaviours I was hearing about. "
Quarrytown,"Berea Community Outreach anchors city’s help to residents: Community Voices BEREA, Ohio With the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic in March 2020, Berea Community Outreach became the go to resource for increasing numbers of Berea residents. BCO was one of the first projects started by Mayor Cyril Kleem when he took office in 2008. He saw it as reaching out to those in the shadows of the community, the ones that are often forgotten, he said. Living up to its motto lending a hand, making a difference Berea Community Outreach now encompasses a long list of programs, from a food pantry and Dinner to Your Door to grass cutting and snowplowing for seniors and the disabled. Natalie Guzzo, Berea Community Outreach coordinator, said requests for services have mushroomed in the past year. At the same time, we ve been getting a tremendous amount of donations since COVID, she said. When the first stimulus checks were mailed, many residents dropped off the funds at BCO. They told me they didn t need the money. We could put it to better use, Guzzo said. Local corporations have helped, too. Giant Eagle has donated bakery, food, soap, toilet paper and other supplies worth more than 30,000. Guzzo said the grocery store also gave BCO clients Halloween bags and decorations. Heinen s regularly drops off bread and bakery items worth more than 10,000 over the year. One of BCO s major programs is the Backpack Program for students at Grindstone Elementary School and Berea Midpark High School who might need nutritious food over the weekend. Credit First National Association, based in Brook Park, has donated all of the food items for the Backpack Program. The association also gave 10,000 for Christmas gifts and school supplies for BCO clients. The Backpack Program serves 55 students. School supplies were given to 65 students. Individuals, service organizations such as Berea Kiwanis and Berea Rotary, churches, school groups and other non profits donate cash, time and talent to make sure programs run smoothly. Dinner to Your Door delivers hot meals to 42 seniors, shut ins and disabled residents in Berea, Brook Park and Middleburg Heights. The meals are provided by a catering service and delivered by volunteers. About 180 families are served by the Food Pantry, which is open every Thursday. Easter and Thanksgiving meals were delivered to 100 residents at Quarrytown. Children were given Easter baskets. For Christmas, 110 children received gifts through BCO. BCO volunteers raked leaves for 75 seniors in November. BCO also supports the Active Senior Network and the Veterans Outreach Office. BCO works with the police department and other agencies to help those with mental health issues and those who may need housing assistance. All of this is accomplished as a non profit. BCO has raised more than 800,000 in cash and donations to support its programs. Program costs are supported 100 percent by donations. No tax dollars are used. BCO relies on the generosity of the community to continue helping our neighbors. Berea is such a great community because of our sense of family, and it s that sense of family that we rely on to support Berea Community Outreach, Kleem said. To support Berea Community Outreach, make checks payable to BCO and mail to 535 Wyleswood Drive, Berea, OH 44017. You also can donate on the city website, https://cityofberea. org/274/Berea Community Outreach. Non perishable food items can be dropped off weekdays between 9 a. m. and 4 p. m. It s best to call first, at 440 826 4891. BCO is headquartered at the former Smith School, 535 Wyleswood Drive. "

Overtown,"How the Legal System Left Artist Purvis Young’s Beneficiaries Empty-Handed An article published in the Washington Post Magazine dives deep into the ill fated battle over works by the beloved Miami artist Purvis Young left behind after his death in 2010. The piece describes how a group of attorneys, claiming the artist did not have a market, were able to sidestep a proper appraisal of his estate and keep the works for themselves ultimately leaving Young s beneficiaries disinherited and revealing troubling aspects of Florida s laws that are supposed to protect the vulnerable. While Young s work resides in major institutions across the United States, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, during his lifetime the artist was known for flooding the city itself with his art, putting up works in public spaces as in his famous Goodbread Alley murals (1972). Young was born in Liberty City and came up in Overtown, both historically Black neighborhoods in Miami. After serving a prison sentence for burglary, he began painting on any surface he could get his hands on, from spare scraps of wood and cardboard to discarded cabinet doors. His lush works distill the most pressing issues of Young s community, including drug abuse, displacement, and mass incarceration, into vivid landscapes of color populated by beautifully expressive, abstracted figures. The Miami based collectors Don and Mera Rubell acquired the contents of his studio in 1999, but Young would be active and prolific for another decade. According to the Post, he named as the main beneficiaries of his will Eddie Mae Lovest, one of his closest friends, and 12 of her daughters and grandchildren. Though his assets were modest, they included 1,884 of his works. Lovest expected the works would be sold and her family would receive the proceeds, but instead, she was appalled to discover a judge had released all the works to a group of lawyers to fulfill pending debts, leaving her family empty handed. In the final years of Young s life, Miami Dade probate court judge Maria Korvick determined he required guardianship, an arrangement in which a surrogate is appointed to handle the affairs of vulnerable adults suffering from mental or physical disabilities and make decisions on their behalf. Martin Siskind, one of Young s dealers, had suggested the artist qualified for guardianship. Previously, Young had sued Siskind for paying him inadequately and refusing to report on his art sales, among other allegations. Per Korvick s ruling, lawyer David Mangiero was appointed Young s guardian of the property and would oversee his finances. The cost of the guardianship (which Young always insisted he did not need), as well as lawyer fees he had accrued over time, amounted to around half a million dollars in debt by the time of his death. Despite growing institutional and commercial attention to Young s works, Mangiero gave the works left by Young an estimated fair market value (FMV) of 1 each. Mangiero also bumped the guardians and lawyers to the top of the list of creditors to be paid, above Young s heirs, and asked that they be paid in artwork and eventually proposed that they choose pieces worth twice the amount they were owed to offset dealer commissions should they place the work with a gallery, reports the Post. Yet Mangiero never sought a formal appraisal of the works, claiming it would cost tens of thousands of dollars, and instead held on to them for years. Leon Rolle, a friend of Young s and former practicing lawyer, helped Mangiero facilitate a few sales and kept the Lovests apprised of any offers. They still expected that Mangiero would eventually find a buyer and the art would sell for millions, says the article. But in early 2018, Rolle received an e mail from a gallerist who said he had acquired Young s estate. Courthouse records confirmed Korvick had waived the appraisal requirement and agreed to let Mangiero take the artworks to as pay, reasoning that there was no market for Young s art and that Mangiero had done all in his power to find buyers without success. Seven of the eight attorneys and guardians divided up the works among themselves, and in late 2017, Mangiero along with three other lawyers sold around 1,000 works to art collector and financial adviser Alan Bluestein. According to the Post, auction records for Young include sales of works for upwards of 20,000 and up to 42,500, and the article cites the New York based dealer James Fuentes as saying he has sold paintings for around 35,000. Bluestein himself has not sold the works he acquired, believing their value will increase. For a multitude of reasons, prices for Young s works have been known to fluctuate, with many selling at significant fractions of these figures. Still, the numbers seem to show that the claim of a lack of market for Young s oeuvre was unfounded, or at least foolhardy. Beyond the legal loopholes the case elucidates, the system that dispossessed Young s heirs is a cautionary tale about the art world s many opacities and ambiguities, and how they send shock waves through the lives of people outside of it.

Overtown,"National Gallery of Art Acquires 40 Works from Souls Grown Deep; Living Artists Benefit From A... Joe Light, Birdman Trainer, 1987. Enamel on wood paneling. Estate of Joe Light / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York. Photo: Stephen Pitkin/Pitkin Studio Through the latest gift purchase agreement of Souls Grown Deep s Collection Transfer program, the National Gallery of Art has acquired 40 works by 21 African American artists from the southern United States. The major acquisition from the Foundation s collection includes nine quilts by the artists of Gee s Bend, Alabama, including Mary Lee Bendolph and Irene Williams three paintings, three drawings, and one sculpture by Thornton Dial works on paper by Nellie Mae Rowe, Henry Speller, Georgia Speller, and Royal Robertson four sculpted heads by James Son Ford Thomas, which were featured in the National Gallery s Outliers and American Vanguard Art exhibition (January 28 May 13, 2018) and three sculptures by Lonnie Holley. With this acquisition, the Gallery joins other prominent museums that have acquired works from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation including the Brooklyn Museum, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Phillips Collection. The Souls Grown Deep Collection Transfer program was launched in 2014 to bring attention to these artists fundamental contribution to the narrative of American art history, manifested in exhibitions, publications, programming, and increased public awareness and appreciation. Funds received through artwork purchase support the Souls Grown Deep Community Partnership, which promotes economic empowerment, racial and social justice, and educational advancement in relevant regions, and the recently announced Resale Royalty Award Program, which bestows monetary awards to living artists who are part of the Foundation s collection and whose works have since been sold through the Collection Transfer program. Mary Lee Bendolph, Blocks and Strips, 2002, wool, cotton, and corduroy, overall: 248.92 x 218.44 cm (98 x 86 in. ) National Gallery of Art, Washington Patrons' Permanent Fund and Gift of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation 2020.28.1 2017 Mary Lee Bendolph / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York The addition of notable works by artists from our collection to the National Gallery of Art and other leading institutions signifies their essential inclusion in the canon of art history. Subsequent exhibitions, educational programs, and scholarship will expose new audiences to their artistic mastery and contemporary relevance, said Maxwell L. Anderson, president, Souls Grown Deep Foundation and Community Partnership. These exciting works by artists from the American South demonstrate remarkable qualities of imaginative and conceptual daring and material inventiveness across a wide range of media and styles. In addition, many of these works offer powerful insights and perspectives on the compelling issues of our time, and we are pleased to be able to add them to our collection of modern and contemporary art, said Kaywin Feldman, director, National Gallery of Art, Washington. The acquisition expands the National Gallery of Art s holdings of modern and contemporary works by African American artists. These new pieces join works already in the collection by Emma Amos, Mark Bradford, Theaster Gates, Sam Gilliam, Oliver Lee Jackson, Glenn Ligon, Al Loving, Kerry James Marshall, Martin Puryear, Lorna Simpson, Alma Thomas, Kara Walker, Carrie Mae Weems, and Jack Whitten, among many others. The acquisition includes nine quilts made by artists from Gee s Bend a small African American community along the Alabama River where artists have created quilt masterpieces from recycled clothes and dresses, feed sacks, and fabric remnants for the last 100 years. Mary Lee Bendolph (b. 1935), one of the best known and most revered quiltmakers, uses complex geometric and color structures in an ingenious elaboration on the traditional practice of quilting in strips and blocks. In a quilt she made in 2002, rectangles of brown wool and blue denim are juxtaposed with brightly colored strips and squares that play off the structural framework of the ""Housetop"" pattern, a conventional design of concentric squares that is popular among the quiltmakers of Gee s Bend. According to Bendolph, her works draw inspiration from the colors, shapes, and patterns of the world around her, resulting in designs that are abstract remappings of the visual environment. Of the many Gee s Bend quiltmakers in the Souls Grown Deep collection, others included in the acquisition are Mary L. Bennett (b. 1942), Flora Moore (b. 1951), Lucy P. Pettway (1930 2003), Missouri Pettway (1902 1981), Sally Mae Pettway Mixon (b. 1965), Sue Willie Seltzer (1922 2010), and Irene Williams (1920 2015). Several works by Thornton Dial (1928 2016) in a variety of media form another core part of this acquisition. Testing Chair (Remembering Bessie Harvey) (1995) is a throne like chair engulfed by gold and silver roots constructed after the death of fellow artist Bessie Harvey. Other works by Dial commemorate the death of Princess Diana in 1997, including a drawing, The Last Trip Home (Diana s Funeral) (1997), and a painting, Master of the Red Meat (1997). These were executed in series in the tradition of religious art cycles that memorialize the lives of holy figures. Two paintings, Refugees Trying to Get to the United States (1988) and Clothes Factory (1995), point to the struggles of migrants and the costs of industrialization. Also included in the acquisition is a work by Dial s son, Thornton Dial Jr. (b. 1953). A Man Can Be a Star (1988), made from paint, tin, carpet, sunglasses, and industrial sealing compound, depicts a figure representing Ray Charles seated in a bright red chair at a red piano against a stark white background studded with red stars. Joe Light s (1934 2005) Birdman Trainer (1987) depicts a human figure with birds perched on its head and shoulders. The composite figure (a possible self portrait, since the birdman s hair resembles that of the artist) gazes upward, becoming a kind of intermediary between heaven and earth. Purvis Young s (1943 2010) Saints (late 1970s), depicting abstracted figures with halos, is a painting on found pieces of wood carefully chosen for their texture, color, and form. Young s Untitled (mid 1980s) is an example of one of the books of colleges that the artist assembled from the many drawings he made of some of his favorite subjects: buildings in the Overtown neighborhood of Miami, Florida, funerals, horses, boats at sea, and people. Paintings by Ronald Lockett (1965 1998) and Mary T. Smith (1905 1995) are also included in this acquisition. Among the acquired works on paper are two lively, patterned drawings by Nellie Mae Rowe (1900 1982) and two drawings each by husband and wife Henry Speller (1900 1997) and Georgia Speller (1931 1988), both of whom often drew sexually charged subjects derived from popular culture and television. Royal Robertson s (1930 1997) Sevenly Out of Body Travels (1984) is an example of his drawn visions, a mythic combination of evangelism, science fiction, mass media, advertising images, and autobiographical motifs.

Africatown,"Ten Innovators to Watch in 2021 This past year left us with no shortage of incredible innovations, chief among them Covid 19 vaccines. Following a harrowing 2020, we're excited to see how innovators continue to push the envelope and bring forth what they think the world needs. From celebrating and honoring black history to improving the mental health of K 12 students, we're keeping our eyes on these ten groundbreakers as they share their visions with the world. Chicken less Egg Connoisseur Arturo Elizondo ""Like any good Mexican, I had two eggs for breakfast every morning, and like any good Texan I had my barbeque every Sunday,"" says Arturo Elizondo. But when he learned about the devastating impacts that livestock has on the environment, he set out to find a better, more sustainable way to produce animal protein. In 2014, he co founded Clara Foods with cell biologist David Anchel with a mission to take animals out of animal proteins. Similar to how brewers use yeast to convert sugar into alcohol for beer, Clara Foods uses yeast and sugar to produce animal protein. Specifically, Elizondo and his team are working to produce egg proteins one of the most challenging to find alternatives for. One trillion eggs are consumed across the globe each year, but it takes a whopping 600 gallons of water to produce a dozen eggs, he says. Since they're so versatile and globally loved, Clara Foods is offering a cleaner alternative so that people can still enjoy eggs in all their culinary forms without the tremendous environmental impact. Clara Foods has been knee deep in research and development for the last six years, but the company is officially coming out of their ""eggshell"" in 2021 when they launch the world's first egg protein made without a chicken, Elizondo says. Problem Solving Wunderkind Gitanjali Rao As a 15 year old, Gitanjali Rao is the youngest innovator on our list, but she's certainly one to watch. She's already tackling some of the greatest problems affecting current generations: lack of access to clean water, opioid addiction and cyberbullying. After hearing about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, Rao was shocked to learn that people in the United States and beyond still don't have access to safe, clean water. In response, she invented Tethys a sensor that can detect lead in water and upload results from the water sample to an app, allowing users to quickly and affordably see if water is safe to drink. She's also worked to address the opioid crisis by developing Epione, a way to diagnose prescription opioid addictions for patients at the onset of addiction, after hearing about a family friend who developed an addiction after a car accident. And to address cyberbullying a problem especially relevant to her age group Rao developed Kindly, an artificial intelligence powered software that detects hurtful or harmful messages and then prompts users to rephrase what they send. Her thoughtful, problem solving innovations earned her the title of TIME's 2020 Kid of the Year. ""My motivation to solve problems in society started in a very simple manner: to solve problems that we face on a daily basis,"" she says. ""I try my best to understand them and look for ways to address them. I am not always successful, but the few times I've succeeded, I feel like I have contributed in some way. To inspire others to innovate, Rao has connected with about 35,000 students across four continents and has more events planned in the coming months. As she moves forward in 2021, Rao says she has more ideas in the works and that she'll continue developing her current innovations as she searches for the partners to help her out. Storytelling Composer Barron Ryan On May 31, 1921, a mob of white residents attacked the Greenwood District, a predominantly black neighborhood, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in what's known as the Tulsa Race Massacre. The attack one of the worst acts of racial violence in American history continued through the next day as the mob killed more than 300 black Tulsans, displaced 10,000 others and burned more than 35 city blocks to the ground. To commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, Chamber Music Tulsa commissioned composer and performer Barron Ryan to tell the story of the tragedy through a piano trio. As a Tulsa native, Ryan says that it's important for him to tell this story a story that needs to be remembered. ""It's an integral part of who I am, and I'm honored to do it,"" he says. ""Music can tell a story without using words, and it has an unparalleled ability to communicate"" Ryan says, which is what he aspires to do with his trio. In composing the piece, he looked through firsthand accounts of the massacre. He read about a woman who hid with her daughter and read psalms as the attack raged on. Psalm 88:3 spoke to Ryan, and it ultimately inspired the melody. One of the verses reads, ""My soul is full of troubles,"" which Ryan borrowed as the title of his trio. He hopes that his music inspires people to reflect on the Tulsa Race Massacre and to be courageous to do what s right and not simply what is easy, he says. ""I'm hoping that it's well received, and that we remember our history as Tulsans and learn the right lessons and not repeat something like this again. "" Transit Trailblazer Andrea Ponti The Covid 19 pandemic brought public transportation to a screeching halt as people who had the means to travel in their own private vehicles opted to do so. Andrea Ponti, the founder and director of Ponti Design Studio, took the opportunity to re think and re plan how we get around. Inspired by social distancing, he developed Island, an electric tram designed for a post pandemic Hong Kong, the city where he resides. ""When the pandemic took over Hong Kong, many people turned to private transport causing a dramatic increase in traffic, pollution and noise,"" he says. ""What makes Island attractive is that it helps to solve all those problems. The bottom line is technology needs good design in order to be efficient and accessible to most people, and I think Island might be an example of that. "" Instead of sitting in rows, the tram's seats are organized in circles, or ""islands,"" seating people with their backs towards each other so they can look out the window instead of facing others. ""To me that is a safer way to commute and a fun way to take in the city sights and see Hong Kong from a different viewpoint,"" he says. Plus, the tram is electric and driverless, making it eco friendlier and more efficient. ""As a designer I really like the challenge of re imagining products and services that we often take for granted and that can be greatly impacted by social changes in this case re designing trams at the time of social distancing in a metropolis like Hong Kong where social distancing is hard to practice,"" he says. Ponti started developing Island in March 2020 and has since modeled the tram and produced a number of prototypes. Moving forward in 2021, he is working to scale the protypes, move into the testing phase and secure a partner to produce Island. Honoring Black History with Anitra Belle Henderson In 1860, a plantation owner smuggled in a shipload of 110 African people to Alabama on the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States, decades after the U. S. had banned the importation of enslaved people. When enslaved people were freed in 1865, survivors of the Clotilda couldn't afford to return to Africa, so they founded Africatown instead, a bustling town rooted in their homelands and cultures. After years of searching for the long lost Clotilda, a team of historians and archaeologists finally discovered it at the bottom of Alabama's Mobile River in 2019. Now, the City of Mobile will open a heritage house in the summer of 2021 to tell the story of the Clotilda's survivors and of Africatown. ""We are excited to help the community tell their story,"" says Anitra Belle Henderson, the executive director of communications and external affairs for the City of Mobile and the lead on all the Africatown projects. ""Our goal is for visitors to understand more about those who were enslaved. They have a name and a story. "" The heritage house is designed to be an immersive experience. Visitors will feel the waves of the ocean like the enslaved people felt on their voyage, read stories of the slave trade and be introduced to the survivors of the Clotilda. They'll also be able to visit Africatown, where many descendants of the Clotilda's survivors still reside. ""Each detail of the heritage house was designed with reverence to the ancestors, descendants and the community,"" Belle Henderson says. ""Those who are curious about African culture can visit an African community on American soil a community that was built with hope and promise. "" ""The many stories show the diverse brilliance of black people,"" she says. ""Since the discovery of the Clotilda there has been a new excitement in the community. Educating people about Africatown's past will definitely create a bright future for a community that so deserves the attention it is receiving. "" Nautical Visionary Brett Phaneuf In April 2021, the Mayflower Autonomous Ship, one of the world's first full sized self navigating ships, will set sail from the United Kingdom's Plymouth Harbor and traverse the Atlantic Ocean to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. It will retrace the voyage made by the original Mayflower in 1620 that brought Pilgrims to New England, but instead of looking back at 400 years of history, it represents what the next wave of nautical advances will look like. The Mayflower Autonomous Ship is a collaboration between the marine research organization ProMare and IBM, which developed the ship's artificial intelligence systems that will allow it to navigate unassisted across the ocean. The Mayflower team is hoping to revolutionize ocean research by creating an affordable option for scientists to study the ocean without necessarily being on board a ship. Without needing to worry about the logistics for housing people on board, like sleeping, eating and sanitation, the ship can accommodate more technology, like cameras and sensors, and stay out at sea longer. ""If it works as designed, then it will substantially drive down the cost of collecting data at sea,"" says Phaneuf, a co founder and co director of the Mayflower Autonomous Ship project. ""This will lead to a better understanding of our oceans and climate. "" Phaneuf's biggest hope for the Mayflower is that it makes it across the ocean and sparks the conversation about how autonomous ships can be used to study the high seas. During this first voyage, the ship will collect meteorological and oceanographic data as well as water samples to study microplastic distribution. Student Advocate Samantha Pratt Two thirds of all U. S. youth face at least one trauma by age 16 that can stem from poverty, racism, domestic or community violence, or substance abuse, says Samantha Pratt, the CEO and founder of KlickEngage. ""Students carry heavy emotional backpacks into the classroom every day that they cannot put down,"" she says. ""I was teaching high need students in an overcrowded classroom and could not check in with each of my students every day in order to address their issues. Out of urgent need, I decided that I had to find a way to streamline student self report. "" To do so, Pratt designed KlickEngage an app that allows users to self report their mental state each day by completing a two minute survey. The app, which has reached thousands of kids, then provides students with targeted coping mechanisms while delivering real time data to educators so that they can identify and supports students carrying heavy emotional loads, Pratt says. Schools have the ability to make a huge impact for students by providing health services and resources, but they're often limited and underfunded. ""By directly serving students, teachers and schools, we limit the impacts of adverse experiences on school engagement in early years of education so that there is a higher likelihood of student success in later years, breaking the cycle of trauma and poverty,"" Pratt says. Students are still facing adversities, plus the compounded issues brought on by the Covid 19 pandemic, such as unemployment, food insecurity and fear based anxiety, Pratt says. Since KlickEngage is able to be adapted for a physical or virtual learning environment, it can help educators check in with students, even from a distance. In 2021, KlickEngage is planning to grow its impact and reach more classrooms. Pandemic Inspired Architects Jing Liu and Florian Idenburg In 2020, homes transformed into all in one offices, gyms, daycares, classrooms, vacation destinations and restaurants as people's lives became confined to their residences. As a result, people noticed just how important their home environment is to their mental and emotional wellbeing, say Jing Liu and Florian Idenburg, the founding partners of SO IL, an architecture and design firm. At the outset of the Covid 19 pandemic, Liu and Idenburg were in the beginning stages of designing a new 30 unit residential building in Brooklyn. They also found themselves adjusting to living and working from home with their two daughters, and they say that experience helped shape the design for the new building, to be completed in 2022. Now that people are home all the time, Liu and Idenburg needed to create a space that was both multi functional and comfortable for residents. For example, they moved bedrooms to opposite sides of the apartment to muffle noise and distractions, which are typically clustered together. They also incorporated multiple outdoor spaces for each unit, creating easy access to fresh air and sunshine. The pandemic has highlighted what people really need in their homes, and architecture trends in the future will reflect that, they say. ""The main lesson to take away is that the lifespan of a building will be longer than the interval between pandemics,"" they say. ""From a sustainability standpoint, we should endeavor to build buildings that last 'forever. ' It means we need to design for future pandemics. "" Mosquito Trapping Mastermind Kennyjie When industrial designer Kennyjie (he prefers to go by just his first name) was 12 years old, he contracted dengue fever a flu like disease transmitted by mosquitos while living in Indonesia. ""Being able to afford long hospital care, I was one of the privileged kids who walked out alive,"" he says. Mosquito borne disease prevention has remained an issue close to his heart, and it's the driving force behind his new innovation, Quito. While visiting Bali, Kennyjie noticed that the mosquito prevention tactics were inconvenient and ineffective, so he set out to design his own. Quito, which made the International Top 20 for the James Dyson Award in 2020, uses a simple chemical reaction to produce carbon dioxide and an artificial human odor to attract mosquitoes, and then it vacuums them into a chamber. By luring mosquitoes in instead of repelling them, Quito reduces their local population and the chance of disease transmission. It's designed to be placed in tropical resorts to lessen the likelihood of an outbreak as people travel in and out of the region. Kennyjie traveled through multiple Indonesian villages to ensure that Quito's design is informed by the local culture, economy and climate so that it fits into the ""geographical context in which it is needed,"" he says. This year, Kennyjie will continue running more tests from his home in Melbourne, Australia, until international borders are open and he can start pilot tests in Indonesia. "

The sign at the Breakneck Ridge trailhead says This is not just a walk in the park. Well, the sign reveals it all. Nevertheless, despite the challenges and difficulties, Breakneck Ridge is one of the famous climbs in the Hudson Valley. Lying within Hudson Highlands State Park, it offers many stunning views of the river and region and is quite popular with hikers. However, here is a list of things you need to know before you start climbing Breakneck Ridge. ALSO READ Trekking near Bengaluru: Here are best 4 trekking spots that you must visit Five things to know before climbing the Breakneck Ridge It is a stunning and beautiful road trip to the Breakneck Ridge trek point. If you have a car, a road trip is always a great idea. The parking area is right past the Route 9D tunnel, just after Cold Spring. The trailhead is on the northern side of the tunnel. If you do not have a car, you can also book the train tickets to the trek. Take the MTA Metro North Railroad from Grand Central to the Breakneck stop (it s the Hudson line). Make sure you get round trip tickets at Grand Central because there are no machines at Breakneck. Ticket prices are about USD 20 and trains run every hour. Take the white blazes that route up the mountain. When you walk up to the mountain, follow the white blazes up to the top. Expect slippery rocks. To avoid slipping off from the stones, wear proper hiking shoes and do not forget to carry your hiking gear. The trail is crowded as it is one of the famous treks. However, it is not bad because people are friendly and willing to help you at the tougher spots.

Hollandtown,"Gun rights: Brown County could be 'Second-Amendment sanctuary,' at least in name GREEN BAY A proposal to make Brown County a ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" survived a review by county supervisors Monday, but emerged in a much weaker form than originally proposed. The board's Executive Committee voted 7 0 to recommend the county proclaim its intent to oppose future legislation the county deems would infringe on residents' right to keep and bear arms. The committee also recommend the county declare itself a Second Amendment sanctuary. But members removed controversial and possibly illegal language that said the sheriff could refuse to enforce future gun control laws if he deemed them unconstitutional. David Hemery, the county's chief legal officer, said such a measure likely would have violated supervisors' oaths of office. RELATED: Florence County, Wis. , declares itself 2nd Amendment sanctuary RELATED: Virginia counties declare themselves 'sanctuaries' for 2nd Amendment RELATED: Evers announces red flag bill, says he's open to mandatory gun buybacks The vote followed two hours of sometimes passionate public comment from more than two dozen people on both sides of the issue with sanctuary county supporters holding a majority. More than 50 people attended the meeting. ""We have people in government who are trying to whittle away our freedoms,"" said Brian Johnson, a Green Bay resident and military veteran who supports the sanctuary county proposal. ""After the erosion starts, it can't be stopped. "" But others saw things differently. ""The basic notion of a sanctuary county is by nature a bad idea,"" said Rick Beverstein. He called the proposal ""unworkable, unenforceable, divisive an un American. "" The full Count Board is slated to vote on the measure Jan. 15. The weaker resolution was proposed by Board Chairman Patrick Moynihan Jr. It's a compromise between the wishes of board members who wanted to protect residents against what they fear will be attempts by the state or federal government to improperly limit gun ownership rights, and those concerned that it would be improper to try to direct a sheriff, elected by the voters, to not enforce a law that might or might not be enacted in the future. Supervisor Steve Deslauriers of Hollandtown proposed the sanctuary measure in December, saying that further tightening of gun laws threatens to take ""the most effective weapon away"" from someone who might need a gun for self defense. ""What this is is a strong message to legislators to not do what Virginia is doing,"" said Deslauriers, a gun owner. ""It's counter to the Constitution anyone who thinks the Second Amendment is not under attack is naive. "" More than 100 Virginia cities, counties and towns have recently approved sanctuary laws, in response to a promise by Gov. Ralph Northam and a number of state lawmakers to seek stricter gun laws. Proposals also have been adopted in Arizona, Colorado and a number of other states. The resolutions are largely symbolic local government can't order a police chief to not enforce federal and state laws but supporters say they are important because they make a strong statement about constituents' wishes, and keep the issue in the public eye. Gun safety advocates say they're something else: publicity stunts. The sanctuary proposals in Wisconsin and elsewhere are being made as governors and other state lawmakers push for gun laws that would require universal background checks, and to support ""red flag"" laws that would make it tougher for persons deemed dangerous to get guns. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers made it clear last year that he would be open to gun law reform. He said in September that he supports so called ""red flag"" legislation, and would be open to some form of gun buybacks. Republicans in the state Legislature have not welcomed those ideas. Brown would have been the second Wisconsin county to approve such a measure. Florence County did so in November. USA TODAY reporter Ryan W. Miller contributed to this story.

Hollandtown,"Gun rights: What to know about Brown County's 'Second Amendment sanctuary' proposal GREEN BAY A vote Wednesday night will determine if Brown County gives itself the label of ""Second Amendment sanctuary. "" But the proposal county supervisors will consider bears little resemblance to ordinances being adopted in Virginia and other parts of the nation where the gun control debate has heated to a boil in recent months. Brown County's 26 supervisors are slated to vote on a proposal, from Steve Deslauriers of Hollandtown, that a committee stripped of its teeth last week. Deslauriers, a first term supervisor who's not seeking reelection, hoped to empower Sheriff Todd Delain to decide if state level gun laws that might be adopted in the future were ""constitutional. "" Delain had the measure passed would have had the board's blessing to not enforce parts with which he did not agree. The board's Executive Committee, however, agreed with Corporation Counsel David Hemery that doing so is not something they have the power to do. The Executive Committee then voted 7 0 to recommend the full board approve a stripped own version. That version includes wording that would label the county a Second Amendment sanctuary, but would not try to encourage the sheriff to ignore future gun legislation he didn't believe constitutional. RELATED: Brown Co. could be 'Second Amendment sanctuary,' at least in name RELATED: Florence County declares itself 2nd Amendment sanctuary RELATED: Virginia counties declare themselves 'sanctuaries' for 2nd Amendment RELATED: Evers announces red flag bill, says he's open to mandatory gun buybacks Here's what to know about Brown County's proposal: Legality fears Supervisors acknowledge that the job of determining if something is constitutional belongs to the judicial branch of government the courts. The county's sheriff isn't a judge his career has been focused on enforcing the laws that are on the books, not writing them or assessing which are proper and which aren't. Supervisors also can't tell an elected official like the sheriff how to do his job be it enforcing a law, or not enforcing a law. The sheriff reports only to the people of the county. ""It would be unconstitutional for us to have the sheriff decide what's constitutional,"" Green Bay Supervisor Tom Sieber said. ""It's clearly contrary to the oath we have sworn. "" Executive Committee members also doubt the county has the right to ignore a law on the books at the federal or state level, though some people might argue that some communities have done so in labeling themselves sanctuaries from enforcement of immigration law. Such an issue would likely have to be resolved by a court. Finally, Deslauriers' proposal had a ""crystal ball"" element that made some supervisors uncomfortable. It essentially assumes that the state or federal government would pass a certain type of law restricting gun rights, and that the law would somehow violate the Constitution. Delain, who calls himself a strong Second Amendment supporter, was at the committee meeting, but was not asked to speak. He told USA TODAY Network Wisconsin last week that he swore an oath to uphold the laws of the state and nation, and plans to continue to do just that. What happens Wednesday? The County Board agenda calls for the 26 supervisors to vote on the stripped own resolution suggested by Board Chairman Patrick Moynihan Jr. Moynihan's resolution would label Brown ""a Second Amendment Sanctuary,"" and recommend the county declare its intent to oppose future legislation it deems would infringe on residents' right to bear arms, but it would not try to empower the sheriff to interpret the constitutionality of future state or federal laws. Supervisors could request more discussion of the matter. Moynihan and the board can decide if they'll accept more public comment the committee heard two hours of that last week. Also, one or more supervisors might try to pursue making the county more of a sanctuary. To do so would likely require the board to take an action their attorney has told them they're not legally entitled to take. What's driving the movement? Attempts to pass ""sanctuary"" laws have spring up in municipalities in a number of states, with varying passage rates. The effort lately is focused on states that recently elected Democratic governors who are known, or believed, to support measures like universal background checks and ""red flag"" laws. The latter would make it harder for certain people some who've been judged to be dangerous, others with certain levels of mental illness to acquire guns. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers made it clear last year he is open to legal changes that would make it harder for dangerous people to get guns. He said in September that he supports so called ""red flag"" legislation, and would be open to a program for the government to ""buy back"" certain types of guns. Republicans in Wisconsin's Legislature have not welcomed those ideas. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has made comments similar to Evers'. More than 110 Virginia communities, including most counties and the state's most populous city, Virginia Beach, have approved sanctuary laws. That's created a patchwork of differing regulations across the state, which is strictly pro gun ownership in some areas, and heavily pro gun control in others. Gun safety advocates say such efforts are mere publicity stunts, and point to a recent opinion by Virginia's attorney general that says gun sanctuary ordinances are essentially unenforceable. Elsewhere in Wisconsin Communities so far have not shown a great interest in adopting sanctuary laws. Florence County, in the Northwoods, is the lone county to authorize its sheriff to ignore gun laws he believes aren't constitutional. A committee of the Marinette County Board voted 5 1 last week not to forward a gun sanctuary proposal to the full board, the Eagle Herald newspaper reported. A petition posted to Change. org calls for Marinette to be a Second Amendment sanctuary.

Hollandtown,"Gun rights: No 'Second Amendment sanctuary' in Brown County after close vote GREEN BAY Four plus hours. Multiple votes. Occasionally heated discussion. But no ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" in Brown County. On a day when the gun rights debate heated up in Virginia, a proposal in Brown County failed when supporters could muster only 13 of the 14 votes needed from the 26 supervisors. Discussion sometimes grew heated as more than 50 members of the public addressed the board over a two hour span. At one point, sheriff's officials rushed into the meeting to break up an argument between speakers. ""I don't want no guns near me, a ,"" one man yelled. RELATED: Brown Co. 'Second Amendment sanctuary' proposal: What to know RELATED: Virginia governor plans to ban guns from gun rights rally RELATED: Merrill becomes Second Amendment sanctuary, opposes gun limits RELATED: Florence County declares itself 2nd Amendment sanctuary Supervisor Steve Deslauriers of Hollandtown proposed last week that Brown County designate itself a sanctuary, and empower Sheriff Todd Delain to ignore future gun laws the sheriff felt violated the Constitution. ""Mass shootings are egregious and most are done by criminals who shouldn't have guns,"" Deslauriers said. ""Guns are only a problem when the user is insane. "" The proposal, as it had a week earlier, continued to divide supervisors. Supporters insisted it would protect gun owners against what they feared would be future overreach by Gov. Tony Evers and other state officials who have expressed an interest in ""red flag"" legislation and other measures designed to make it harder for dangerous people to get guns. Opponents saw the proposal as government overreach that would have no impact simply a local official's stunt to make it so the county could illegally end run future gun laws adopted at higher levels of government. That debate continued Wednesday, among supervisors and the public. ""You're worried about your gun rights going away,"" said Jan Palmer, one of the first people to speak. ""We're worried about being shot. "" Palmer, who works in a school, spoke of having to teach children with whom she works what to do if ""a bad man"" with a gun enters their school. But speaker John Mahon of Hobart insisted northeastern Wisconsin is safer than other places he has lived because it doesn't restrict gun ownership. ""California has all the gun laws the anti Second Amendment people want,"" he said. ""In the town I grew up in, the violent crime is four to five times what it is in Green Bay. "" Had Brown County approved Delauriers' proposal, it would have joined Merrill which approved a measure on Tuesday and Florence County as sanctuary communities. A Marinette County committee recently rejected an attempt to send a sanctuary proposal to the full board of supervisors gun rights advocates are now trying the Change. org petition route. Nationally, the gun rights debate is heating up in another state where a recently elected Democratic governor has said he's considering tougher gun measures in an effort to reduce gun crime. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam said he plans to declare an emergency and ban firearms around the state Capitol before a gun rights rally Monday that could draw thousands of armed people and militias from Virginia and out of state. More than 110 Virginia communities, including most counties and the state's most populous city, Virginia Beach, have approved sanctuary laws Gun rights advocates organizing the event promised a ""peaceful day to address our Legislature"" in Richmond, Virgina. But their efforts sparked a much larger, grassroots movement that has drawn interest from gun owners and militias around the country. Northam said that intelligence from police agencies indicates out of state militias and hate groups fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories have ""malicious plans. "" ""They're not coming to peacefully protest,"" he said. ""They are coming to intimidate and cause harm. "" 'Sound and fury' A number of Brown County supervisors, while saying they continue to abide by their oath of office, which includes a pledge to uphold the laws of the land, said they doubted if declaring the county a sanctuary would have any impact. They also said they lack the authority to grant the sheriff an elected official over whom they have no power the right to ignore state and/or federal laws that haven't yet been adopted. ""This proposal is full of sound and fury signifying nothing,"" said Bellevue's Paul Ballard, borrowing from Shakespeare. ""I am a gun owner, and I took an oath to make this county a better place, but now we've wasted 3 hours on things that don't make this county a better place. I hope my fellow supervisors wake up and say, 'this is not the place. '"" Supervisors tried other means to approve a sanctuary proposal. Howard's Ray Suennen proposed placing an advisory referendum on the ballot in November that failed 23 3. Suennen, Wrightstown's John Van Dyck and Howard's Richard Schadewald were the only supporters. Attempts by supervisors Joan Brusky of Allouez and Keith Deneys of Pittsfield to amend Delauriers' proposal also failed. Delain said three people who argued loudly during the meeting left City Hall voluntarily after deputies spoke with them.

Rubbertown,"Mayor Greg Fischer honors pioneer Mattie Jones with the 2020 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award Jones, who describes herself as just another soldier in the army for peace, justice, and equality, said she is honored by the award. LOUISVILLE, Ky. Mayor Greg Fischer will honor nationally renowned civil rights and social justice activist Mattie Jones with the 2020 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award. Jones is a native of Memphis, Tenn. , but moved with her family to Louisville as a child, after her father took a job at the Quartermaster Depot in Jeffersonville. According to Mayor Greg Fischer's announcement, Jones public activism began not long after her graduation from Central High School in 1951. She attended Indiana University but says she quickly decided it was not safe or welcoming for black students, so she transferred to the University of Louisville, which had recently desegregated its main campus. But after being denied a work study position and being told white co eds would not accept working alongside her, Jones left college and joined the Black Workers Coalition to fight for equality in employment. In over six decades of activism since, Jones has organized countless demonstrations, public conversations, and boycotts focused on women s and worker s rights, environmental justice, peace, and police/community relations. Jones was a founding member of the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and has helped lead and staff numerous local and national justice operations during her long career. At the tender age of 86, Mattie Jones has outlived some of our community s original civil rights stalwarts, and to this day, she outworks many others to remain an active advocate for justice, equality, and equity, said Mayor Fischer. Mattie s battles and victories over the years against racism and sexism only make her advocacy and inspiration more powerful. There is no quit in Mattie. She is most worthy of this significant recognition. "" Jones, who describes herself as just another soldier in the army for peace, justice, and equality, said she is honored by the award. I appreciate Mayor Fischer making me this year s honoree, and I appreciate too, that Mayor Fischer did not forget west Louisville after Election Day. When invited, he shows, and that s important, Jones said, adding that she ll be accepting the award on behalf of her family and her community. If it wasn t for God, my family and my community, I would never had made it. My husband caring for the children, my mother s support, the people who maybe didn t march or demonstrate but would walk by and wave and say, Miss Mattie, we re praying for you, I needed them all, she said. To experience and be a part of the changes in my lifetime, I am blessed to have been a soldier, a majorette for justice! Jones said receiving the Freedom Award is especially poignant for her since she is a native of Memphis and was there helping prepare for an upcoming demonstration on April 4, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated. It s hard to describe how awful that was, Jones said. Dr. King was not the only organizer and not the only agitator of our time, but he was a beacon for justice, and his death brought such darkness. In the 60 s she marched against segregation in public schools and for open housing and credits the late Sen. Georgia Davis Powers, then a neighbor in the Parkland neighborhood, for inspiring her to get involved. She asked me to attend a meeting, and when I got there, there was Dr. King, Rev. Abernathy, and so many other inspirational people. I left there on fire, Jones said. On the environmental justice front, Jones fought against toxic emissions in Rubbertown and for greater oversight of the companies there, through the Strategic Toxic Air Reduction program. And through the Louisville Black Chamber of Commerce, she and Coleman worked to see a high percentage of minority owned construction companies involved in the building of Papa John s Cardinal Stadium and the YUM! Center. In 2018, in honor of Mattie Jones 85th birthday, then Councilwoman Cheri Bryant Hamilton announced that two blocks of River Park Drive would be honorarily designated as Mattie Jones Way. The route intersects Louis Coleman Jr. Drive, which Jones bio notes reflect a meaningful reminder of all these two influential civil rights leaders accomplished together in Louisville and far beyond. Mayor Fischer will present the Freedom Award on Jan. 19 during the Keepers of the Dream community arts celebration dedicated to Dr. King, in Whitney Hall at the Kentucky Center on Main Street. The event, which is free and open to the public, begins at 5 p. m. , with lobby activities from 3:30 to 4:45 p. m. Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

THEY ALWAYS PLAY THE SPEECH I HAVE A DREAM. DR. KING WAS MORE THAN A DREAMER. THE CHANGES THAT HAVE COME LET US KNOW HE WAS MORE Advertisement Social justice pioneer to receive top Louisville honor Jones will be honored by the mayor of Louisville Share Copy Link Copy At nearly 87 years old, Mattie Jones has spent decades of her life fighting for racial equality and social justice. This weekend, Jones will be honored by the mayor of Louisville. She is the 2020 recipient of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award. Mattie s battles and victories over the years against racism and sexism only make her advocacy and inspiration more powerful. There is no quit in Mattie, Mayor Greg Fischer wrote in a news release announcing her recognition. Jones name has graced headlines, both locally and nationally, as she promoted justice. I can remember the police officers with guns and water hoses, Jones told WLKY News on Friday. She marched in Selma and worked alongside Dr. King. She said her life of activism began after she transferred from Indiana University to University of Louisville. She credits an unfair U of L campus job interview with igniting her passion for activism. He (the employer) says, You made all the criteria for the job, but the ladies out there won't work with you. I said 'You ask those ladies out there what color is my mother's money that they enter into that register,' and I got up didn't say any more. I had passed the angry mark. Now, I'm at the mad mark, she said from her living room on the west side of Louisville. Segregation didn't really hit me until that day. Being black did not really hit me until that day, Jones added. Emotions transformed into action once she joined the Black Workers' Coalition. Her environmental work helped pinpoint West Louisville for having the highest cancer rate. It started, she said, when people near Rubbertown began to fall ill. One of my kids began to get a rash, something like hives or something, almost every week, said Jones. We could smell the odors and see the white stuff, but we didn t know until we began to ask questions and that began to open up the door. She said that once they began asking questions, she refused to stop. That brought the determination that, uh uh, you're not going to kill us all, said Jones. In 2018, her street was shut down and renamed after her for Jones 85th birthday party. She said she s flattered to receive the mayor s award. They always play the speech ""I Have a Dream. "" Dr. King was more than a dreamer. The changes that have come let us know that he was more than a dreamer, said Jones. Mayor Fischer will present Jones the award Sunday during the ""Keepers of the Dream"" community arts celebration. It s happening at Whitney Hall inside the Kentucky Center. The event is free and includes lobby activities that start at 3:30 p. m. The ceremony starts at 5 p. m. "

Walshtown,"South Dakota townships make move to leave county Michelle Rook Forum News Service YANKTON COUNTY, S. D. Residents in four South Dakota townships could make history if they re successful in seceding from Yankton County. The action is being led by farmers who say the Yankton County Commission is no longer allowing them the freedom to operate because of county agricultural zoning rules. Irene farmer Simon Healy helped organize a meeting Jan. 4 in Irene with more than 150 people in attendance to discuss the options. The commission that we have now has gone above and beyond to make it hard for livestock in our community and making the conditional use permits for . one chicken. For one animal unit, you had to get state certified every year, he says. Previously, Healy says, the county followed the state rules for granting a conditional use permit for livestock, and operations were permitted and inspected at 1000 animal units and above. The residents of Mayfield, Turkey Valley, Marindahl and Walshtown townships are in the northern edge of the county. They were originally talking about merging the townships with Turner County, but they now have a second option, which is forming their own county. It is possible that the new county could merge with Turner or another county in the future. At the meeting, Sioux Falls attorney Brian Donahoe detailed those options under South Dakota codified law. Donahoe explained that to bring either action to a vote in the November election, it requires signatures from 15% of the residents in the townships, plus the county or counties. For the option of merging with Turner County it requires 15% of the registered voters of Yankton County and 15% of the registered voters of Turner County, he says. It is done by a petition that is presented to the county commissioners in each county, and they set a vote, which would likely coincide with the November general election. Each county and a majority of the people who live in the township seeking to merge with Turner County have to approve that by a simple majority, he says. To bring a vote on making a separate county, Donahoe says it would only require 15% of the township members sign a petition. It would then go to a vote of the entire county and a majority is still needed for approval. And it s a majority in each area. So, a majority of people who live in the potential new county and a majority of the people who live in the greater of Yankton County, he says. That may be a little easier road to go because we don t have to have Turner County s approval right now, we just have to focus on Yankton. Plus, the signing of the petition would be a heck of a lot easier with only 15% of the four townships having to sign off versus 15% of the whole county, he says. However, Healy admits getting a majority of Yankton County voters to pass their petition will be a tough lift. He says they ll be holding organizational meetings in the coming days to determine which option they are taking and start circulating petitions. If the townships merge with Turner County, Donahoe says they would be subject to that county s livestock zoning ordinance. However, if they create a new county, they could write their own rules or not have any county zoning ordinances. In the latter case, they would still fall under state general permit. Donahoe says once the new county was organized, it would also have to form its own government and pick a county seat. Dan Klimisch is chairman of the Yankton County Commission and says he was taken back by the announcement. It was surprising because none of the leaders have come in and voiced any concern whatsoever. Their reasons are based on inaccuracies. I think if they would have come and spoke with us first, we could have ironed a lot of this out, he says. According to Klimisch, the commission did not make any changes in the county livestock zoning rules, which were put in place in 2006 detailing the conditional use permit process. It covers not just livestock, but any business. Not one part of our zoning has been changed. It s the same thing we ve had for the last 14 years, he says. Klimisch also says they re not changing the way the rules are being enforced, including the Class F division for from one to 299 animal units. He says the idea that they would require a conditional use permit for one chicken is false. I feel that we are living up to the intent of the zoning ordinance, he says. In fact, he says he thinks the past commission failed to be consistent with the Class F permitting requirements because they required a conditional use permit for some projects but building permits for others. Really what we brought was even dealing with everybody at having a conditional use process, that way the applicants and the neighbors and surrounding people know what s going on, Klimisch says. The Yankton County Commission has been called anti livestock, which Klimisch refutes. He says he s a fifth generation farmer, his brother and father farm full time, and his family has been farming in Yankton for more than 136 years. We love agriculture. It s No. 1 here, but this new type of industrial ag needs to be safe for all residents. I see a future for livestock development in Yankton County, but it needs to be done right, he says. "

Leestown,"Two more REAL ID regional licensing offices opening in Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Secretary of Transportation Jim Gray gave an update on Wednesday about Kentucky's REAL ID program. The deadline for Kentucky to comply with the federal REAL ID Act is in October. The two announced a new project manager dedicated to making sure Kentuckians have compliant IDs. Sarah Jackson will serve in the transportation cabinet and report directly to Secretary Gray. After years of delays, Kentucky chose to distribute REAL ID compliant driver's licenses through 12 regional offices. Right now, only two regional offices are open in Frankfort and Bowling Green. Gov. Beshear announced Paducah and Somerset would be the next cities to offer REAL ID licenses. Each office will initially have one station but will expand capacity in the coming months to serve Kentuckians throughout the region. There are plans to open an office in Lexington. The legislature's Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee approved money to rent office space on Leestown Center Way in Lexington.

Juneautown,"City Streets: Custer’s Last Stand in Milwaukee There s still a city street that honors him. Or is it named after a Town of Granville settler? Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee Who was Custer Avenue named for? Was it an early Town of Granville settler named Harvey Custer or United States Army cavalry leader George Armstrong Custer? According to the first edition of Our Roots Grow Deep, the 1943 publication of the Superintendent of Milwaukee Public Schools, Custer High School, like other city public schools was named according to the streets upon which they are located. Consequently, the publication continues, the school was named for George Custer, famous cavalry leader. (Note: A new Custer High School was later built nearby on N. Sherman Boulevard). The second edition of the publication, printed in 1974, gives a different explanation. The original school located at N. 37th and W. Custer Avenue, the latter reportedly named after an early North Milwaukee settler, Harvey Custer. So, which edition of Our Roots Grow Deep was correct about the street s roots? Milwaukee County Register of Deeds records show the street was initially named in Payne s Addition, a subdivision planned in 1892. It included new streets named Sheridan, Wallace, Hammond, and Custer. There are often patterns to the naming of streets in new developments. Byron Kilbourn and his associates named many of the streets in Kilbourntown for trees. Only Walnut and Cherry streets survive, but there were others. Poplar (now W. McKinley Avenue), Chestnut (W. Juneau Avenue), Tamarack (W. State Street), Cedar (W. Kilbourn Avenue), and Sycamore (W. Michigan Street), are all gone but were part of the tree naming pattern. For example,and his associates named many of the streets in Kilbourntown for trees. Only Walnut and Cherry streets survive, but there were others. Poplar (now W. McKinley Avenue), Chestnut (W. Juneau Avenue), Tamarack (W. State Street), Cedar (W. Kilbourn Avenue), and Sycamore (W. Michigan Street), are all gone but were part of the tree naming pattern. Solomon Juneau named streets in Juneautown for national and regional political figures including Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John Marshall, Lewis Cass, and Stevens Thomson Mason. The pattern in Henry Clay Payne s development was Union Army military figures during the Civil War. Sheridan Avenue is undoubtedly named for Civil War hero General Philip Sheridan. General Lew Wallace, who gained fame after the war as the author of the novel Ben Hur, was likely the inspiration for the naming of Wallace Avenue. Hammond Avenue was probably a tribute to William Alexander Hammond, the Surgeon General of the army during the war and the founder of the Army Medical Museum. Major General George Armstrong Custer, another Civil War hero, was unquestionably honored with the naming of Custer Avenue. Wallace and Hammond avenues were eventually renamed but Sheridan and Custer avenues still exist. So, what about Harvey Custer? Well, there never was a Harvey Custer. Harvey Carter, according to the Town of Granville, Clerks Records and Minutes, was elected constable of the township in 1842. The Illustrated Historical Atlas of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin later misspelled Carter s name as Custer when listing the men elected as the first officials of the Town of Granville. This misspelling gave rise to the Harvey Custer myth. Harvey Carter s existence was substantiated in Granville census listings of 1840, 1842, and 1846. He was also elected to other positions in the town in 1844 and 1846. There are no entries for a Harvey Custer in any of these sources. So why was there a desire to attribute the street name to a single mention of a Custer that was not supported by any other records? The answer is that George Armstrong Custer was a documented bigot. It was not politically correct that a school, particularly one with a high percentage of African Americans, had been named for a man, who, according to his biographer, Robert Utley, was not in favor of recruiting blacks into the military, judging shovels and hoes as more fitting for them than muskets. Further, when Custer requested a commission, he specifically requested that he not be given a black unit. Regarding black suffrage, Custer said, I should as soon think of elevating an Indian chief to the popedom of Rome. The whole issue of who Custer High School was named for became moot in 2011 when the school s name was changed to Milwaukee Campus for Trades, Technology and Media. It was later changed again and is now known as the Barack Obama School of Career and Technical Education. After his heroic service in the Civil War, George Armstrong Custer s name became even more well known with his defeat and death at the hands of the combined forces of three American Indian tribes at the Battle of Little Bighorn in the Montana Territory in 1876, known today as Custer s Last Stand. There is no doubt that the mostly residential W. Custer Avenue, which runs between N. 13th and N. 106th streets at 5400 north, was named for George Armstrong Custer and not an imaginary Harvey Custer.

Hangtown,"Camping ordinance passed  Placerville City Council tackles homelessness woes It s now the law of the land, at least as far as Placerville is concerned: By giving the homeless three options regarding where they may pitch a tent when local church shelters or any other shelters are not available, the City Council is hoping that camping along trails, in city parks and other public property will cease to be a problem. An ordinance intended to keep residents safe, not having to deal with, for example, someone sleeping alongside the El Dorado Trail as the family goes for a Sunday stroll, not fearing children will stumble upon used hypodermic needles as they play ball at Rotary Park, was unanimously approved Jan. 14. The Camping on Public Property ordinance, which actually was an amendment to the city s 2014 ordinance, originally was presented as a law that would prohibit any camping whatsoever on city property at any time, giving Placerville police a tool to use in enforcing their response to calls regarding problem transients. Drifters and other homeless who throw up impromptu campsites in areas where fire danger is a risk, building campfires to heat food, leave unsanitary garbage in their wake and create other hazardous situations prompted the City Council to try to beef up the rules. But before the ordinance could be passed last fall, the council, upon learning of a recent decision favoring homeless plaintiffs in a case out of Boise, Idaho, ordered the law to be rewritten to allow limited camping on city property instead of outlawing homeless campers outright. (Three locations have been selected: lower Main Street, Broadway and off Highway 193 just north of the city). But the new ordinance, the council was told at last week s meeting by an activist for the homeless, still is illegal and doesn t comply with the federal appellate court decision that states, simply, that those camping on public lands may not be cited or arrested or even told to move on, not unless there is a shelter with an available bed located nearby. By designating three areas where camping may occur without worrying about a visit from police, City Attorney John Driscoll told the council he thinks the city is on firm footing, within the parameters of the Boise decision. Police Chief James Ortega, who prepared a report for the council s perusal Tuesday, reminded the crowd at Town Hall that new law was never intended to be an ordinance to arrest the homeless. It is, instead, a way for the police to help make Placerville residents feel safe and to try not to have our city destroyed, he said. These (homeless) camps have no restroom facilities or refuse pick up, which creates a major public health concern for not only the occupants of the camps, but the public as well, Ortega states in his report. Due to the conditions various pests are attracted which increases the likelihood of the spread of sickness and disease. Substance abuse problems often plague the homeless, the police chief pointed out, and the dangers of the campsites include a pronounced criminal element. Many of the subjects have active warrants sex registration offenses and attempt to abscond from parole and or probation. As a result the camps can be dangerous for those living in them Ortega has said at past council meetings that the police wish to protect not only the residents of the city, but to provide help to the homeless who are being victimized by the darker element. Council members also heard from advocates for the homeless, including one man who for years has helped run the area s nomadic shelter that on a limited basis offers a place to sleep at local churches. Don Vanderkar told the panel he would hope the city would not merely pass a new law regulating camping, but try to do something to help the homeless find a way out of their plight. In the 10 years I have been working with homeless people, I have learned that the first thing they need is a safe place to stay where they re not constantly focused on survival, said Vanderkar, prior to discussion on the camping ordinance. The 40 year Placerville resident said the homeless often huddle through the cold night, in an icy hovel where they fear being robbed and raped. The speaker said the problem is growing nationwide and added that if government officials don t take steps to address the issue, local churches and volunteers simply won t be enough to deal with the situation. Local public agencies have not acted, charged Vanderkar. Local churches and volunteers are working very hard to do what you are not doing. Vanderkar added that he hadn t heard the city taking any action regarding the Armory, referring to an abandoned structure that sits off Ray Lawyer Drive near the El Dorado County Fairgrounds that several residents have opined would make a good homeless shelter. And the seemingly tireless Vanderkar, whose letters to the editor have run in the Mountain Democrat for years regarding helping the homeless, said he would hope city officials will remember the success of Hangtown Haven. That legally organized campground that began in July of 2012 housed a homeless population along Broadway, and was lauded as a marked success. Some contended it was too successful, however, alleging that the experimental campground was attracting homeless from outside the area and not serving only the local populace. Hangtown Haven was shut down in November of 2013 when the City Council denied its request for an extension of the temporary order allowing its existence. Despite its success at providing a stable locale where those down on their luck could take advantage of programs and opportunities, with several success stories resulting, complaints from neighbors and from the police at that time swayed the council to close down the camp (the council did allow one extension, but said no to a second). County officials then were approached regarding providing an alternative site that did not materialize. Hangtown Haven Inc. still exists, advised Vanderkar, and would be willing to work with the city on resurrecting such a venture, he indicated. The longtime champion for the homeless then delivered an apology, saying he may have been a bit harsh in making his points. I am known to be a soft spoken, kind and politically correct person, he began. However, I am tired, having volunteered (recently) at the nomadic shelter, which makes me more sarcastic than usual. But over the past 10 years many homeless have died in this city we have had memorial services for them, he continued. Perhaps the city could help us with those memorial services. City officials assured Vanderkar and the crowd that the possibility of turning the Armory into a shelter for the homeless has been examined, but at this point it seems more logical to eye the site for construction of affordable housing, a longer term answer to a problem that is growing every day. City staff has been working on procuring grants and other funding mechanisms that would advance such a project there, and in fact city officials said they have met with two developers who are interested in the site. Another speaker who often takes the podium to advocate for the homeless, Jonathan Gainsbrugh, told the council that the camping ordinance they were primed to pass still remains illegal, in his opinion. Gainsbrugh said designating three areas where camping may occur, when there are no shelters available, does not make the city compliant with the Boise decision. Despite its micro changes, (the ordinance) continues to illegally restrict hours and locations for the homeless to be, said Gainsbrugh, who added that changing the language to allow camping from sundown to 8 a. m. (formerly it was 8 p. m. to 8 a. m. ) does not do the trick either. (The city s ordinance) is not only unworkable, but totally contrary to the 9th District Federal Court s decision regarding criminalizing and criminally restricting homeless persons camping and activities, said Gainsbrugh. It does not matter what the city attorney s opinion on the matter is. During last week s meeting the council authorized the city to continue to contribute to the funding of a countywide homeless coordination effort, approving 10,000 to go into a pot that pays for the services of HomeBase, a private company, among other irons in the fire. The city entered into an agreement in 2018 with the county to contribute a share and the county asked that city funding be provided again this year. Council members stressed that the city is pushing forward with efforts to come up with solutions to the vexing problems presented by the homeless, although it is admittedly slow going. It is a painfully slow process that we have to go through to get more money, said Councilman Dennis Thomas. But it s what we need to do it will pay off eventually. Thomas said efforts by law enforcement, including the Homeless Outreach Team have been very successful, but that it s not overly apparent to most that progress is being made, especially when the homeless are visibly growing in number around them. Not seeing any diminishing in that reality and not seeing a shelter open its doors to house those in dire need, leaves them wondering what is being done, he pointed out. "
Hangtown,"Hangtown Proud Boys welcomed? EDITOR: Proud Boys toy drop off riles community, article by Thomas Frey, Mountain Democrat, Dec. 11. But the Hangtown Proud Boys members say they aren t racist the hand gesture means everything is OK. We are just a patriotic group of men I recently viewed a YouTube video from Access El Dorado featuring an impromptu interview with Placerville Chief of Police Joe Wren, who told the reporter that his talk with the Proud Boys left him with the opinion, They don t have any racial ideology. It s political ideology. They are not here to tear up the town, cause harm, he said. Not a hate organization. The Southern Poverty Law Center designated the Proud Boys a hate group. From the Washington Post, Dec. 13, there is this: Pro Trump rally descends into chaos as Proud Boys roam D. C. looking to fight. With Proud Boys taking on the Hangtown brand, and sporting the noose sign much like the city of Placerville does with its noose logo, these images are emboldened and the Proud Boys normalize themselves into the fabric of our community. Empowered by the fanfare, including spending quality time with Police Chief Wren, these celebrities in the news wear their hoodies with Hangtown Proud Boys and noose logos promoting their cause. Consider the image of a noose, clear in its intention to be used as a tool to threaten people. Does the community of Placerville want this kind of notoriety? Albert Einstein said, The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don t do anything about it. Does anyone want to speak out?

Wyleswood,"Berea Community Outreach anchors city’s help to residents: Community Voices BEREA, Ohio With the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic in March 2020, Berea Community Outreach became the go to resource for increasing numbers of Berea residents. BCO was one of the first projects started by Mayor Cyril Kleem when he took office in 2008. He saw it as reaching out to those in the shadows of the community, the ones that are often forgotten, he said. Living up to its motto lending a hand, making a difference Berea Community Outreach now encompasses a long list of programs, from a food pantry and Dinner to Your Door to grass cutting and snowplowing for seniors and the disabled. Natalie Guzzo, Berea Community Outreach coordinator, said requests for services have mushroomed in the past year. At the same time, we ve been getting a tremendous amount of donations since COVID, she said. When the first stimulus checks were mailed, many residents dropped off the funds at BCO. They told me they didn t need the money. We could put it to better use, Guzzo said. Local corporations have helped, too. Giant Eagle has donated bakery, food, soap, toilet paper and other supplies worth more than 30,000. Guzzo said the grocery store also gave BCO clients Halloween bags and decorations. Heinen s regularly drops off bread and bakery items worth more than 10,000 over the year. One of BCO s major programs is the Backpack Program for students at Grindstone Elementary School and Berea Midpark High School who might need nutritious food over the weekend. Credit First National Association, based in Brook Park, has donated all of the food items for the Backpack Program. The association also gave 10,000 for Christmas gifts and school supplies for BCO clients. The Backpack Program serves 55 students. School supplies were given to 65 students. Individuals, service organizations such as Berea Kiwanis and Berea Rotary, churches, school groups and other non profits donate cash, time and talent to make sure programs run smoothly. Dinner to Your Door delivers hot meals to 42 seniors, shut ins and disabled residents in Berea, Brook Park and Middleburg Heights. The meals are provided by a catering service and delivered by volunteers. About 180 families are served by the Food Pantry, which is open every Thursday. Easter and Thanksgiving meals were delivered to 100 residents at Quarrytown. Children were given Easter baskets. For Christmas, 110 children received gifts through BCO. BCO volunteers raked leaves for 75 seniors in November. BCO also supports the Active Senior Network and the Veterans Outreach Office. BCO works with the police department and other agencies to help those with mental health issues and those who may need housing assistance. All of this is accomplished as a non profit. BCO has raised more than 800,000 in cash and donations to support its programs. Program costs are supported 100 percent by donations. No tax dollars are used. BCO relies on the generosity of the community to continue helping our neighbors. Berea is such a great community because of our sense of family, and it s that sense of family that we rely on to support Berea Community Outreach, Kleem said. To support Berea Community Outreach, make checks payable to BCO and mail to 535 Wyleswood Drive, Berea, OH 44017. You also can donate on the city website, https://cityofberea. org/274/Berea Community Outreach. Non perishable food items can be dropped off weekdays between 9 a. m. and 4 p. m.

Yerwood,"“A Little Bit of Mercy...” — A Darien family's loss to addiction. William Pickering Jones III wanted to become a lawyer to help people. Law is a means for me to add a little bit of my own mercy, to make the world a little less cold and more just, My hope in pursuing a law degree, is to give back to help those without a voice, the marginalized, the disenfranchised, the neuro disabled, the poor, and all those who have struggled to be heard. Pope Francis said it well, In the fall of 2018, William, who was attending Fordham Law School, encountered a stranger suffering an overdose in the park adjacent to the school. Knowing what to do, he tried to take action by asking the school s security staff for Narcan, the common name for Naxalone, a medication used in overdose emergencies. The security guards didn t have it. However, William was able to call the police and give them the critical information needed to save the person s life. The experience led him to initiate efforts for Narcan training for Fordham Law students and staff. The story, in a letter received from one of William s classmates, sat within a seemingly endless pile of letters, cards, and remembrances on his parents kitchen table on a cold morning in February. The same kitchen table at which William s mother, Elizabeth Higgins Jones Betsy shared her last conversation with her only son on Dec. 25. Though he fought hard to beat it, William lost his battle with addiction on Christmas Day. He was 27. Despite his driving need and efforts to help others including saving someone s life the one person he couldn t save was himself. He fought valiantly every day, Betsy said. While at Fordham, William, along with the same classmate who wrote the letter, Lura Chamberlain, founded the Drug Policy Reform Group. Its stated purpose is to foster intellectual discussion, build community relationships, and support meaningful policy reform around legal and sociopolitical issues relating to the supply and demand of illegal, addictive, and/or consciousness altering substances: treatment options for substance users and harm reduction efforts on an individual, community, and national scale. I don t know many people who would rush to a stranger s aid without hesitation, and even fewer who can say they ve saved a life, Chamberlain wrote in her letter, but William was one of them. She added that the Narcan training that William started will continue to be pursued by the Drug Policy Reform Group in William s memory, both because of its crucial relationship to the group s objectives and because it represents the kind of simple, non discriminating compassion for others that William embodied so well. The Jones family is a private one. That is what makes talking to me about William difficult for Betsy. But his passionate need to help to change the world is what is encouraging her. That privacy meant that almost all of Betsy s and her husband Bill s friends and family were not aware of William s struggle with addiction. As a consequence, many were shocked when William died in December. The reason that the Jones family kept William s struggle private was because of the very stigma they are now speaking out against. They kept it quiet to protect William, so that any negative connotations would not follow him as he moved forward with his life so that he would not be defined by it, his mother said. However, Betsy said her family wanted to make it clear that William had died from a drug overdose by adding to his obituary that memorial donations were to be made to Shatterproof because as Betsy says, addiction is a disease, like any other it does not discriminate. Shatterproof is a national non profit organization based in Connecticut that is dedicated to helping families deal with their addicted loved ones. CEO Gary Mendell lost his son Brian to addiction. Betsy pointed out the ease and frequency with which physicians have prescribed opioids. She and her husband, believe that some of us are simply biologically predisposed to becoming quickly addicted to opioids. She said that when she was prescribed opioids, they made her sick to her stomach. When William was prescribed them, it was the beginning of his struggle. Background William and his three younger sisters, Julia, Catherine and Elizabeth, grew up in a lovely home in the Tokeneke section of Darien. William was aware of what he had, in terms of family, education, and economic stability, and also aware of what others didn t and wanted to help. In his personal statement, he describes recovering from a major concussion, he said, while playing lacrosse for McGill University. William took a medical leave from McGill after the concussion caused him to struggle academically and socially. Upon his return, he joined a McGill research project that studied worldwide population regarding how social determinants, such as race, income, and health care, impact children born with neuro disabilities specifically, how those factors impact the path of the child s life. I was not a bad person before all this. I grew up privileged, white, well educated, with supportive friends and a loving family. A nice, relatively normal childhood. But I was blind. I was sheltered. Things came easily to me. It was not until I had something major taken away that I truly knew how lucky I d been. I could now empathize, not just sympathize, he wrote. This caused William to reflect on his blessings and give him passionate purpose. He began volunteering for the Yerwood Center in Stamford, which provides after school tutoring to local elementary school students, many of whom are poor and minorities. And it was then that he decided he wanted to be a lawyer. A public health crisis According to Shatterproof, in 2017, 70,237 Americans died from drug overdoses. On average, drug overdoses now kill 192 Americans per day. Darien resident Holly Jespersen, who serves as Shatterproof s senior communications manager, says one of the organization s main goals is to remove the stigma and shame of addiction. Part of the reason for the rise in addiction and overdoses, Jespersen says, is because those who suffer from dependence on opioids, when unable to access prescribed meds, are buying them on the street. Often, these street opioids are laced with fentanyl, which Jespersen says is a deadly combination literally. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) affirms that this is the worst drug overdose epidemic in U. S. history. And the problem has grown so severe that, in 2014, the CDC added prescription drug overdose prevention to its list of the top five public health challenges. Three Illnesses and deaths related to substance use disorders are at epidemic levels right now, and it s quickly getting worse. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that in 2017, there were 955 overdose deaths involving opioids in Connecticut a rate of 27.7 deaths per 100,000 people, which is twofold higher than the national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100,000 people. The greatest increase in opioid deaths was see in cases involving synthetic opioids (mainly fentanyl): a rise from 79 deaths in 2016 to 686 in 2017. Deaths involving heroin also increased from 98 deaths in 2012 to 450 in 2016 but saw a decrease in 2017 to 425 deaths. Prescription opioids were involved in 273 deaths in 2017, a more than fourfold increase from 60 in 2012. In October 2017, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Darien First Selectman Jayme Stevenson has made fighting opioid addiction one of her priorities. While running for Lieutenant Governor last spring and summer, she offered that if elected she would make it a priority to have that office take leadership of the crisis. The Stamford Advocate recently reported a growing list of defendants in the torrent of litigation against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma extends beyond the firm s owners. While the eight members of the Sackler family figure most prominently among the accused, Connecticut s expanded lawsuit filed recently and a similar complaint from Massachusetts highlight the crucial role of four current and former executives in carrying out the alleged fraudulent marketing of the firm s opioids. Purdue has denied Connecticut s and Massachusetts allegations, as well as those in the lawsuits filed by more than 1,000 other states and cities. Supervised injection facilities Last fall, William wrote a legal paper about the legal obstacles to creating supervised injection facilities in the United States. They are a place where intravenous users of opioids can inject in the presence of medical professionals who can administer lifesaving treatment if needed. SIFs represent a promising public health intervention with the potential to make a real impact on the opioid epidemic, William Jones, paper on legal obstacles for supervised injection facilities in the United States for Health Law Biomedical Ethics. Though acknowledging that some communities are concerned about increases in drug related crime or substance misuse if these are put in place, William wrote that international evidence shows the opposite its true. As far as the tested United States legality of SIFs, William wrote that first, one courageous city or state will need to open the first SIF. Until then, the ultimate legality remains unclear. At the back of his paper, William dedicated it to all our loved ones lost to this terrible epidemic, and quoted Robert Frost s poem Nothing Gold Can Stay, which concludes, Then leaf subsides to leaf so Eden sank to grief so dawn goes down to day Nothing gold can stay. Reflecting Betsy Jones says the Jones family all has strong opinions and debates could be lively. In these moments, William explained his passionate viewpoint to help others. He taught us something, he made us better, she said. Matthew Diller, dean of Fordham Law School, who spoke at the memorial service at Fordham Law School, attended by nearly 500 called William a natural leader and said that in one of his first conversations with William, he spoke of his motivation to get into law. The memorial service was held before a panel discussion on supervised injection sites that was planned by William and the Drug Policy Reform Group. He spoke about his hopes to help others, and said he believed that by helping one person at a time, he could make the world a better place, Diller said. Betsy also spoke at the Fordham Law School service. Many of you knew William growing up and many of you knew him here as a Fordham Law student you knew him here as Will. What many of you did not know, and sadly all know now, is that William struggled with and lost his battle to addiction. What many of you still do not know is how hard William fought. William told me that he fought every day against his addiction, his enemy, she said. What is extraordinary to us his family, was to learn that William, while working hard at law school, working hard to help those less fortunate through the initiatives he was passionate about, at the same time he was doing all of that, he was fighting his own battle, Betsy said. Vera T. Bullock, the assistant dean of Fordham Law School, gave a eulogy at William s Darien funeral in December, attended by nearly 800. In it, Bullock, with whom William had a close relationship, said she had shared with him that she had lost her son to a drug overdose. She told William that what she missed most were her son s hugs. After that, without fail, William made a point of stopping by my office several times a week. He would come in and simply say time for a hug, Bullock said. That simple gesture sums up to me William s philosophy of life. He always left a conversation, a situation and now the world a better place, she said. Bullock also said when times were stressful they would talk about the things they were grateful for and gave an example. William said that he was grateful for a strong turnout for the Rally for Lifesaving Treatment in Prisons Jails that he organized or that the model of a Riker s solitary confinement cell that he had helped to build on the 3rd floor had interested people in the conditions of the incarcerated. Boy did he help me put my life in perspective, she said. If there was anyone who could understand William s journey, it was his close friend growing up in Darien, who bravely fought cancer for over ten years. This courageous young man was an inspiration to William and to everyone who knew him. A quote from a letter to his friend from William after they hadn t seen each for quite some time was on the back of the program at William s funeral. Our paths may have diverged, but I feel as though we were also running parallel. We were never as far apart as our perceptions may have suggested. And now that these paths have converged, I doubt they will ever diverge again. If they do, the gap is in our minds. Sadly, his dear friend passed away in March, two months after William. Betsy, Bill, Julia, Catherine and Elizabeth are devastated. Betsy and her family find comfort believing that they did everything they could for William but she also said: The tragedy in all of this is that William was such a good person who was trying to do good. He owned his mistakes. Sometimes, a mother s love isn t enough William received all the love, all the support and all the best medical and psychological care that we as a family could possibly give and William was so grateful for it, his family said. He told us over and over how grateful he was of us standing by him. William wanted to beat it his addiction but sadly his addiction beat him, they said. He didn t want this, Betsy added. As Betsy recalled her last conversation with William at that same kitchen table gesturing to where he sat that night she said that she was grateful that they had the chance to share that moment. Nothing was left unsaid, she said. In her speech at Fordham Law, Betsy spoke of that last conversation adding that he made me a better person. William made all of us better because he made us all aware. We are so proud of William so proud of his humanity. On Christmas Eve, just before William died, I had the chance to say what I wanted to say, what I needed to say, she said. I am so proud of you, William. Look how far you have come. I love you so much, she told him. I love you too, Mom I m so proud of you, he responded. Fordham Law School s Public Interest Resource Center named William P. Jones, III Public Interest 2L Student of the Year in recognition of his volunteer work, his leadership, and inspiration to others to become involved in public service. Moving mountains ""Barn's burnt down now I can see the moon. "" haiku by Mizuta Masahide, a favorite haiku of William s. Betsy Jones and her family hope by sharing William s story, it will carry on his passionate commitment to help others and continuing his fervent hope to make a change. As Betsy said in an email to The Darien Times, The time for drug policy reform and early intervention is now. All of us must become educated in order to dispel the shame and disgrace that surrounds our addicted loved ones and their families. William s law school statement underlines this sentiment in his realistic optimism for the future, if we all pitch in. It was his belief that even the most unsurmountable such as conquering the pain, the epic loss, and the stigma of opioid addiction could be done as a united effort of humanity. Instead of moving a mountain, I am trying to move a pebble I care about if we all move our pebbles, we can move mountains, William Jones, in his law school admissions personal statement. The Jones family hopes that by telling William s story, they can help at least one person avoid what happened to their wonderful son and bring awareness about this terrible epidemic. They thank the Darien Police Department and Darien Post 53 for their quick response on Christmas morning and for their gentle respect and kindness. The Jones family would also like to thank their friends, family and the Darien community for their love and support. "
Alphawood,"Chicago can better protect its historic architecture with a new survey of old buildings While the Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS) was well intentioned, giving it the nostalgic treatment in a recent article a veneration of the days when preservationists drove around in a Chevette, unknowingly determining the fate of thousands of historic buildings takes away from what it represents: a policy failure. Historic preservation deals in the past, but methodologies change as values change. Data cannot age four decades and still be used as a planning tool. We lack a matrix to protect buildings because we are still using the CHRS as a benchmark. Using the aged CHRS also defies the Landmarks Ordinance, which dictates an ongoing survey of the City of Chicago for the purpose of identifying those areas, districts, places, buildings, structures, art, and other objects of historic or architectural significance. SEND LETTERS TO: letters suntimes. com. Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes. We need a new survey. With the Department of Planning and Development seeking to reverse disinvestment and make our city more affordable, reevaluating the value of historic buildings can bridge a gap. The most affordable building is the one that already exists, with our venerable architecture serving as naturally occurring, affordable stock for businesses, renters, homeowners and developers. A new survey could link building type to other data, like the Department of Housing s community level count of affordable housing units. A new survey could create proactive preservation strategies, and would rely on GIS technology and apps instead of color coded paper maps. The 11 year long CHRS fluctuated based on funding, but with the proper backing, a new survey would take a quarter of that time. Original funders like the MacArthur and Graham Foundations are still assisting built environment oriented projects, as do newer grant makers, like the Alphawood and Driehaus Foundations. Along with city, state and national backing, a new survey is possible. Most important, the impact would be felt on our streets. A new survey would give neighborhood architecture acknowledgement and protection, providing opportunities for restoration and development a tangible gift that keeps on giving. Elizabeth A. Blasius, architectural historian, Blaservations, Inc. Nothing wrong with ride hailing tax Laura Washington is wrong to criticize the city s new ride hailing tax. Since Uber and Lyft have decimated the taxi industry and taken its customers, they should also assume the financial obligations. Now idle taxicabs paid the city tens of millions of dollars in fees, taxes, fines and motor fuel taxes. How else can we fund all the wonderful progressive programs Ms. Washington supports? If ride share costs are too much, the CTA is still a bargain at 2.50. Michael Sullivan, Belmont "
Dollywood,"Dollywood's response to song lawsuit: Yeah, we used it, but we did nothing wrong Lee Mendelson Film Productions Inc. filed the suit against the Pigeon Forge theme park in October, alleging copyright infringement. PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. Yes, we used it. No, we don't use it anymore. And, no, we did nothing wrong. That's the essence of Dollywood's response this month to a federal lawsuit filed by Lee Mendelson Film Productions Inc. in U. S. District Court in Knoxville. Mendelson filed suit in October, alleging the park improperly used without permission the song ""Christmastime is Here"" in its annual ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" production. It seeks up to 150,000 in compensation. Written by pianist Vince Guaraldi with lyrics by Lee Mendelson, the song is featured in the Christmas classic ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", which came out in 1965 and airs every December. Mendelson also alleges the music was used without a license for dramatic rights at various shows at Dollywood's other properties such as the DreamMore Resort. The lawsuit claims Dollywood was notified about the alleged infringement in September 2018. In its response filed Dec. 16, Dollywood states that it stopped using the song in 2018. It acknowledges it may have started using it as far back as 2007. But Dollywood says it had a license to use the song. It also claims the usage was not dramatic and doesn't infringe on Mendelson's ownership. The park, founded more than 30 years ago by Sevier County native Dolly Parton, is asking a judge to toss the lawsuit and make Mendelson cover its legal expenses to fight it. "
Dollywood,"'Once a Playmate, Always a Playmate,' 40 years after my centerfold, I posed for another Playboy feature It was always Hugh Hefner s (Hef s) mantra, Once a Playmate, always a Playmate, and I felt the full force of this after I was asked to fly to L. A. for another shoot for Playboy magazine a full 40 years after appearing as its December 1979 centerfold. The request, obviously, caught me completely off guard since I didn t expect to be modeling for Playboy after all these years. My journey with the organization began way back in 1974 when I first became a Bunny at the St. Louis Playboy Club. My first photo shoot, shortly after being hired, was for a Best Bunnies pictorial. It caught the attention of the home office in Chicago and I was quickly invited to transfer to the hub, which I did, moving into the storied Playboy Mansion on State Street on September 22, 1974. Two years ago, Cooper Hefner invited me to reprise my February 1979 cover for another feature for the magazine that included six other iconic Playmates his mother, Kimberly Conrad Hefner (Playmate of the Year 1989, Jan. 1988 Playmate) Rene Tenison (PMOY 1990, Nov. 1989 PM) Lisa Matthews (PMOY 1991, April 1990 PM) Charlotte Kemp Muhl (December 1982 PM) Cathy St. George (August 1982 PM) and Monique St. Pierre (PMOY 1979, November 1978 PM). This most recent shoot was a complete departure of anything I ve ever done for Playboy before. It included Renee Tenison (the first African American PMOY, 1990, November 1989 PM who also appeared in the cover reprisal shoot Victoria Valentino (September 1963 Playmate who was a Cosby victim and now the oldest PM to ever appear in the magazine at age 77) Raquel Pomplun (the first Mexican/ American PMOY, 2013, and the April 2012 Playmate) and Brande Roderick (PMOY 2001 and April 2000 PM). The issue celebrates five decades of Playmates, a first for the magazine! I was invited to participate via an email that arrived on October 9, just after Chuck and I had returned from a trip to Dollywood where I had eaten my way through every fried food stand there. Waist wise, the timing couldn t have been worse but I shaped up in time and was fully prepared by the time I arrived in LA on October 21. The 12 page cover feature was shot by Nadia Lee Cohen, a cool, edgy female photographer who also serves as her own muse on her Instagram account. She s a contributing photog for Vogue mag too. Her surreal vision for the shoot came as a surprise to me and several others. It involved a step back in time, the swingin 60s, when wigs were big (literally and figuratively). Nadia s crack styling team was on top of it all. (Luckily though, I convinced Nadia to let me ditch the wig, which she kindly did. ) Looooonnngggg fake nails were glued onto everyone s hands and looooonnngggg eyelashes were applied. Heavy eye makeup was the order of the day as were the aforementioned wigs. Downstairs, racks and racks of vintage clothing, underwear, heels, jewelry and more were strewn across every spare surface. We were instructed to get spray tans before we came. Nadia mentioned during the shoot that she was aiming for something like a Valley of the Dolls vibe which involved pretty serious wigs. I wasn t overly pleased to hear this but, in the end, her vision just rocked and made history for Playboy. The venue was a house in Burbank that was once owned by Esther Williams, the iconic swim star from the 40s/ 50s. It s vintage vibe had never been touched as witnessed by the throwback wooden features and overall mustiness. An orange shag carpet had been brought in to add more authenticity to the era. There was a pool in back, of course, and a guest house that served as the staging area for wardrobe, hair and makeup. It was a BIG shoot, lots and lots of crew and even a dog wrangler for two cute pups who seemed to want to be anywhere else but where they were. I just loved reconnecting with the Playmates and was happy to meet the new guard at Playboy magazine. They were enthusiastic and very respectful of the past yet with a firm eye on the future. I was so honored to be one of the Playmates chosen for this cover feature representing five decades of Playmates. As photographer Nadia Lee Cohen explained, I wanted to celebrate the original Playmates who helped shape and pioneer the brand. Just as Hefner always wanted when he coined the phrase and title of the feature Once a Playmate, Always a Playmate.

Dollywood,"Mayville's youngest kids to receive free books MAYVILLE A love of reading may be instilled in Mayville s youngest residents as Dolly Parton s Imagination Library comes to town. The free to the family program will send a book each month to children under the age of 5 living in the Mayville zip code. Mayville is one of 19 communities throughout Wisconsin to take part in the program. Laura Honish, a reading specialist at Parkview Primary, said she learned of the program six years ago while participating in a Literacy Leaders Network in Oshkosh. We re always looking for opportunities to help our youngest students because we see gaps in students knowledge sometimes, she said. We notice with incoming 4 and 5 year olds, that some kids don t have all their letters and sounds. And some don t know a book works by reading from left to right or they don t understand that the pages go in order to tell a story. Honish said she thought the program would be a great way to positively impact reading readiness skills and signed on to be a local champion for the Imagination Library. According to the program s website, Dolly Parton founded and launched her Imagination Library in 1995 in Sevier County, Tennessee, where she grew up. In 2000, a national replication effort began. The program is currently available in the United States, Australia, Canada, Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom. More than 130 million books have been distributed throughout the program s history. Parton created the program as a tribute to her father, who didn t know how to read. Honish said The Dollywood Foundation determines how much money is needed to get the program started in an area based on census statistics. It was suggested 5,000 of community support was necessary to supply books over a five year period. I wasn t very successful at first in finding funding sources, but I kept trying and then partnered with Susan Jentz from the United Way of Dodge County and she was a great person to network with, she said. In addition to the United Way, supporters include Alliant Energy, Mayville Lions Club, Mayville Rotary Club and Walmart. The Imagination Library team in Mayville consists of Honish Jentz Sheila Steger, the children s librarian at Mayville Public Library Amber Schraufnagel, of The Open Door Coffeehouse and Lori Gutzmann, reading specialist at Parkview Primary. They are community members who really have a lot of connections to families in Mayville, Honish said. I ve learned if you start small, others will come on board because they want to be part of it, too. Having more people get involved brings about the real feeling of it being a great community project. Registration for the program started in mid December and currently 30 children are signed up. The program is available to all children under age five, regardless of income. Responsibilities of the family include: Be a resident of Mayville zip code 53050 Submit an official registration form, completely filled out by an authorized adult. Notify Laura Honish any time your address changes. Books are mailed to the address listed on the account. If the child s address changes, Honish must be told for the child to continue receiving books. Read with your child and have fun. Honish provides the registration data base to the program s foundation and, eight to 10 weeks after the registration form has been received, books will begin arriving at the child s home and will continue until the child turns five or moves out of the covered area. Dolly Parton s Imagination Library selects high quality age appropriate books for each child. So if a child is signed up right away at birth, by the time they are age five they will have a 60 volume library of their very own, Honish said. Registration is ongoing for the next five years for those who live within the 53050 zip code. For more information, contact Sheila Steger at the Mayville Public Library at 920 387 7910, or Laura Honish at Parkview Primary at 920 387 7973. Eventually we would like to incorporate other zip codes in the school district and perhaps all of Dodge County. We ll see, it s a good start and provides a big boost toward a child s education, Honish said. Follow Kelly Simon on Twitter KSchmidSimon or contact her at 920 356 6757.

Disney World or Disneyland: which mega theme park is best for you? Photo by Joshua Sudock/Disneyland Resort Article content It s the time of the year when many Canadians are plotting a trip south of the border and if you ve got a family (or even if you don t) that trip may revolve around, or at least include a visit to, a theme park. While Harry Potter fanatics may be drawn to Universal Studios and country music lovers might have their eye on Dollywood, for many of us, Disney remains the top choice for theme park vacations. Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content If you ve never been to a Disney park before, know that the company really does set the standard when it comes to an all encompassing experience. Many a Disney cynic has been instantaneously converted as they walk through the front gates of any Disney park. Despite long lines and overtired kids, Disney somehow has figured out how to engineer legitimate joy the combination of the music, the cleanliness, the creativity of the rides and the exuberance of the characters sets the scene for authentically good moods. It s an odd and sometimes unexpected phenomenon, and the reason why so many people who don t even have children flock to Disney parks all over the world. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Disney World or Disneyland: which mega theme park is best for you? Back to video North Americans have two convenient choices for that Disney experience: Disney World in Orlando, Florida and the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Most Canadians choose their park based on which side of the country they re flying in from, but it s important to note that there are some big differences between the two properties. Size and Scope Photo by Disney World Disney World is far bigger than Disneyland. Each site has multiple parks: there are six parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney s Hollywood Studios and Disney s Animal Kingdom, as well as two water parks) at Disney World and only two at Disneyland (the original Disneyland as well as California Adventure Park). One could conceivably go to Disneyland for just one day and hit most of the highlights at both parks, which are just across the street from each other, whereas doing all of Disney World in one day (or even over the course of several days) is impossible, both because of the number of parks and the distance between them. Strictly speaking, the main parks Disneyland (California) and The Magic Kingdom (Florida) are fairly similar, albeit with different layouts. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Going from park to park requires either separate admission tickets or a costly park hopper pass, so no matter which resort you choose it s important to do some research and decide which attractions are of most interest so that you can plan your days and also buy the appropriate tickets. The enormity of Disney World can be overwhelming to navigate and those who have younger children or just crave simplicity may prefer the less is more approach of Disneyland. Hotels Photo by Matt Stroshane/Disney World The scope of the two parks also means that Disney World is positioned as a self contained resort, whereas Disneyland is more integrated into downtown Anaheim. Disneyland only has three affiliated hotels, though there are plenty of other hotels within walking distance from the park gates. Anaheim is also a relatively short drive from Los Angeles and the coastal beach communities, so it s possible to make a Disney day trip part of a larger California vacation without switching hotels. Disney World, on the other hand, features more than 20 on site resort hotels that offer a truly immersive Disney experience. Guests can stay at an African themed lodge that overlooks exotic animals, Polynesian style villas, old school Florida beach clubs or other fantastical options. Staying on park at both Disney World and Disneyland usually comes with perks like early entrance to the parks. Vibe Photo by Scott Brinegar/Disneyland When it comes down to it, your Disney park preference is going to come down to time, how much you re willing to spend, and personality. On paper, Disney World is bigger, more exciting, and offers a more well rounded vacation, but once you factor in all the days it takes to fully explore the four parks (and possibly the water parks) and the cost of staying on site, it is a fairly significant commitment. But if you want to go full Disney, it s the best bet. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Even when you factor in the adjacent California Adventure Park, Disneyland is much more manageable, but as the original Disney park, it s also got a very appealing nostalgic vibe that the Magic Kingdom hasn t been able to replicate. The old school attractions like It s a Small World and the Mad Tea Party are essentially the same at both main parks, but Disneyland just feels more quaint. For many Disneyland fanatics, that intangible is what makes all the difference. More On This Topic Wandering around West Hollywood Why it's worth road tripping from Western Canada to your U.

Dollywood,"Storyteller’s performance focuses on unforeseen challenges The sharp toothed creatures swimming beneath the murky water could be the ruin of them all. When storyteller Beth Horner took over operation of her family s 700 acre farm, she faced a number of unexpected and unforeseen challenges. That included trouble raised posed by a certain aquatic mammal infestation in the farm s lake beavers. sc:text divider text divider title Story continues below gallery What was I going to do with all of these beavers? Beavers are not happy little cute creatures. They re big, and they can destroy, she said. My story is a metaphor for this who signed me up for this? The experience of operating the farm, as well as other examples from her life, form the basis of Horner s storytelling performance, Who Signed Me Up For This? At the heart of the story, it s a humorous and poignant look at what happens when life takes you on unexpected journeys you couldn t possibly be prepared for. Horner will showcase the performance during a special virtual show by Storytelling Arts of Indiana at 7 p. m. Saturday. For those who tune in, she hopes that the show provides a measure of escape during a particularly unusual time for us all. This program is very funny, but is speaks to life s unexpected events, and how to persevere and get through them, she said. I hope they take a break from life and have a lot of laughs and some inspiration to keep them going. Horner is renowned throughout the country for her ability to spin a yarn and connect to an audience. She is a National Storytelling Network 2007 Circle of Excellence Oracle Award winner and performed multiple times at the National Storytelling Festival. She was featured on Live From National Geographic, at the International Art of Storytelling Festival, the Starlight Educational Foundation of Taiwan and was included in Lyrics Lore: A Weekend with Songwriters Storytellers at Dollywood s DreamMore Resort. For her, storytelling is in her blood. Her grandmother greatly influenced her with folktales and fairy tales she d tell them when she visited from St. Louis to Horner s family farm in Boone County, Missouri. In addition, her father is a natural storyteller. I grew up with his stories of various characters of Boone County, and various ancestors, of both good and ill repute, she said. We know, of course, that the ones of ill repute are much better stories. But Horner never anticipated that storytelling could be anything more than a hobby. An initial interest in theater segued into a career as a children s librarian, where she was giddy at the prospect of spending her time telling stories to children. While earning her master s degree in library science, one of her professor s introduced her to the National Storytelling Festival, an annual celebration of the storytelling arts held every fall in Jonesborough, Tennessee. She is the person I learned that there were people making their living traveling around telling stories, she said. When I learned about the National Storytelling Festival, of course I had to go. Horner worked for several years as a librarian before deciding at age 30 to launch into storytelling full time. She s been doing it ever since. One of the delights of her job is that Horner never knows where it might lead her. Stories have led her into the past, with performances inspired by her great great grandfather s Civil War diary. She has explored the story of Li Chi, an empowering warrior from Chinese folklore. Through storytelling, she had an opportunity to work on four projects with NASA, after the space agency asked her to help collect the stories from the scientists behind the Apollo space missions. I was approached for those projects because someone at NASA heard me tell a story about sewage, and she said to me, We think that if you can make sewage entertaining, you can make space science entertaining, she said. I never knew when I was telling stories to preschoolers that this would branch out into so many different possibilities. Horner s stories are drawn from a wide range of source material, crafted and shaped with her own sense of humor. Early on, she discovered that adding musical elements to the performances could enhance and strengthen the words she was using. Over the years, I ve realized that the combination of music and story works really well, she said. I m not an accomplished musician, and would never make my living solely from music, but I add a little here and there. The idea behind Who Signed Me Up For This? comes from Horner s own life. The performance is composed of two stories, the first of which focuses on her father and his life s passion. That is followed by tales of the unforeseen, including the beavers on her family s farm. Life takes you on unexpected journeys, for which you couldn t possibly be prepared, she said. Horner worked with Ellen Munds, director of Storytelling Arts of Indiana, to put together the Indianapolis performance. As they were planning the program early in 2020, they decided on Who Signed Me Up For This? even before the pandemic wreaked havoc on our lives. But the theme of the story is even more appropriate than ever, Horner said. Even though the story is from my experience, it s definitely something that everyone has experienced in their own lives, she said. They might not have experienced beavers, but they ve definitely had something handed to them and they go, What? What is this? And all of us are living this during this time in our history. sc:pullout title pullout title If you go sc:pullout text begin Who Signed Me Up For This?

Dollywood,"Tennessee-based bank opens in Innsbrook with new Richmond brand Armed with a veteran investor and a small, but well capitalized Tennessee bank, John Presley has put the band back together in Richmond. From an office in Innsbrook, Presley and a group of six employees in recent weeks launched Southern Community Bank, an offshoot of Tennessee based Sevier County Bank created specifically to serve as a new bank for the Richmond market. It s the third new bank Presley has helped launch locally, having previously served as founding CEO of the former First Market Bank and First Capital Bank, both of which were eventually acquired. He s now executive chairman of Sevier County Bank, a 400 million institution based in Sevierville, Tennessee, known for being the hometown of Dolly Parton and her Dollywood amusement park. The group is essentially using Sevier County Bank s charter to launch a from scratch brand in Richmond. While the two brands will operate under one umbrella, they ll be distinct brands in distinct markets, helping Sevier County Bank to deploy its capital in a broader, more diverse regional economy. Presley said the move is about as close as one can get to starting a new bank from the ground up without having to go through the onerous and expensive task of gaining a new bank charter. We had the capital to do it and it looked like the most cost effective way to start a bank in Richmond using the existing charter that we already had, he said. Getting a new charter is a very expensive thing to do, costing on average around 2 million, Presley said. This crossed that T if you will. Sevier County Bank is backed by majority investor Ken Lehman, who also is no stranger to the Richmond banking scene. Lehman is majority owner of Midlothian based Village Bank and made a hefty return as Henrico based First Capital Bank s largest shareholder when it was acquired in 2016 by what was then Park Sterling Bank out of Charlotte. Presley and Lehman, who have worked on other bank deals in other states, were brought into Sevier County Bank in 2019 to help turn it around. They quickly raised 18 million in fresh capital and brought it back to health. The on the ground work for Southern Community Bank is being done by a group of six, all but one of whom worked with Presley at First Market and First Capital and all whom came over from locally based Virginia Commonwealth Bank, which is soon to be absorbed by Blue Ridge Bank out of Charlottesville. Leading SCB s efforts here is Matt Paciocco, who most recently left a commercial banking position at VCB. Presley said Paciocco, 39, joined him at First Market right out of college and came with him to First Capital. We knew our market leader needed to be someone up and coming with a lot of energy, Presley said. Andy Ferguson, formerly chief credit officer at VCB as well as at First Market and First Capital, will lead the bank s credit efforts in Richmond. Following them over from VCB is Bill Bien, who will serve as SCB s senior lending officer Bonnie Howle, head of treasury services and one of the first employees at First Market loan servicing manager Terry Richards and credit analyst Natalie Wilson. Wilson was the only one of the group who hadn t previously worked with Presley at First Market or First Capital. Another reason we felt comfortable doing this is we know the bankers and we know the customers and have someone on the team that knows the credit in Richmond, Presley said. We believe we can build a 100 million portfolio in a relatively short time with these six individuals. SCB has set up shop at 4421 Cox Road, just up the street from First Capital s former headquarters. The Innsbrook office is up and running and already funding loans. It is finalizing the process to be able to accept deposits beginning this spring. Sevier County Bank s Richmond intentions first came to light last summer, when it was considering opening a branch on Patterson Avenue in Richmond s West End. That deal has since been taken off the table and Presley said they now are looking at several branch options in the area, with an eye on the West End, Southside and one closer to the city. We want to find the right one or two or maybe three, Presley said. When we started First Market, within three to four years we had 31 branches and a headquarters. At that time you needed that footprint. Today, with the abundance of technology, you can service your customers from just about anywhere. They chose the Southern Community Bank name mainly for its initials, which correspond nicely with Sevier County Bank. We ll use SCB heavily when we re out doing business, Presley said. While pairing banks in Richmond and Sevierville, Tennessee, doesn t exactly make sense when looking at a map, Presley said he and Lehman chose Richmond because of their knowledge of the market and the need to put all that capital to work. The dominos really began to fall when the VCB/Blue Ridge deal was announced, freeing up Ferguson, Paciocco and the gang to make a move. SCB has liquidity approaching 100 million, Presley said. We re in a part of Tennessee that s heavily based in tourism and we were looking at ways to deploy the excess cash and possibly diversify the portfolio. And things just fell into place. As for SCB s growth plans in Richmond, Presley said it s a work in progress and that folks shouldn t read too much into Lehman s connections to Village Bank and any possible ideas of a marriage there. If we grow a 100 million bank in Richmond with this team, we know that s going to be really successful. Where it goes after, I don t know, he said. Presley, now on his third time opening a bank in Richmond, said while it may be his last go around, it s allowing him to relive some of his more memorable days in the industry. I just turned 60 last year. As you get to the end of your career you start to look back on things that were the most fun and certainly it was starting First Market and First Capital, he said. Doing it one more time is going to be fun. "
Dollywood,"An Unheard Dolly Parton Song's Under Lock and Key at the DreamMore Resort Until 2045 Dolly Parton's book Songteller: My Life in Lyrics tells of an unheard song recorded for the 2015 opening of Dollywood's DreamMore Resort and Spa and kept under lock and key until 2045. ""It would be a song that will never be heard until 30 years from the time we opened the resort. They said, 'You'll be long dead,'"" Parton writes. ""I said, 'Well, maybe not. I'll be 99. I've seen people live to be older than that. '"" The song's on a CD stored in a chestnut wood box created by her uncle Bill, and the box resides in a glass case. There's also a CD player in the box, just in case that technology becomes even more scarce in the coming decades. ""That's like burying one of my kids, putting it on ice or something, and I won't be around to see it brought back to life,"" Parton adds. ""It's just burning me up inside that I have to leave it in there. "" Advertisement Parton's Dollywood theme park opened in 1986 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

Owlwood,"Carla House tied to Ponzi schemer Robert Shapiro sells Five Southern California properties once owned by convicted real estate Ponzi schemer Robert Shapiro have sold for a total of 69.1 million, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One of the properties is the Carla House, a 20,500 square foot Beverly Hills home designed by Noah Walker, that sold for 35 million. A liquidation entity for Shapiro s Woodbridge Group of Companies sold four residences in Beverly Hills and a small office building in Los Angeles, according to the SEC documents, first spotted by Bisnow. The SEC documents did not reveal the buyers or break down how much each property sold for. The Beverly Hills properties that sold include the Carla House at 1966 Carla Ridge a four bedroom home at 375 Trousdale Place as well as an adjacent lot at 385 Trousdale and 9230 Robin Drive, a 0.95 acre residential site. The Los Angeles property is 8124 West 3rd Street, a 9,100 square foot office building. Compass Sally Forster Jones and her colleague Tomer Fridman had the listing for Carla House, which was put on the market in July for 46 million, or about 2,300 a foot. The sale of the seven bedroom, nine bathroom house closed Dec. 27 for 35 million, or 1,750 a foot, according to Compass website. Jones couldn t be reached for comment, but on Dec. 28 she posted on her Instagram account regarding the deal. Was an absolute pleasure working on this architectural marvel, she wrote.

Shapiro pleaded guilty in August to orchestrating a 1.3 billion real estate Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded more than 7,000 investors, many of them elderly. Shapiro was sentenced to 25 years in prison in October. According to investigators, Woodbridge promised investors that their cash would be used to build and buy luxury properties that would yield high returns. Shapiro and the company were accused of instead buying properties through a web of legal entities to obscure ownership. Investigators said properties and development sites worth hundreds of millions of dollars were purchased in Los Angeles and across the country, with Shapiro admitting that he misappropriated between 25 million and 95 million in investor funds. Among the properties was the historic Owlwood Estate, a 12,200 square foot home that Shapiro bought for 90 million in 2016.

Slackwood,"Bobbitt passes the torch to Kownacki at Lawrence Township reorganization meeting There were smiles all around when three Lawrence Township Council members were sworn into office for four year terms and a new mayor was selected at the council s reorganization meeting on Jan. 1 at the Lawrence Township Municipal Building. Cathleen Lewis was sworn into office for her third term, when Michael Powers was sworn into office for his fourth term. The two were joined by John Ryan, who was appointed to fill out an unexpired term and who then won a full term in the November general election. All are Democrats. The Lawrence Township Police Department s honor guard marched into the township council meeting chambers, followed by Lewis, Powers and Ryan. The three council members elect took their seats on the dais, awaiting their formal swearing in. Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds Jackson swore in Lewis, and Assemblyman Anthony Verrelli swore in Ryan. Mercer County Surrogate Diane Gerofsky gave the oath of office to Powers. Once the newly constituted Lawrence Township Council members took their seats on the dais, it was time to select one of their own to serve a two year term in the ceremonial post of mayor. The mayor presides over the council meetings and signs documents, but has little day to day responsibility. Outgoing Mayor Christopher Bobbitt nominated council member Jim Kownacki to the ceremonial post. Kownacki served as mayor from 2012 13. Bobbitt described Kownacki as a strong, dedicated public servant. He is not one who looks for the limelight. At the Memorial Day parade and Veterans Day, he is always there, but he doesn t take the spotlight. One of the things that I admire about him is that he is humble, but he is a strong person. Kownacki will tell it like he means it. He will say his peace. He always says, We ll get through it, we ll figure it out and do what s best for the township,' Bobbitt said. The motion to elect Kownacki as mayor was unanimously approved. With his hand on the Bible and his wife and granddaughter at his side, Kownacki was sworn into office as mayor by Colonel Robert E. Watson. Mayor Kownacki thanked Bobbitt, Lewis, Powers and Ryan for giving him the chance to serve as mayor for the next two years. Some of those things they said about me don t believe it, Kownacki said as the audience chuckled. There is a lot happening in Lawrence Township, Kownacki said. There are some things in the works, but it is too soon to talk about them, he said. Lawrence Township is one of the best places to live, he said. It is a better town today than it was yesterday, and his goal is to make it a better town tomorrow than it is today. I know we can do it as a team, Kownacki said. In his first official act as mayor, he swore the township s three volunteer fire company fire chiefs into office Ken Kandrac of the Slackwood Volunteer Fire Co. , Wayne Hannon Jr. of the Lawrence Road Fire Co. and Ray Nagy of the Lawrenceville Fire Co. As is the custom during the Lawrence Township Council reorganization meeting, each council member was given a chance to make some comments. In his remarks, Powers congratulated Kownacki. He said the new mayor is a man who speaks from the heart. He served in the U. S. Marine Corps and brings that military discipline with him wherever he goes. I know you ll do a good job, Powers said. Powers also complimented Bobbitt, the former mayor, whose focus during his two year term was on sustainability. Lawrence Township earned silver status from Sustainable Jersey last year, which was due in large part to Bobbitt, he said. Turning to Lewis and Ryan, Powers said he is looking forward to working with them and Bobbitt and Kownacki as a team to move Lawrence Township forward. Lewis thanked the voters for their faith in her, and also thanked her family for their support and understanding of why it is important to invest in public service. Lewis said that she and her husband chose to raise their family in Lawrence Township because of the diversity they found in the town diversity of thought, of religion, of economics, of sexual orientation and of race. Too many times over the last year, we have had to declare that hate has no home here. As a community, we know that we value our differences and will stand up for our neighbors, Lewis said. Today, I am recommitting myself not just to respecting and encouraging diversity, but to find ways to understand my neighbors perspective. I am asking each of you to join me, she added. A couple of weeks ago, she spoke to her daughter s third grade class about what it s like to be an elected official and about the responsibility of citizenship. I told them the most important part of the job is to listen, to act in the best interests of the whole and not just yourself, and to be honest. I promise to listen, find common ground and to be open and transparent with our residents, Lewis said. Ryan thanked his family and supporters, and said it is an honor and a privilege to serve on the Lawrence Township Council. I promise to do my very best. We are moving Lawrence Township in the right direction. I promise to work hard for all of the residents, Ryan said. Bobbitt, who had flown home on a red eye flight from San Francisco, said he knows he is having a great vacation when it gets to the point that he wants to go home. Lawrence Township is my home now. Addressing the council members, Bobbitt said he is looking forward to working with them. He said he appreciates their collegiality. They each offer a different perspective, which helps the council to do some amazing things, he said. Let s get to work, Bobbitt said. "
Traverwood,"Google signs lease for old printing facility of The Ann Arbor News PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, MI Tech giant Google is quietly growing its footprint in Washtenaw County. The company signed a lease for a space at 5690 Hines Drive in Pittsfield Township, a Google spokesperson said in an email. It is unclear what the company plans to do with the space. The property formerly housed a printing facility for The Ann Arbor News and Jackson Citizen Patriot until Nov. 20, 2016. The facility closed when a contract with The New York Times expired and the printing of The Ann Arbor News and Jackson Citizen Patriot was moved to other Michigan facilities. Ann Arbor Offset to close Google in 2017 moved workers into a 135,000 square foot office space at 2300 Traverwood Drive. It previously housed employees in a downtown Ann Arbor space at the McKinley Towne Centre, at 505 E. Liberty and a site near Briarwood Mall. It originally operated out of a petite office in a space above Vinology on Main Street. The company also opened a 30,000 square foot office at 52 E. Henry St. inside Detroit s Little Caesars Arena in November 2018, moving some employees from Google s Birmingham office. Google has more than 600 employees across the state. The tech giant announced a 17 million investment across the region in June 2019, noting it planned capital improvements and expansions in its offices in Detroit and Ann Arbor. Once the expansions are completed, Google will occupy more than 260,000 square feet of space across Michigan.

Erkwood,"Henderson County News: City, developer try to reassure Hood Heights homeowners over sewer line City, developer try to reassure Hood Heights homeowners over sewer line Hood Heights Terry Gibbs makes a point during a meeting last week with a developer who is buying the Halfway Tree Mobile Home Park and officials with the city of Hendersonville. Weeks ago, homeowners in Hood Heights, a neighborhood of nine homes on a short dead end street off Erkwood Drive, watched with alarm as surveyors set up their transits and began taking land measurements. Their concern escalated when they read news reports a few days later that the city planned to condemn land for a sewer easement through their subdivision. We do not live in Hendersonville or Flat Rock but are county residents, said Rosalind Ryan, one of the residents. In May of 2018 the nine of us spent 17,600 to have our private road repaved. The city and a developer who plans to buy the Halfway Tree Mobile Home Park on Rutledge Drive met the homeowners face to face last week after the city scheduled a meeting to explain what was happening and reassure them that their neighborhood would not be permanently scarred by the project. The neighbors concerns arise from the effort by A. M. Partners LLC, of Spartanburg, South Carolina, to fix longstanding septic tank problems at Halfway Tree before closing on its purchase of the 113 unit park bordering the village of Flat Rock. The current owner, Upchurch Marinas Inc. , of South Florida, in November settled an ongoing enforcement action by state water regulators, agreeing to pay a reduced fine of 35,000 and apply for city sewer hookup for the 18 acre park by April 1. All but one family among the homeowners in Hood Heights was represented last week as City Manager John Connet, city utilities engineers and the developer, Tim Manson, explained the sewer line easement and construction process. Surface water pollution from the failing septic tanks was never resolved after numerous attempted enforcement events, Connet said. The need to provide sewer is critical because of the septic issues in the mobile home park. Knowing residents were fearful about what was happening, Connet attempted to assure them that the developer would not leave their roads, yards and driveways torn up. You put your own money in the paving, he said. We re very mindful of that. The ownership of the road that makes up the spine of Hood Heights has caused the confusion that the city and developer are trying to sort out. I was under the impression that the road was a public right of way and once we got into it further we realized it was not, Tim Thomason, the developer s engineer, told the homeowners. Attorneys for the city and the developer researched land records for the area back to 1924 and could not ascertain the exact legal ownership of the road. Some homeowners say they ve always thought they owned the road to the centerline but land records don t confirm that. The only legally sound way to run the sewer line, attorneys for the city and developer advised, is to condemn the property and create a recorded easement. This legal situation is definitely a curveball, Manson said. Legally we re really in a no man s land and as a private entity I can t take the risk and run a sewer line down the road and have someone make a claim to ownership. This is a very complex, very expensive project. It s above and beyond what we originally thought. Manson and City Engineer Brent Detwiler sought to assure the homeowners that the contractor will cover sewer pipe trenches, resew grass, replant bushes and repave the road once the project is done. We ll limit the amount of disturbance on Hood Heights so folks can get around, so we don t have hundreds of feet of trench open at once, Detwiler said. We ve actually done projects like this in the past and these are provisions we require. If a landscape buffer is removed, it will be put back driveways, everything will be as good or better than prior to construction. The developer hopes to have a permit for the sewer line by March and start construction by April. This was the best, most equitable, least disturbing way to be able to provide gravity sewer service to the mobile home park, Thomason said. This was the least disruptive option to be able to get to a gravity flow scenario. But the gravity flow option is not without challenges. A hump in the topography means that the high spot will require the contractor to dig a trench as deep as 22 feet. That concerned Terry Gibbs, a Hood Heights homeowner who is also a grading contractor. I know how much excavation you have to do to dig a hole that deep, he said. Like those in Halfway Tree, Hood Heights homeowners are in unincorporated Henderson County and on septic tanks. Manson said the contractor will install lines from the sewer main for laterals the service lines that lead from a home to a sewer pipe so homeowners can connect to city sewer. I m not totally against what you re doing, Gibbs said. He told Manson he could sweeten it up for these people by paying to run the sewer line all the way to homes. We re doing you a favor. You could do us a favor. The final details for providing of the laterals have not been worked out, Manson responded. There would have to be some kind of stub up for you guys to access. The main will be sized to everybody along the line. Some of you may not want sewer but we will leave the sewer accessible at the property line. Not everyone was happy with that. You are causing a huge disruption in our neighborhood and there s not too much we can do about it, Ryan said. I am adding a lot of value to your property by bringing sewer to your property line, Manson responded. Covering the cost of the laterals all the way to homes Gibbs estimated that running the 4 inch connection would cost around 2,500 is not possible, Manson said. The way I am today I could not commit to doing that financially, he said. When someone asked about annexation, Connet ruled that out. You will not be annexed by the city of Hendersonville, he said. Manson s company has developed manufactured home neighborhoods in the South Carolina Upstate and run sewer lines before, he said, although the legal no man s land in Hood Heights makes this line more complicated than usual. There is still a lot to do, he said. This meeting is a step in the right direction and will enable us to move ahead full steam ahead. "
Beverlywood,"Paul Koretz to Run for City Controller Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Koretz has announced plans to run for city controller in March 2022. He officially declared his candidacy on Jan. 2. Having been an elected official since 1988, both at the state level and as a local city councilman in two cities for over 25 years, people will understand with that background why I would be looking at this, the 64 year old told the Journal. If elected, Koretz, who currently sits on the city council s budget and finance committee, would be the city s 20th controller. The current controller, Ron Galperin, who also is Jewish, will be termed out in 2022. Koretz praised Galperin s work, saying, I think he has done a lot to find efficiencies and make the office more transparent. I think he has been an excellent city controller. If he were not termed out, I wouldn t run against him in a million years. To date, Koretz has received endorsements from more than 90 current and former elected officials, including Mayor Eric Garcetti, City Council President Herb Wesson and City Council President elect Nury Martinez. Explaining why he announced his candidacy more than two years before the election, Koretz said, I have all this support and I might as well let people know early. Koretz has served on the city council since 2009, representing an area that extends from Beverlywood, Pico Robertson and Fairfax into Century City and Westwood, and up into the hillsides of the West San Fernando Valley. My support of the Jewish community and support for Israel will not change in this position. I will continue to be out front and lead in every way I can think of. Paul Koretz As a former council member for the city of West Hollywood, Koretz led an effort to incorporate West Hollywood as its own city. On the L. A. city council, he helped the city navigate the recession in 2009 when local officials, including former L. A. Mayor Richard Riordan, were calling on the city to declare bankruptcy. I helped us to get through that by looking for efficiencies, Koretz said. It was as simple as paying bills on time. Koretz also has fought against mansionization in his district, championed environmental protections and supported the construction of affordable housing for the city s homeless. Born in the San Fernando Valley, Koretz is a longtime leader in the organized Jewish community. His father, who escaped Nazi Germany, introduced Koretz to Democratic politics when Koretz was a young boy. His mother s family fled the pogroms of Russia before emigrating to the United States. Koretz, who lives his wife, Gail, and their daughter, Rachel, in the Beverly Grove neighborhood, also was among those who denounced Airbnb when the hospitality company said it would delist properties located in the West Bank. If elected city controller, Koretz said he would continue to be a vocal advocate for Israel. My support of the Jewish community and support for Israel will not change in this position, he said. I will continue to be out front and lead in every way I can think of. "

Sidehill,"With Hawley broadband setup nearing completion, officials focus on connecting residents Related stories HAWLEY The Florida, Hawley, Monroe and Savoy (FHMS) broadband buildout moved into the fourth phase of a five phase plan in December, and officials are focusing on connecting residents as quickly as possible. According to FHMS Broadband Network Committee Chair Kirby Lark Thwing, Phase 3 was completed on Dec. 18, building the necessary infrastructure in Hawley on Forget Road near Sidehill Farm, Stetson Road, West Hawley Road near Savoy Road, Forge Hollow Road and near 129 East Hawley Road. Other sites within Hawley have been operational for a few months now. We re signing people on and connecting them as fast as we can, Thwing said. Phase 4 infrastructure was expected to be completed by the end of 2020. Thwing said previously that the total cost for the four town broadband network, which uses Massachusetts Broadband Institute (MBI) funding, is estimated to be roughly 2.4 million. So far, the network has connected 172 homes. Once Phase 4 infrastructure is up, the project will focus on the Borden Mountain site, which Thwing noted has seen a more complicated permitting process. We are also seeking permission from Heath to install a pole there to provide service to the northeastern corner of Dodge Corner (Road), Thwing wrote in a notice to Hawley residents in December. Once all planned infrastructure is up, we will focus on installations and system tweaking to maximize our service capability and reliability.

Chestnuthill,"Monroe DA: Constable, candidate lied about residency – Times News Online A constable and a candidate in Monroe County have been charged with lying about their residences in order to be eligible for election. The Monroe County District Attorney s office said Vincent James Cefarello, 64, of Chestnuthill Township, has been charged in connection with a scheme to fraudulently obtain appointment to the office of Pennsylvania state constable in Polk Township. Cefarello formerly served as the Pennsylvania state constable for Ross Township. In January 2019, Cefarello moved into Chestnuthill Township and resigned his position as constable for Polk Township. Pennsylvania law requires that constables and deputy constables reside within the municipality where they are elected or appointed. Now living in Chestnuthill Township, Cefarello sought election as the Pennsylvania state constable for Chestnuthill Township, appearing on the ballot in the May primary election. Cefarello was defeated in the primary and ran a write in campaign for election as a constable in the November general election. He failed to obtain enough votes to win election to the office. Cefarello, believing that the position of Pennsylvania State Constable in Polk Township remained vacant, subsequently changed his driver s license address to the address of a friend who lives in Polk Township and then filed a petition with the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas seeking appointment to that position. In that petition, Cefarello falsely claimed that he was a resident of, and registered to vote in, Polk Township, as would be required to hold the office he sought. Cefarello has been charged by detectives from the Monroe County District Attorney s Criminal Investigation Division with unsworn falsification to authorities, tampering with public records or information, and obstructing administration of law or other governmental function. A preliminary hearing before Magisterial District Judge Kristina Anzini of Stroudsburg is pending. The district attorney s office also said that Manuel Rodriguez, 64, of Bronx, New York, faces charges of making knowingly false statements about his residence in order to seek reelection as a Constable in Delaware Water Gap. Rodriguez, who has served as the Pennsylvania State Constable in Delaware Water Gap since 2014, sought reelection during the 2019 election cycle. Rodriguez, who actually lives in Bronx, New York, made several false statements about his residence, claiming to live in Delaware Water Gap. In May, before the primary election, Rodriguez filed a petition with the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas seeking to appoint Joseph Maher as a deputy constable and listed Maher s address as the same address as Rodriguez s apartment in Watergap Village. This petition came to the attention of detectives from the Criminal Investigation Division of the Monroe County Office of the District Attorney who were familiar with both Rodriguez and Maher, an attorney, from a pending criminal case against Rodriguez. At the time, Maher was believed to live in Emmaus, Lehigh County, making him ineligible to serve as deputy constable for Rodriguez. Detectives learned that Rodriguez was, in fact, no longer living in Delaware Water Gap and was living in New York City. The detectives confirmed that Rodriguez was physically living in Bronx, NY, while maintaining an apartment in Delaware Water Gap. An apartment he rarely visited but instead is occupied by his friend, Joseph Maher. Despite not living in Delaware Water Gap, Rodriguez made several statements on official election paperwork claiming to live in Delaware Water Gap to secure his position on the ballot during the May primary and the November general election. Rodriguez, the only candidate on the ballot for the office of Constable in Delaware Water Gap, subsequently won reelection. Rodriguez faces charges of false swearing, unsworn falsification to authorities, and obstructing administration of law or other governmental operation. Additionally, the Office of the District Attorney is pursuing Rodriguez s removal from office, as he s ineligible to hold the office due to not living in Delaware Water Gap. p Vincent James Cefarello /p "

Friday members of the task force checked a home in the 700 block of South Eighth Street, Allentown and arrested Burkett without incident. He was turned over to the Pennsylvania State Police and was arraigned Friday afternoon. The shooting happened at a home on Silver Maple Road in the Sun Valley section of Chestnuthill Township just after 10:30 p. m. Dec. 4. When police arrived, they found Dylan Beinert, 22, dead, and Khalil Durante, 23, and his father, Walter Howard Durante, had been critically injured. According to police, Beinert met Powell on Tinder and Snapchat and set up a drug deal before the shooting. When Beinert showed Powell the drugs in his bedroom, a witness said Powell left to get her wallet out of her vehicle, but instead sent in Burke and Burkett with guns to rob him, but a struggle between the men ensued with Beinert eventually getting shot. The gunmen then told the two Durantes, as well as three other people who were at the residence, to lie face down on the kitchen floor while they removed items from the home. After getting everyone outside the house, police said, one of the gunmen told Khalil Durante to say your prayers, and then shot him while he was praying. Walter Durante screamed, according to the witness, and was also shot by the gunman. The gunmen then fled in two vehicles that were waiting along Silver Maple Road. Eric Gulley, 41, of Allentown, also faces charges of illegal possession of a firearm and evidence tampering in the incident. United States Marshal Pane stated, It s the Marshals Services duty to ensure that those charged with violent crimes have their day in court. It is my sincere hope that the victim s family will find some measure of comfort knowing the suspect will face justice. The USMS Fugitive Task Force in the Middle District of Pennsylvania is comprised of 20 state, county and local police agencies, including: the Pennsylvania State Police the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and the Scranton Police Department all of whom participated in this investigation.

Chestnuthill,"Suspect in weed deal turned double homicide arrested in the Lehigh Valley A third suspect facing homicide charges in a double killing last month in Monroe County is in custody, authorities said. The U. S. Marshals Service announced the arrest Wednesday of Zaire Unique Burkett, 20, of Whitehall Township. He is in custody, charged with two counts of homicide and related charges, along with Deani A. Powell, 20, of Easton and Matthew J. Burke, 21, of East Stroudsburg.

He is identified in court records as Harrith Saleem Brown, 23, of Fredericksburg, Virginia. Eric D. Gulley, 41, of Allentown, is charged in the investigation with a weapons offense and hindering apprehension and has been released on 50,000 unsecured bail pending a preliminary hearing set for Feb. 14, court records show. He allegedly helped hide a revolver used by Burke in the incident. Burkett, Powell and Burke are all being held in prison without the possibility of bail. Fatally shot during the robbery Dec. 4 at a home in the 1700 block of Silver Maple Road in Chestnuthill Township were 22 year old Dylan Beinert and 23 year old Khalil Durante.

Burke then shot Khalil Durante in the head and shot Walter Durante, who had screamed and reached for a gun, investigators said.

A district judge sent all charges against them to Monroe County Court, following their preliminary hearings held to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations. The next step for them is formal arraignment. Burkett s preliminary hearing is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 7 before District Judge Brian Germano. He was arrested about 6 a. m. Wednesday after members of the U. S.

Callowhill,"PhilaMOCA set to reopen in its home, owned by celeb DJ Diplo and now legit The Philadelphia Mausoleum of Contemporary Art will celebrate its 10th anniversary by reopening its doors to the public after a long city imposed hiatus. The beloved arts venue known as PhilaMOCA won a special exception from the city s Zoning Board of Adjustment on Wednesday morning, and the indie institution s manager expects to be fully operational again by April. PhilaMOCA s troubles began in September when representatives from the city s Department of Licenses and Inspections showed up in the middle of a concert. They said, you are zoned as an art gallery but this is a nightclub setting, said Eric Bresler, PhilaMOCA s manager. I didn t argue. Art has a broad definition and we ve certainly exploited that over the years. We outgrew our art gallery zoning. The city inspectors were not wrong about the nightclub element. Celebrity DJ and music producer Diplo has owned the former tombstone and mausoleum showroom since 2007, when his Mad Decent record label bought the North 12th Street building for 300,000, according to city records. The iconic Callowhill building used to serve as Mad Decent s headquarters and host the Mad Decent Block Party, a dance festival that Diplo, who attended Temple, has since taken to other cities. But with the no longer local DJ busy touring internationally and posing for GQ spreads, it wasn t only the building s zoning that needed updating. PhilaMOCA also needed to fulfill a few small fire code obligations like getting extinguishers inspected and changing the swing of a door so it opens outward. Now all of that is done, and once they secure a special assembly permit, PhilaMOCA will be back in business, Bresler said. In the process of going legit, PhilaMOCA also got entangled in the vagaries of the city s Registered Community Group system. For years, the art venue on North 12th Street dealt amicably with the Callowhill Neighborhood Association, a deep rooted group whose jurisdiction technically ends a few dozen feet from the venue s doors. When Bresler and his team applied for the special exception, however, they became involved in negotiations with the Democratic 14th Ward RCO which is the designated neighborhood group for the area. (The city s law allows political organizations to also become the civic groups that developers and business owners have to interface with for zoning cases, although critics say that ward organizations don t fulfill the transparency and accountability measures the law requires. ) Bresler said that he d never heard of the 14th Ward RCO prior to the fall. The hyperlocal political group didn t know about PhilaMOCA s existence either. The groups are friendly now, but Bresler said he found the negotiations bewildering. We live in a rapidly developing neighborhood so I think the group is at a point where they can leverage their power in ways that will improve the neighborhood, Bresler said. Whether the leveraging they do is moral or legal I can t comment on. But I was certainly uncomfortable with some of the things they were demanding. Bresler wouldn t say what those sticking points were, but in the end, the community benefits agreement signed by two sides simply establishes operating hours and a few other ground rules. Many of the stipulations were things that the venue was doing anyway, like ensuring that underage people aren t consuming alcohol on the premises. Another issue was about using the bathroom on the outside, and there are going to be some crowds and we want to ensure the line will not go in front of neighbors houses, Diane Monroe of the 14th Ward told the zoning board at the Wednesday hearing. Calls to 14th ward leaders were not returned by late Wednesday afternoon. The operating hours for concerts will be between 10 a. m. and 10:30 p. m. on weeknights, with an hour later extension on weekends. Movie screenings can last until 1:00 a. m. , to ensure that there can be two screenings in a night. I will miss living in the wild west that we ve operated in for the last 10 years, said Bresler, who has managed the venue since 2012. That really added to the ambiance and the mystique of PhilaMOCA. I just hope none of that is lost now that we are a legitimate and recognized and watched building. PhilaMOCA is raising money on GoFundMe to help pay for the expenses incurred since September. They ve raised over 32,000 by Wednesday, which has been used to cover rent, utilities, and fire code upgrades since September. They hope to raise at least another 10,000 to 20,000 to continue covering rent, utilities and remaining repairs until April. "
Callowhill,"Why some Chinatown residents oppose a new Franklin Square station Wei Chen, a Chinatown youth organizer, often takes high school students to Franklin Square for team building exercises. The 28 year old says the spot near the corner of 7th and Race, which seems to invite congregation with tables and benches, is where students engage in activities like trust falls and storytelling. It s something that connects them to each other, Chen said. Helping them to identify with each other. But Chen may have to find another spot to teach communication and collaboration lessons. The site is home to PATCO s Franklin Square Station, which has been dormant for more than 40 years and is now scheduled to reopen in the summer of 2023 with a new headhouse measuring roughly 3,000 square feet. Delaware River Port Authority, which oversees PATCO, plans to begin construction in Spring 2021. Chinatown residents that use the park say they were not informed by DRPA of the coming change. Many in the area, which is just a few blocks west of Franklin Square, were immediately concerned. An online petition soon followed. At a public meeting Monday about the project, hosted by DRPA, Chen said authority officials could use some lessons in communication themselves. I think this is very, very disrespect ful , he said. Before you make a decision, you ignore community members voice in this event. You ignore the user of this green space. And you make decisions, and you re going to go ahead. PATCO says the project will take up only 1% of the block sized park, but Chinatown community members claim the southwest area is heavily used. The authority s 1% calculation is a gross underestimation in their view. When we re losing one of our most well used green spaces at Franklin Square, I think residents rightfully ask what are we gaining from this, said Anna Perng, a Chinatown resident and community organizer. During the meeting, one person in attendance floated the idea of DRPA donating land they own nearby to the city as compensation for the loss in the park. In response, one DRPA official said no one present could make that commitment, but they d accept it as part of the recommendations that we ll take up from the community. In recent years, community groups have tried to address Chinatown s dearth of green space through efforts like pop ups and a new community center developed as part of a new residential tower called The Crane. Some of the efforts have won support from the city and other public agencies. But there are no plans currently to replace the lost green space at Franklin Square, according to Kathryn Ott Lovell, commissioner of Philadelphia Parks and Recreation. Parks and Recreation will continue working alongside DRPA and the community to ensure the project has minimal impact on residents ability to enjoy the park, Maita Soukup, a spokesperson for the city s Parks and Rec Department added in an email. Ott Lovell said the station reopening could help bring more activity to the park, a net positive in her mind. We re very excited about the opportunity for new visitors and tourists to come and visit the park, said Ott Lovell. And we re excited about the economic development opportunities that this could mean in terms of bringing more business and individuals to that section of the city. If everything goes as planned for PATCO, this will be one of several reopenings since the station was built in 1936. It was part of the Bridge Line operation between 8th and Market and Broadway in Camden. It closed after World War II. Despite reopening a few times, low ridership made it hard to keep open in decades that followed. It shuttered one last time in 1979. A lot has changed in Philadelphia since then, however. The city s population increased, and development is booming in many parts of the city, including the neighborhoods surrounding Franklin Square. Callowhill is rapidly transforming into a village of luxury condos, with hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate investment at work on blocks once dominated by industry. Piedrock Capital Partners opened a massive housing development at 4th and Race in Old City, and other developments are changing the fabric of the once quiet area. The Equal Justice Center at 8th and Race streets is slated to open in 2022, and the Philadelphia Police headquarters at the Roundhouse is expected to go up for sale soon. Plus, the city is in the design phase of reconfiguring Race Street between 5th and 8th streets to increase safety. The plan includes narrowing the roadway, flexible delineator posts at some intersections, and parking protected bike lanes. The authority says they re banking on new development in the area to be a boon for station patronage, while the station itself boosts further growth. There is a lot of development already going on right there, right now, said John Hanson, CEO of DRPA and the president of PATCO. And the opening of this station will be a catalyst to development in that area. While the success of the completed project remains in question, the construction is almost certain to cause disruption to the area. In addition to a new headhouse, the authority plans to replace and relocate an old water main that runs north south underneath the site to underneath 7th street. John Chin, executive director of Philadelphia Chinatown Community Development Corporation, says this leg of construction will impede traffic and cause congestion. He worries more drivers will detour through Chinatown, an area already heavily impacted by vehicle pollutants from the Vine Expressway, researchers say. At the end of the day, this opening of PATCO is going to have negative health benefits to people that live in Chinatown, said Chin. I m sure PATCO doesn t want that. They need to figure out what they re going to do to mitigate that. PATCO general manager John Rink said he and his team will take the community s concerns back to the drawing board. He added that comments about the community s use of the park left an impression on him. We really did get a lot of valuable input and discussion from those who use the park and can be impacted by us building the station, he said. We ll take everyone s comment and question the same. "
Callowhill,"Philly saw $1.35B in business deals in 2019, with life sciences leading Last fall, Philadelphia was on track to have its best ever year in terms of business deals since the year 2000. Now that Q4 has officially come to an end and we ve entered a new decade, that statement has rung true. In 2019, Philadelphia saw 1.351 billion in deals accounting for most of the entire state s 1.57 billion, according to a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)/CB Insights MoneyTree report. Philadelphia continued to rise in dollars spent, crossing 1 billion in deals for the first time since the new millennium. The region saw 89 deals this past year compared to 2018 s 108, the report said. But a trend in deals for the region mirrors the national numbers there are fewer deals made in 2019 than in previous years, but the amount spent has been higher. Investors put nearly half a billion dollars more into deals in 2019 than in 2018. The Philadelphia region had a dream year, any way you look at it dollars, deal size, any of those point to an outstanding year for the region, Brad Phillips, an advisor to emerging technology and life science companies at PwC, told Technical. ly. Philips also said that the leading industry in terms of deals by far was healthcare, which accounted for 1.045 billion of all the money spent in the region last year. A distant second was internet, and third was mobile and telecom, he said. One of the region s biggest successes, and one of the year s three mega deals (deals over 100 million) was a deal by Century Therapeutics, which raised 250 million to use adult stem cells to develop curative allogeneic cell therapies for cancer. Others include genetic medicines company Passage Bio s also massive 115 million Series A in Q1 and 110 Series B in Q3. Other significant deals include Plymouth Meeting based biopharmaceutical company Harmony Biosciences 50 million, HealthVerity s Series C that raised 25 million, data analytics startup Crossbeam s 12.5 million, Nerd Street Gamers 12 million series A, ecommerce company Sidecar s 7.5 million and cell therapy startup Carisma Therapeutics 6 million. Advertisement These numbers should be great news to companies looking for investors in 2020 and beyond, Phillips said. When funding increases in an area, it shows other investors that it s a worthwhile place to spend money, he said. P. S. Notably missing from this list and figures: goPuff. The Callowhill based on demand delivery service company got a secret 750 million investment from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank last August. (It would be the region s first tech unicorn with a household name. ) But of course, because it was kept quiet until the news broke late last week, it s not showing up in any roundups yet. 30 "
