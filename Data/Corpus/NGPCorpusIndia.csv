Thiruvengada Nagar,"Spurned, engg student stabs classmate  CHENNAI: An engineering student on Thursday stabbed his classmate on their college campus in Surapet near Puzhal because she had broken off their relationship.  While Kavya, a 22-year-old final year ECE student of Vellammal Engineering College, is recovering in hospital, her assailant, Sakthivel, is now lodged in prison. 
Around 10.30am, Ambattur police inspector P Stephen said, Sakthivel stabbed Kavya at least six times while she was standing outside their class.  He had brought the knife covered in a sheet of paper and tucked in his belt, police said after talking to some students who had witnessed the attack.  He was soon overpowered by security guards and handed over to police. 
College authorities rushed Kavya, who sustained injuries on her chest, hands and in the stomach, to a private hospital in Ambattur.  She was later shifted to the hospital owned by the group which runs the college. 
Soon after the attack, when reporters wanted to get the version of the college authorities, they were shooed away by security personnel who said media would not be allowed on the campus.  Later, TOI visited the Ambattur police station where Sakthivel was detained.  He appeared to show no remorse for his action.  He was later remanded in judicial custody. 
Police said Sakthivel of Nagapattinam and Kavya of Ranipet in Vellore had known each other for more than three years and that Kavya had severed ties with him a few days ago. 
A classmate of Kavya, who did not wish to be named, said that he kept calling her over phone which she ignored.  “She said she had been let down and did not want to continue their relationship anymore.  However, Sakthivel did not want to let go of her,’’ the classmate said. 
Some of his friends with whom Sakthivel shared a room in Thiruvengada Nagar near Surapet said he had even tried to visit her at the hostel where she stayed but failed.  “He became desperate and said he would go after her and that if he couldn’t get her none should,” said a friend.

Dream Houses Galore Driven by the demand from buyers, property developers have begun to shift from the beaten path on these two stretches that run parallel to each other and past some of the city’s prime property.  The OMR is already well-known for its high-rises and realtors are now looking at creating villas.  Meanwhile, the landscape off the ECR, with all its beachside bungalows, is now dotted with multi-storey buildings. 
Rajiv Gandhi Salai (popularly known as OMR) now has at least 15 villa projects coming up and ECR, known for its sprawling bungalows with high security, is witnessing the construction of many multi-storey buildings as well. 
C.  A.  Benoy, an OMR resident, who has booked a villa in Karapakkam as an investment, says the value of this property is appreciating well.  “The villa I have chosen is priced very reasonably and I am also getting half a ground of land.  I chose OMR because it is a very different kind of road.  Along with IT and ITES, other industries too are coming up too,” he says. 
R.  Kumar, managing director, Navin Housing and Properties Pvt.  Ltd. , explains that the narrow roads off OMR are seeing a boom in construction of villas.  “People are also looking for facilities including club houses, swimming pools and lawn spaces.  Villas are like developed colonies with a lot of open spaces, which is their USP.  By paying just a little more, the buyer gets these advantages,” he says. 
While OMR’s development is typically necessity-driven, ECR has always been the choice of those who look for great lifestyles and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. 
Gaurav Sanghvi, director, Olympia Merlin, says that a lot of buyers are from the IT and ITES industry.  They want to work on OMR and live on the ECR with its great ocean view and greenery.  There is very less pollution here and the road is also being widened, so you can travel faster,” he says.  Around 20 per cent of buyers are local investors and another 20 per cent are NRIs, who are used to a lifestyle with amenities and a view of the ocean, he adds. 
However, the high-rise run on ECR may not last long as the Directorate of Town and Country Planning recently modified norms for multi-storey buildings and restricted building height on that stretch, explains N.  Nandakumar, CREDAI President (Tamil Nadu).  Now it has been limited to stilt + 4 floors. 
The development on ECR has been possible with multiple land owners coming together along with builders to develop vast tracts of land, he says adding that between apartments and villas, the choice is for the latter.

Patrakarpuram,"Control room to manage 115 city crossings  LUCKNOW: New parking spots, stricter and more traffic police personnel and a modern control room is what it will take to cure the city’s traffic menace.  Preventing protesters from gathering at Vidhan Sabha and clearing encroachments on roads are also major challenges. 
The CM's directives to improve the city’s traffic situation are forcing agencies concerned to work overtime.  The police’s traffic cell has made a list of five key points under its purview for better management. 
The most ambitious step is to synchronise vehicular movement across the 115 crossings in the city with an advanced control room.  On December 10, the chief minister had directed the divisional commissioner to chart out a comprehensive traffic plan. 
There are traffic signals at 40 crossings but half of these do not work.  The remaining are maintained by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation and are rarely put to use to regulate motorists. 
Additional superintendent of traffic cell GP Chaturvedi said the 75 crossings without a signal include Polytechnic, Patrakarpuram, Ravindralaya, Paper Mill Colony, Natha Tiraha, Chirraiya Jheel, Lohia Hospital, Ismailganj, Chowk, and Butler Palace, among others. 
“We will take control of the existing 40 crossings and increase the network of signals across the 75 additional crossings.  The traffic flow at main crossings will be monitored by the control room through cameras.  The time to go green will be adjusted, just the way it is done in metro cities,” elaborated Chaturvedi on the ambitious plan. 
Errant motorists and parking offenders will be taken to task as registration plates will be covered under the e-surveillance scheme.  “Challans will be sent to vehicle owners via post,” added Chaturvedi.  Multi-pronged approach Besides managing crossings, the cell’s remaining key points include:
1) 13 parking spots: Near Lal Bahadur Shastri Bhawan, Patrakarpuram, Faizabad Road in Indiranagar, Qaiserbagh, Aishbagh, Medical College, Hewett Road, Naka, Kapoorthala, Nakkhas, Chowk market, Rakabganj, Vivek Khand
2) More traffic personnel: There is a need to induct an additional 200 trained cops to manage traffic.  The department faces a shortage of about 25% against its sanctioned strength
3) Improve road engineering at 34 places: In the survey, 34 crossings and intersections in various parts of the city have been identified for immediate overhaul.  Road engineering and road safety measures across these crossings need to be augmented.  Nahariya and Tedhipulia crossings are two major challenges
4) Shifting dharna sthal: The Charbagh-Nishatganj route gets choked due to protests opposite Vidhan Sabha.  After the chief minister’s rap, city police have cornered protesters to other locations such as Laxman Mela ground.  A vacant plot in Bangla Bazar has been identified as a permanent solution
Official’s view: DM Raj Shekhar said a traffic improvement committee at the district level had been constituted to ensure that immediate goals are achieved.  Lack of coordination between agencies has resulted in faulty planning and poor road design.  Shekhar said, “Meetings will be held regularly.  Its members are the DM, SSP, secretary of the government department, municipal commissioner and PWD executive engineer.  The SP traffic will be the member secretary.  Inputs of all agencies concerned will be considered while executing infrastructure projects.  needed”.  Other goals: a) Clearing encroachment and roadside parking: Police and administrative officials will jointly clear encroachments.  Owing to work on Lucknow Metro, Kanpur Road and Krishnanagar will be targeted in the first phase.  After that, the around Charbagh station, Naka and Bansmandi will be cleared of encroachment and roadside parking of private or public vehicles. 
b) Timing of schools: Schools within an area will get over at intervals of 10-15 minutes from one another.  This will ease sudden pressure of school vehicles on roads.  School management will assist in traffic management of 50-100 sq m of area around school at the time of start and end of school. 
c) Increasing length of dividers: Road dividers at Burlington crossing and near IT crossing will be elongated further as traffic here is unregulated.  About 15 unauthorised cuts in the road median between Alambagh and Hazratganj will be plugged. 
*) Enforcing one ways: People head towards Bara Birwa, Nahariya in wrong direction from road opposite Vijay Gas Service and Badnaam Laddu in Alambagh.  From Capitol crossing, people head towards Bapu Bhawan in opposite direction.  Further ahead, from Shakti Bhawan people reach Nawal Kishore road in wrong direction. 
*) Shifting road medians: The road medians at some places will be shifted.  Median between Burlington and Rana Pratap crossings and that towards Narhi just ahead of Hazratganj crossing has been earmarked for attention.  Charbagh-Nishatganj carriageway will turn wider if that happens.  Long-term solutions There is a plan to acquire space near IT crossing to increase carriageway width and build a flyover and elevated corridor.  Ring Road at Tedhipulia has been cited among the most chronic points when it comes to traffic chaos.  Dewa Road trisection is another point where traffic jams and accidents have been on the rise.  Flyover/underpass across Nahariya crossing near Alambagh are also termed important. 
On the lines of metro cities, card-based penalties will be issued to traffic violators with help of an advanced traffic control room.  Driving licences will be punched and repeat offenders will be issued stricter penalties.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Broke traffic rule? e-challan is on its way  LUCKNOW: On the lines of metrocities, Lucknow can now boast of an e-challan system too.  Having rolled out the pilot run in the past fortnight successfully, traffic wing of city police has already sent notices to 32 motor vehicle owners caught flouting rules on camera. 
With this development, Lucknowites may look forward to reduced chaos on streets and improved traffic discipline.  Additional superintendent of traffic police Brajesh Kumar Mishra said his team was trying to follow the Bengaluru traffic management model.  The IT city has the best enforcement statistics related to traffic offences in the country and technology is the key. 
Closer home, the traffic cell is issuing tickets under many sections of Motor Vehicle Act which was so far rarely put to use.  For instance on Monday a car owner from Ruchi Khand in Aashiana was identified as an offender with help of cameras installed near Patrakarpuram crossing in Gomtinagar. 
The fine would be issued under sections 122 and 126 which amount to causing inconvenience to other road users by parking vehicle dangerously and leaving the vehicle stationary on road for hours.  “No tickets have been issued for such offences in the past,” added a traffic cop. 
With the help of cameras installed around prominent crossings in the city, modern control staff goes through live feeds at Gomtinagar located police command centre.  Through registration number, address of vehicle owner is traced and notice served. 
“The notice also carries printscreen (snapshot) of the vehicle flouting rule.  After that, 15 days time is given to deposit the fine amount at traffic police office located in Sadar.  The owner has to bring original documents and driving licence to the office.  In case the needful is not done, 15 days later we will lodge a criminal case and confiscate the vehicle with court’s permission,” said senior superintendent of police Yashasvi Yadav.

The company is also aiming to revamp most of its old stores on global design pattern.  Thapliyal said that the company would expand its footprint in the state from present 18 stores to about 29 this year as UP is an important market for them.  “Most of the new stores would be opened on global design patterns so that customers are able to experience same services across globe.  Even few of the older ones would also be revamped based on international designs”, he added.  Such global format stores are already operational in Aliganj, Patrakarpuram and Chowk areas of Lucknow.

Quake tremors and Bada Mangal bhandara add to commotion on streets  LUCKNOW: Ranjan Kumar was heading to his shop on his bike around 12.40pm on Tuesday after having lunch.  He saw a large number of people standing on the road near Gomtinagar railway station. 
âI could not understand what had happened.  It felt very unusual,â said Ranjan, who runs a stationery shop near the railway station. 
A short distance away was a Bada Mangal bhandara under a tent but nobody from the crowd moved towards it.  Meanwhile, cars were piling on the stretch as the carriageway got blocked due to the huge crowd.  Drivers had no option but to honk continuously to turn towards Patrakarpuram. 
It was a struggle for Ranjan and many others negotiating the roads.  Apart from the devotees who throng Bada Mangal stalls, vehicular movement across the city took a hit on Tuesday noon for at least 30 minutes. 
Many families were out on the streets fearing more tremors.  Jaywalking and criss-crossing kept commuters on toes.  Bottlenecks were reported across the inner roads of Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Vikasnagar, Aliganj, Chowk, Qaiserbagh and Aminabad, among others. 
Hazratganj was worst hit.  The tremors shook the city around the time many people head out of office to have lunch.  School hours also end around the same time.  Coupled with Bada Mangal festivities, jams were witnessed across Rana Pratap Marg, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Sapru Marg, Shahnajaf Road, Meerabai Marg and Ashok Marg. 
âTraffic was moving at a snailâs pace on Meerabai Marg.  I kept honking but nobody paid heed.  People kept chatting with each other and I got late for a meeting,â said Jiyamau resident Gaurishankar Mishra.  Traffic superintendent Brajesh Mishra said congestion lasted for a brief duration in places where a large number commercial buildings exist.  âBut vehicular movement was normal once people were indoors,â he added.

Unannounced diversions turn Gomtinagar streets chaotic  LUCKNOW Unannounced traffic diversions are leading to chaos on roads leading to Gomtinagar for the past three days.  Due to construction work, barricades have been put up at the Gomtinagar end of the railway overbridge and around Patrakarpuram crossing. 
As a result, thousands of commuters were caught unawares have to make sudden U-turns or ply in the wrong direction.  While work on the PICUP building-RML hospital flyover has stalled traffic movement on the road from Gomtinagar to Polytechnic, repair work on the road leading to Husadia from Patrakarpuram is compelling motorists to ply in the wrong direction. 
Lack of coordination between the traffic cell of Lucknow police, civic bodies and agencies executing the construction work has come to the fore yet again.  There are no signboards or warning boards at either site to guide first time visitors on alternative routes. 
“While Gomtinagar residents are aware of the routes in other localities, people coming from other parts of the city are badly hit.  Relatives coming to meet us for Eid decided to head back to Saadatganj instead of visiting us,” said Faraz Ali, a resident of Vijay Khand I. 
Ali’s relatives were among hundreds of commuters who plied all the way to Polytechnic and made a U-turn to reach Gomtinagar only to realize they had reached the same spot.  At Patrakarpuram, instead of taking internal routes, commuters had to ply in the wrong direction.  A big trench had been dug up at CMS Gomtinagar crossing just few days ago and had caused a lot of inconvenience to people.  However, the families staying around the crossing used their clout and the trench was levelled on Monday. 
SP traffic said the situation would improve from Friday. 
“We would ask executing agencies to deploy a person or use signage to guide first-time road users here,” he added.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  The burning issue is we are not fire-ready  LUCKNOW: Monday night’s fire in basement shops of Janpath Market once again highlights the unpreparedness of city markets to deal with such incidents
Aminabad
The busiest and most crowded market of the city is not prepared to handle any fire emergency.  In Mohan Market, only a few shops are equipped with fire extinguishers.  However, most do not have any ventilation or emergency exit.  Vice president of Mohan Market Anurag Grover said, “None of the shops here have fire safety equipment, as it is costly to maintain them.  We had requested for fire tenders at Jhandewala Park but they were stationed for a week.  All that while, street vendors obstructed them. ” The power department has initiated work of underground wiring to avoid instances of short circuit.  Wires dangle at several places. 
Kapoorthala
More than 5,000 people visit the Pragati Market in posh Kapoorthala everyday.  The commercial hub has over 250 shops but there is not a single fire extinguisher or fire bucket in the market.  There is no emergency exit or fire escape and windows are obstructed by advertisement hoardings.  Shop owner Mohan Merani said, “The last time a fire broke out, we had to drag a fire hose from the adjacent Sahara building. ” Vikram Chaurasiya, a committee member, said, “Within five months, we will place fire extinguishers. ”
Sri Ram Tower
A reality check at Sri Ram Tower, a hub of electronic gadgets, reveals that the wiring in the building is exposed and maintenance is dismal.  With an average footfall of 3,000 everyday, the risk in case of a fire is very high.  There was not a single fire bucket.  Unfazed by the poor emergency facility, HC Kapoor, the maintenance in charge of Sri Ram Tower, said, “We will bring sand lying outside (in case of fire)”. 
Patrakarpuram
Shop owner Asharaf Alam Khan said, “This is a collective responsibility of the storekeepers and the management, but no one seems interested”.  Girash Bhargava, the chairman of the market association, said, “I have requested builders many times to install fire control and prevention mechanisms but they have turned a blind eye. ” Open wires across the ceiling portray the crucial need of maintenance.  TOI tried to contact Aarohi Builders but they were unavailable.  So was Devendra Gupta, the chairman of the market association. 
Bhootnath
Over 3,000 staff and visitors are present in Bhootnath Market at any given time.  There were no fire extinguishers and the two entry and exit routes were clogged by hawkers and vehicles, making it impossible for a fire tender to approach.  “Law says there should be space for a fire tender to enter a market but that’s not possible here,” a shopkeeper said.  Basic precautions such as sand buckets and alarms were missing.  Several eateries were using cylinders in the basement.  Devendra Gupta, the chairman of the market association, remained unavailable.

Ruckus at private hospital in Gomtinagar  LUCKNOW: Parents of a youth who had died at a private hospital in Gomtinagar started protesting against the hospital administration late on Sunday.  The kin of the child alleged death took place due to medical negligence while the hospital administration cited complications for sudden deterioration of the youth’s health. 
Motorcycle borne Girdhari Lal (22) had met with an accident at Deva road, Chinhat.  Lal was rushed to the hospital that is located near Patrakarpuram crossing in Vikas Khand locality of Gomtinagar. 
His kin alleged that Lal died around 5pm but the hospital administration took two hours to share the news.  Upset with the youth’s death, the relatives and kin created a ruckus outside the hospital.

Traffic jams as cops take festive break  LUCKNOW: As police personnel took the Rakshabandhan off en mass, traffic movement took a beating and there was congestion at half a dozen places in the city with a large number of families stepping out to indulge in festivities.  Several home guards and policemen were on leave leaving a small number to man the streets. 
Dozens of motor vehicles were parked around 1090 crossing and before the Hazratganj crossing as families enjoyed ice creams or eatables and descended on the streets at the same time.  Though traffic movement was not hit, congestion was felt in Hazratganj, Bhootnath Market, Patrakarpuram, Kapoorthala, Powerhouse, Chandannagar and Barabirwa.

Timed traffic lights at 17 crossings from next week  LUCKNOW: Drivers in the city would now know when exactly to turn the engine off and start again at busy traffic crossings.  An exhaustive survey carried out jointly by traffic wing of city police and Lucknow Municipal Corporation concluded on Monday and it was decided that synchronised traffic signals would be functional at 17 intersections in the city next week.  Most of the crossings covered in the first phase would fall on the Polytechnic-Nishatganj-Charbagh route and gradually 23 more traffic signals would be equipped with timers on the lines of metro cities. 
A trial run is on at Hazratganj crossing and traffic is being regulated with the help of time-based signals for eight hours in a day.  Additional superintendent of traffic police, Habibul Hasan said Lucknowites need to respect the rules and not take it lightly.  âAt metro cities, motorists wait for signal to turn green even if no traffic cop is deputed.  In Lucknow, people follow rules only if policemen are deputed and break rules some times even in their presence,â said Hasan. 
With the help of cameras, errant motorists would be identified and e-challan issued.  In the next phase, traffic directorate of UP police is planning to set up dozens of kiosks across the city to collect fine.  Same method is followed by Bengaluru, Delhi, Pune and Mumbai traffic units. 
In the survey, two-wheeler and four-wheeler-borne traffic cops plied between Polytechnic, Badshahnagar, Sikandarbagh, Hazratganj, Charbagh, Alambagh to Shahid Path crossing in Sarojininagar route for five days last week.  Usual time spent on each signal had been recorded.  The synchronisation of the entire route had been done in accordance. 
The only hurdle in proper implementation of the system is VIP culture.  Though the designated VIP route is AmausiâBarabirwaâJail roadâCanttâBandariyabagh, top politicians, governor and judges often crisscross in the city via Hazratganj crossing.  âWe are left with no choice but to regulate the crossing manually then,â said an officer who did not want to be named. 
The places where syncronised signals would be placed in the first leg are Sikandarbagh, Sapru Marg turn, Power corporation building, Hazratganj, Bapu Bhawan, Burlington, Hussainganj, KKC trisection and two places opposite Charbagh railway station, Alambagh among other busy crossings up to Amausi airport.  Gradually, Patrakarpuram, Munshipulia, IT crossing, Parivartan Chowk would be included.

Lucknow cop kicks elderly steno off cycle track, pics go viral  LUCKNOW: Reckless act of a sub-inspector generated a lot of flak for city police on Saturday.  Thousands of online users from all over the country, expressed anguish over photographs in which sub-inspector Pradeep Kumar, posted in Hazratganj police station was seen misbehaving with an elderly man.  The victim, 65-year-old Krishna Kumar is seen in the pictures standing with folded hands trying to plead his case with the cop.  Support for Kumar and call for punishment against the cop, poured in from all over the country.  Actress Parineeti Chopra, film critic Rajeev Masand and former VJ and comic artist Jose Covaco retweeted the overwhelming images that went viral on social media. 
All Kumar wanted was that the Rs 5,000 worth typewriter survives wrath of the cop.  But that did not happen.  âHe was violent and kept abusing us.  I said, I would not sit near the cycle track in the future and to forgive me this time.  My requests did not work.  He threw the typewriter on the road and kicked it several times,â said Kumar. 
Kumar resides near Patrakarpuram in Gomtinagar along with wife, son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter.  Kumarâs son runs a roadside grocery store.  The family of five survives on less than Rs 10,000 a month.  Kumar makes about Rs 70 to 100 a day and had spent three decades typing applications, letters and affidavits near General Post Office.

Pradeep knocked down a utensil filled with milk and scattered eatables the tea vendor had kept on road.  Kumar had bought the typewriter three years back for Rs 5,000 in exchange of the old one.  He is senior most among five typists who sit near GPO.  âEveryone gathered in my support.  Men in uniform have no regard for the poor,â added Kumar. 
Though it was not clear what prompted Pradeep to react in this manner, two theories were doing the rounds.  Pradeep wanted to extort more money from roadside vendors or had been pulled up for allowing vendors to encroach over cycle tracks.  As per sources, VIP movement was scheduled around the stretch and Pradeep wanted to clear it.

Schoolgirl found near Gomtinagar, kidnap alleged  LUCKNOW: Student of a prominent school located in Vishal Khand in Gomtinagar, who appeared for exam on Monday was found along Gomti bandha around 1.30pm under highly mysterious circumstances.  The girl's mother filed a police complaint accusing two unidentified bike-borne miscreants of ‘kidnapping’ her. 
The class XI student left her house in the morning for school along with her younger brother who is in class IX in the same school.  Residents of Vivek Khand-III see the two minor siblings commute on Honda Activa, as they did on Monday.  The two were appearing for an exam. 
Her mother said the girl was heading back home in an auto rickshaw when two bike-borne miscreants gagged her and abducted her while she was walking home after getting off the auto rickshaw.  The miscreants had allegedly taken the girl all the way up to the bandha road in Gomtinagar Extension.  Some residents of Saraswati apartment spotted the girl in distress and alerted cops. 
Policemen reached the spot and a manhunt was launched to spot the culprits.  The girl was taken to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for medical examination and her parents were informed.  “After talking to her, the girl’s mother told us there was no need for thorough check up.  A contusion was seen on the girl’s head,” said circle officer of Gomtinagar police station DySP Satyasen Yadav.  FIR under IPC charges 363 (kidnapping) and 308 (attempt to culpable homicide) was registered against the miscreants. 
The girl left with her parents.  Her grandfather Shyam Narayan who runs a jwellery shop in Gomtinagar told TOI, “She is shocked and extremely disturbed.  We are also unaware of the exact sequence of events and at this point we are only waiting for her to recover completely,” said Prasad.  The girl’s father is general manager of a sugar mill in Gujarat.

Police probe shows otherwise In police investigations, it turned out that the 16-year-old was caught cheating in the exam hall on Monday morning.  Though the exam was to end at 12 noon, the girl left the classroom under the pretext of relieving herself.  “The school cameras caught her leaving the compound around 11.22am,” said officer-in-charge of Gomtinagar police station sub-inspector Shyam Babu Shukla. 
A resident of Saraswati apartment V K Singh had called police around 1.35pm on spotting the girl moving aimlessly next to the bandha road.  Police were trying to probe what transpired in the two hours with the help of cameras installed at Patrakarpuram and other locations in Vishal Khand-II. 
The duo allegedly abducted the girl and hit her on the head before dumping her at the bandha, as per complaint.  Police were trying to piece together the sequence of events with the help of CCTV cameras and were waiting for the girl to give her statement.

Asked to pay Rs 20 bus fare, goons whip out guns  LUCKNOW: Traffic came to standstill at Dalibagh and local residents ran for cover as a rowdy group of about 10 barged inside a city bus near Narmada Bhawan on Tuesday noon.  Two middle-aged men had boarded the bus from Ashok Marg at 11.30am.  The bus (registration number UP 32 EZ 4737) plying on route number 11 (Scooter India to BBD university via Alambagh, Charbagh, Patrakarpuram) was packed with daily commuters. 
The duo wanted to get off at Tilak Marg.  The bus conductor asked for the fare, but the two were ready to pay only Rs 10 instead of Rs 20.  An argument broke out between them and the bus conductor Dharmendra Verma.

Valluvarkottam,"As polls near, corpn speeds up flyover work  CHENNAI: Contrary to popular belief, Corporation of Chennai can move at extraordinary speed — when it’s required to.  With the assembly elections likely around May 2016 and the election notification date round the corner, the corporation is going at full steam to complete delayed grade separator and flyover projects worth more than Rs 2,000 crore. 
Under fire for not doing anything to reduce traffic congestion, the civic body has decided to build six new flyovers and rail over-bridges of the 12 it promised earlier. 
The corporation has not build any new flyovers in the city since AIADMK took charge of the council but completed those on which the civic body under the previous DMK regime had started construction.  The present council’s plan to widen key stretches has also come to naught because of problems with land acquisition even though motorists continue to struggle on increasingly crowded and narrow stretches. 
Of the six proposed projects, the civic body is likely to first float tenders for a proposed Rs 118-crore rail over-bridge to connect Ennore High Road and Manali High Road.  It will follow that with a Rs 60-crore rail over-bridge connecting Villivakkam and Kolathur. 
Corporation officials said they will in the next corporation council place a proposal for a grade separator connecting Anna Salai and Mahalingapuram by integrating the Usman Road flyovers.  They have completed detailed project report for the corporation’s longest flyover, a Rs 1,320-crore structure that will connect Ega Theatre and Valluvarkottam and that experts from IIT-M will soon vet. 
Officials said they have prepared an interim report for a flyover that will in the first phase connect Sardar Patel Road flyover and Rajiv Gandhi Salai (the IT Expressway).  The officials said they would, in the second phase, connect OMR and Adyar with another flyover but are still undecided on the details of the plan. 
The civic body also proposes to construct another grade separator connecting Velachery Aquatic Complex and Guru Nanak College on Velachery High Road. 
Civic officials said they scrapped a 3.25km flyover to connect Vadapalani bus depot and La Chatelaine School on Arcot Road because of the proposed mono rail project.  They’ve also abandoned plans for a grade separator near Crowne Plaza Chennai (formerly Hotel Park Sheraton) and another on Gandhi Mandapam Salai in Kotturpuram on the advice of a consultant. 
The corporation also binned a proposal for a flyover in Mandaiveli junction near Mandaiveli bus stand after residents opposed the project and postponed two flyovers — one on Bharathi Salai and another connecting Adhithanar Salai, Pantheon Road and Dr Rukmani Lakshmipathy Road — because of metro rail work. 
Experts have pointed out to the civic body that flyovers most often do not ease traffic congestion. 
“The flyovers in Adyar and T Nagar have shown that flyovers only cause congestion at certain points while relieving traffic at other points,” former Anna University urban engineering professor K P Subramaniam said.  “Many developed countries are now demolishing flyovers as it gets choked because of too much vehicles. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  40K homes show way to clean Chennai  After empty claims and false starts, the city's efforts at segregation of waste at households (source segregation) seem to be slowly yielding results.  Five days after the corporation did a soft launch of source segregation on Gandhi Jayanti, TOI has found that North Chennai, which is considered `dirtier', has done a better job than the southern part of the city when it comes to separating dry waste and biodegradable waste. 
Of the 85.66 tonnes of dry waste collected from the city in the first two days, Central Chennai which consists of Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar, Ambattur, Anna Nagar and Teynampet collected the maximum with 37.6 tonnes. North Chennai (25.62 tonnes) came second, ahead of South Chennai (16.72 tonnes). 
Corporation officials said residents in North Chennai which consists of Thiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram, Tondiarpet and Royapuram have shown more interest than the southern neighbourhoods of Valasaravakkam, Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi and Sholinganallur.  “Now about 40,000 households are doing it,“ said an official. 
Though the civic body has collected just 1% of the segregated waste of the total garbage the city generated in two days, experts say it is a good start.  If 50% of homes do segregation, the solid waste going into the two dump yards ­ Kodungaiyur and Perungudi ­ will be reduced to half.  Whenever the city corporation and NGOs tried to spread awareness about source seg regation of waste, a majority of residents had excuses not to fall in line.  Some said unless it is imposed across the country , it will be of no use since garbage collectors would anyway mix the waste segregated at some homes with the rest of the trash. Some others found it to be a time-consuming exercise amidst their busy schedule.  Yet others complained of none coming to collect segregated waste at their doorstep. 
A few neighbourhoods have remained an exception, segregating waste for several years without any support from the corporation.  Now, with the corporation's latest effort looking promising -some 40,000 households do source segregation -the example set by people like Nalini Ravendran has gained a bigger purpose.  Ravendran, a resident of Lakshmipuram, not only separates wet and dry waste, but also composts the biodegradable part using three-tier terracotta pots called `khambas'.  “I've been doing it for 12 years,“ she said.  “Kham bas is a simple way to convert organic waste into manure.  This is affordable and requires little space. “ She said everyone in the city should segregate waste before complaining about littered streets.  J Bhagavathy , 66, a resident of Maheswari Apartments in Valluvarkottam says the residents' association has provided two big containers for families to dump waste.  “It's not a Herculean task.  We are glad that the corporation is now extending it to other parts of the city .  It should now ensure that workers collect garbage regularly from houses,“ said Bhagavathy . 
The corporation's data shows a majority of houses are yet to follow suit.  “Conservancy inspectors in many zones are yet to enforce it.  Some people are unaware of it, some just don't care.  We hope the attitude changes in the coming days,“ said an official. 
The corporation has set up at least one composting plant in each of the 15 zones.  The aim is to increase the number of such plants to 45.  In Kodambakkam zone, it has started giving 5kg manure as an incentive for those who give segregated garbage.  In Madhavaram, civic officials source rotten vegetables and fruits from nearby supermarkets.  The civic body will also reward conservancy inspectors who collect the maximum dry waste from residents.  “We are also identifying vacant plots, parks, burial grounds and group bins as dry waste-sorting centres, said the official.  The civic body is in talks with scrap dealers to buy recyclable waste. Plastic waste will be used for road laying. 
Environmentalist Dharmesh Shah said the civic body should involve more residents.  “Many people are unaware about the corporation's source segregation plan as they are yet to engage them,“ Shah said.

Govt responsible for flood disaster: Ex-mayor  Flooding of Chennai was the result of keeping a directionless, inept administration in office for more than four years, said former mayor of Chennai M Subramanian in an interview to TOI.  Excerpts from the interview: Do you think the flood disaster could have been mitigated? Natural calamity cannot be prevented.  But the magnitude of the disaster could have been avoided.  That is the job of the government.  People suffered because the government failed in its duty.  About 1,450 crore worth drainage projects, started in 2010 and scheduled to be completed two years ago, are not yet over owing to poor supervision by mayor and officials, and extortion by avaricious councillors.  The corporation has not initiated any step to construct drains in the expanded areas till now.  The capacity of the existing drains shrunk by 90% due to not desilting.  Our mayor Saidai Duraisamy does not know the difference between sewerage and storm-water drains.  What do you think should have been done? Going by the experience of handling floods in 1985, 1995 and 2005, we should have been better prepared.  It is government’s mistake that it did not take the forecast of unprecedented rains seriously.  Adequate warning was not given to people to move to safe places before releasing water.  As per your estimate what is the death toll? This government does not speak the truth.  The government’s figure of 350-odd deaths is fudged.  The actual toll could be much more in Chennai alone.  Some deaths were registered only after the victims’ relatives threatened to stage agitations.  Aren’t successive governments responsible for encouraging housing projects in low-lying agricultural wetlands which were once flood course of reservoirs and lakes? As population of the city increased, people had to be accommodated.  Many parts of the present-day Chennai city like Spurtank road and Valluvarkottam were once lakes.  Isn’t DMK also responsible for encouraging slums on river banks? The DMK government rehabilitated more than 70,000 families living along Chennai waterways.  The previous DMK government tied up with Singapore government to beautify Cooum river.  Three stretches of Cooum banks were cleared and developed as parks by us.  But, like many other projects initiated by us, the river restoration work also was put on hold by the AIADMK government.  If you were the mayor, what would be your top priorities now? This is the right time to remove all encroachments along rivers.  Many educational institutions have encroached upon rivers and lakes.  All of them should be evicted without any mercy.  A councillor at Manapakkam has encroached upon a lake bed and constructed 21 houses.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Chennai today Religion

The fans had initially planned a protest at Valluvarkottam without police permission but later assembled outside the actor’s house in T.  Nagar and spoke to the media, voicing their support for him. 
“We think that people working against him have taken advantage of this situation and have been unnecessarily targeting him,” said Sathish, head of the actor’s fans association for Chennai.  Simbu fans voice their support for actor Simbu fans voice their support for the actor
Members of Chennai Simbu fan clubs associations said on Monday that it was unfair to target the actor when he had not released the controversial ‘Beep’ song himself. 
“When the song has been leaked, why is the actor being questioned and hounded,” they asked. 
The fans had initially planned a protest at Valluvarkottam without police permission but later assembled outside the actor’s house in T.  Nagar and spoke to the media, voicing their support for him. 
“We think that people working against him have taken advantage of this situation and have been unnecessarily targeting him,” said Sathish, head of the actor’s fans association for Chennai.  – Staff Reporter DMK members stage walkout over allegations against Karunanidhi, Stalin Councillors of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) staged a walkout from the council meeting on Tuesday, accusing the ruling All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Mayor Saidai Duraisamy of simply targeting DMK leaders M. K.  Karunanidhi and M. K.  Stalin for the Chennai floods. 
During the meeting, the Mayor alleged that Mr.  Karunanidhi was responsible for the shrinking of the Adyar river to 59 metres near Nandambakkam and 83.3 metres near Saidapet in the city limits.  “In 1967, when he was the Public Works Department Minister, he brought workers from Thiruvarur as a part of Cooum beautification and allowed them to encroach upon the river banks,” he said, and added that that even a lake at Valluvarkottam was encroached upon by them. 
Responding to allegations about the excess discharge of Chembarambakkam water coupled with inaction by officials as the reason for flooding, Mr.  Duraisamy said the highest rainfall recorded in 100 years along with excess water from lakes and channels that had drained into the Adyar river caused flooding in most areas. 
“We had initiated enough preventive measures and informed people living near the river about the rising water level only after which the water discharge from Chembarambakkam began,” he said. 
Subhash Chandra Bose, Leader of the Opposition, said the Mayor was levying baseless allegations against their party leaders to divert attention from the real reasons for the flooding.  “If they had de-silted channels and waterbodies, and evacuated people, the effects of the disaster could have been largely avoided,” he said, after walking out of the meeting with the rest of the councillors. 
Chaos prevailed in the meeting after they engaged in a verbal altercation with the Mayor and AIADMK councillors, also stating that it had become a thanksgiving meeting for Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and that the real work by volunteers and NGOs in rescue operations was not recognised.  They left the premises of Ripon Buildings after shouting slogans against the Mayor and the AIADMK.

Rupi Palace,"Police recovers idols, valuables stolen from Raghunathji temple in Kullu SHIMLA: In a major breakthrough, the Special Investigation Team has recovered all the idols, including the gold idol of Lord Raghunath installed in 16th century, and other valuables stolen from Raghunathji temple in Kullu in December last year, police said today. 
The SIT recovered the idol of Raghunathji from Bajaura on border of Mandi and Kullu districts while the idol of Lord Hanuman, a gold plated Narsinh Shila (stone), silver idol of Lord Ganesh, a gold locket and a chain, and some other articles of worship were recovered from Beasa Mor, ADGP (law and order) Sanjay Kundu said. 
The SIT had reliable information that the stolen idols and valuables were not taken out of Himachal Pradesh and had been hidden in different parts of the state. 
The high profile theft in Raghunathji temple had sent shock waves in Kullu region as Lord Raghunathji was presiding deity of 300 local deities and people pay obeisance to him during the historic Kullu Dussehra festival. 
The SIT had zeroed in on some suspects and intensive investigations helped in detecting the exact location of the places where the stolen idols had been hidden, Kundu said. 
The state police had sounded Interpol alert and announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for providing credible information about the thieves and later sketches of some suspects were prepared on the basis of CCTV footage and released to the media. 
A prime suspect is reported to have fled to Nepal, he said, adding, more details about the modus operandi adopted by the police in cracking the case would be disclosed later. 
The idol of Ragunathji which was supposed to be thousands of years old was brought to Kullu from Ayodhya in sixteenth century and was installed in Raghunathji temple at Sultanpur in Rupi Palace of Raja of Kullu. 
The idols were stolen on the intervening night of December 9 and 10 last year. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kovilkadavu,"A ‘marathon’ to deliver letters He is believed to be the only ‘Anchalottakaran’ (postal runner) in the State who can shed light on the postal system in the Anchunadu valley in the erstwhile Travancore. 
At his ramshackle house at Kanakkayamkudy, near the forest check-post at Kovilkadavu between Marayur and Kanthalloor, Chapli Kannan tries to piece together memories of those days.  He claims he is over 90. 
He was the postal runner connecting Kanthalloor and Marayoor, the two ‘oorus’ (villages) in the Anchunadu valley comprising Marayur, Kanthalloor, Karayoor, Keezhanthoor, and Kottagudy (now in Tamil Nadu). 
Holding a bell, his work would start at 6.30 a. m.  from his house at Kanakkayamkudy to the Kanthalloor ‘post office’ (a distance of 8 km).  From there, Kannan collected postal articles and would run to the Marayur post office and after handing over the articles and collecting materials from there would reach Kanthalloor (a distance of 32 km) and return home. 
Kannan said he started the work at the age of 17 and continued till India Post took over the services.  He had to leave the job sans any benefit. 
He said he had the right to confront anyone who prevented his way and used to carried a weapon.  The sound of the bell alerted the people about the movement of articles between the two villages. 
Kannan said he received Rs.31 a month though his salary was fixed at Re.1 a day.  “It was not a bad salary then,” he says. 
All important articles, including cash, were then handed over through the system, he said adding that the addressee had to collect the items from the offices as there was no one to deliver them. 
In The Facets of 100 Years’ Planting , published by Tata-Finlay Ltd. , there is a reference of the postal system in the British-ruled Munnar. 
As per the book, officials from the U. K.  posted at Munnar had to apply for leave through post and one had to wait at least a month to get sanction from the British East India Company’s headquarters there. 
An ‘Anchalottakaran’ sheds light on the postal system in Anchunadu valley Suspected yellow leaf disease hits areca nut crop Symptoms of what is believed to be yellow leaf disease is being witnessed in the Marayur region, raising fears that it will engulf the entire areca nut cultivation there. 
Last year, root-wilt disease with the same symptoms had spread among coconut trees in the area and experts’ opinion on controlling it proved ineffective.  Tender coconut on disease-affected trees withered and started decaying.  Once a plot was affected with the disease, it fast engulfed the entire area.  The farmers were left with no option but to destroy the trees. 
It is believed that the same disease has now affected the arecanut trees, with the leaf in the inner whorl yellowing and then spreading to the outer whorl of the crown.  The trunk breaks off at the top, and rotting of roots has also been reported.  The nut is reduced in size, the kernel turns black, the top decays, and finally the tree is killed. 
Experts said phytoplasma was the disease-causing agent, and the disease had already affected hundreds of acres of both coconut and areca nut palms.  The affected trees are mainly at Nachivayal, Anachalpetty and Kovilkadavu in Marayur and Chanalmedu, Missionvayal and Cheruvadu in Kanthallur. 
An official of the Agriculture Department told The Hindu on Monday that a wide area in Marayur had already fallen to the disease.  “Earlier we thought that it was a microplasm-like organism and directions were given to the farmers on counter measures.  However it was found that the controlling measures were ineffective and the disease fast spread to new areas,” he said. 
Farmers said coconut and arecanut palms on hundreds of acres were cut down in the last six months.   Uzhavil Jose of Nachivayal said after the outer leaves turned yellow, the top of the tree started decaying within a month.  “When the disease affected coconut trees, we applied pest control measures suggested by the Krishi Bhavan.  However, it proved ineffective and the disease fast spread to nearby areas,” he said. 
Agriculture Department officials said the failure to take continuous disease-control measures was the reason for the spread of the disease. 
Block technology manager Manikandan said a team of pathologists from the Kerala Agricultural University would visit the farms on July 20, 21 and 22 and interact with the farmers. 
It is also suspected that could be a new disease that has affected the area.  Kanthallur, Marayur lose out on paddy : Kanthallur and Marayur, which were once known as the rice bowl of Devikulam taluk, have lost their fame over the last two decades. 
Several factors played a role in the shifting of cultivation in the two areas — Kanthallur had become mostly a vegetable cultivating village and Marayur was under sugarcane cultivation.  Farmers say the shift in agriculture practices came about when paddy cultivation became unprofitable and there was shortage of labour. 
According to an estimate at the Marayur Krishi Bhavan, paddy cultivation had shrunk from 2,000 acres to a mere 25 acres.  In Kanthallur, it had fallen from  2,500 acres of land to 100 acres.  An official at the Krishi Bhavan told The HIndu that the two villages had been completely under paddy cultivation of many endemic varieties.

Vegetable or sugarcane cultivation posed no environmental threat.  However, now a vast area in the two villages has been converted into grandis cultivation.  Grandis cultivation has caused depletion of groundwater in the two villages, sources said. 
In Kanthallur, areas like Masi, Keezhanthur and Kovilkadavu were under paddy cultivation till recently.  The main varieties were champa, Kuttalam and Vellanellu.  Though the panchayat provided the seed and fertilizers to promote paddy cultivation, it could not do much to help preserve paddy farming, said S.  Madhavan, grama panchayat president.  He said in a few years, paddy cultivation would be completely stopped. 
Keezhanthur Padasekhara Samithy is the only one of its kind in the panchayat.  Under the samithy, 43 acres of land were brought under paddy cultivation.  Earlier the Mahatma Gandhi National Ruiral; Employment Guarantee Scheme was utilised to promote paddy cultivation.  But, a bar on this during 2013-14 brought the entire effort in the reverse gear, said Mr.  Madhavan. 
According to the official of the Krishi Bhavan, it is difficult to resume paddy cultivation after the land is utilised for other cultivation. 
Scarce water
As water sources became scarce, farmers shifted to cash crops.  If paddy cultivation is to be restored, there should be a concrete plan to ensure that farmers do not suffer losses.  The soil and the climatic conditions in the two villages are best suited for paddy cultivation.

Panchal Ghat Durwasa Ashram,"Four children drowned in Ganga at Panchal Ghat in Farrukhabad district  KANPUR: Four children drowned in Ganga at Panchal Ghat in Farrukhabad district.  They were identified as Phoolkali (9), Ranjit (8), Adesh (6) and Anshika (11), all natives of Talihar village in Shajahanpur district.  The police said the accident took place when the children had gone for a bath in Ganga at Panchal Ghat Durwasa Ashram. 
The incident took place in the morning hours when five kids Anshika (11) Makhanlal (10) Phoolkali (9), Ranjit (8) and Adesh (6), all natives of Talihar village in Shahjahanpur, who had come to Panchal Ghat Durwasa Ashram of Farrukhabad along with their elders to take part in a religious discourse, went for a bath in river Ganga.  Eyewitnesses said they entered into the main current of the river.  Within minutes, the five started to call out for calling for help as they struggled to stay afloat. 
Hearing the victims’ cries, the local shopkeepers jumped into the river and managed to rescue one Makhan Lal while the four others went missing.  They immediately alerted the Panchalghat police. 
The rescue team later pulled out Anshika (11) Phoolkali (9), Ranjit (8) and Adesh (6).

Chellappa Gounder Street,"Little progress in shifting out temples, shops from Gandhipuram The progress in shifting three temples and 100-plus shops from near the flyover construction site in Gandhipuram is at snail’s pace. 
Or, so it appears from what the officials tell The Hindu .  The Coimbatore Corporation, after rejecting the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department plea for alternative site near the prison grounds, has identified a land in Kattoor for shifting the Muniappan Temple, Siddhi Vinayagar Temple and Muthu Mariamman Temple. 
On this land near the Chellappa Gounder Street, the Corporation will provide around 2,400 sq. ft.  to each of the three temples. 
The Corporation has readied this and submitted the proposal to the authorities concerned for further action, the sources say and add that it is now for the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department to act.  The latest is that the proposal is under the consideration of the Commissioner of the Department. 
Likewise, the civic body has suggested two sites for shifting the 150-odd shops. 
The civic body was forced to find alternative sites after the lorry drivers at the parking area near the Power House and Coimbatore North Railway Station said that it would be difficult for them to give up the place. 
With the stretch of land near the Tangedco sub-station on Ukkadam By-pass Road as the first option and the stretch of land near the sewage treatment plant site on Nanjundapuram Road as the second option, the civic body has submitted a proposal to the authorities concerned for further action and are yet to hear from them. 
The sources say that the civic body has done its part by identifying alternative sites and it is for the authorities concerned to act. 
Meanwhile, the vehicles make slow progress in the Gandhipuram area as files move from one department to another. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swarlagondi,"Bifurcation hits AIDS Control Society activities In the absence of new programmes, the Krishna district unit of the State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) is idling away precious time with a fond hope that the body will be bifurcated by March-end and activities will resume from the next financial year. 
Sources in the department say except for implementation of Deepika Smart Card for HIV+ patients in VAMBAY Colony in the city, no new initiatives could be introduced in the last several months.  The Smart Card covers five health aspects: addiction to smoking, drugs, etc; suspicion of tuberculosis; marital status, travel for long distances; any reproductive tract infections and sexually transmitted infections.  Designed as a self-evaluating system, people can fill the smart card, evaluate the grades and determine, on their own, if they are vulnerable to contracting HIV/AIDS. 
After a long gap, the authorities met at Visakhapatnam recently to review the progress of various initiatives.  The APSACS continues to be one body for two States, which is seen as the cause for many existing problems. 
Bifurcation of the State has resulted in slowing down of a series of programmes launched by the SACS to control the spread of the virus.  It was almost a norm to launch most of the pilot programmes of the AIDS Control Society either in Vijayawada or in Guntur.  But the ‘disturbance’ due to the bifurcation process has resulted in a lull in the activities. 
The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode embraced by the SACS to reach out to a wider section of population afflicted by the virus has, however, shown some positive impact in Krishna district. 
With a view to provide HIV prevention, care and treatment to sections that remained outside the realm of its services, the APSACS has roped in private hospitals and nursing homes.  Under the PPP model, the department would provide logistic support like HIV test kits and disposable delivery kits to the ‘positive’ patients visiting private hospitals.  It would also extend technical support in terms of capacity building, regular monitoring and evaluation. 
“This year, we have roped in 18 private hospitals in Krishna district.  The collaboration helps us conduct HIV tests and distribute HIV kits to those identified as ‘positive’,” says T. V. S. N.  Sastry, District AIDS Control Officer. 
“We have brought into our fold even the newly-opened Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in remote areas like Swarlagondi in Nagayalanka mandal and Edurumondi,” says Mr.  Sastry.

Yusmarg,"Single window clearance for tourism projects: Jammu and Kashmir CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed SRINAGAR; Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today announced a "" single window""  for project clearance in a time-bound manner to fast-track approvals for laying high-end tourism infrastructure in the state. 
"" There is a need to promote 'Business with Ease' and the Single Window will facilitate creation of high-end facilities with global benchmarks,""  Sayeed said, chairing a high level meeting here. 
He said his government would remove hurdles to facilitate brand tie-ups so that high-end intake capacity of the state, which is presently low is substantially increased to draw overseas and top-class domestic visitors to the state. 
"" A high-powered Committee will be framed that will facilitate creation of brand infrastructure to attract international tourist footfall to the state,""  he said. 
Asking for a concerted effort to promote J&K as a top-class golf destination with week-end and week-long packages, the Chief Minister called for an organized publicity campaign to promote golf tourism in the state. 
"" We already have golf circuits at Srinagar, Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sidhra.  We are exploring possibilities of laying new courses at Sonamarg, Sanasar and Yusmarg for which feasibility reports are being prepared,""  Sayeed said, adding Kashmir Golf Club, one of the oldest courses in the country, will also be refurbished to attract golf lovers. 
He urged the top stakeholders in tourism industry to employ local youth in their hospitality and human resource divisions, saying expansion of tourism infrastructure would create countless employment opportunities in the services sector. 
"" Our youth are greatly talented in HR and Hospitality segments and I am sure they will do a fairly good job at the cutting-edge level,""  he asserted.  Opposition to Bojpathri firing range proposal gains momentum SRINAGAR: Adventure Tour Operators Association of Kashmir (ATOAK) and J&K Ski and Mountaineering Association (JKSMA) in a joint meeting held at Srinagar took a strong note of Army Firing Range proposed to come up at Bojpathri in Yusmarg area of Kashmir. 
We are dismayed to learn that the army is asking for the permission to build a firing range in the vicinity of world famous tourist resort of Yusmarg, a joint press communiqué said here today.  This virgin and pristine area will face enormously environmental degradation if such a plan is implemented. 
President ATOAK, Rauf Tramboo who presided over the meeting said the move will prove environmentally disastrous as this virgin place is very fragile, the Karewa land beneath this mountain range which is holding the entire weight of solid rock face of Pir Panjal Mountains will also get affected besides it will prove harmful to the water bodies, horticulture and agricultural land of this area thus directly affecting a large population living in this area. 
The move will also damage the tourism departments plans to promote this area for Adventure and Pilgrim tourism, the adventure tour operators who have been selling this area for different adventure activities for both summer and winter will face cancellations of current bookings and this area will be total loss for any future adventure tourism activities, beside Pilgrim tourism will also get blow as the area is famous for many revered shrines at Chari Sharief and Pakhar Pora, he said. 
Tourism and presence of army in the pristine areas for whatever purposes cant go together, ATOAK and JKSMA urges the government to desist from any such move as this misadventure can prove disastrous not only to society at large but it will affect environmentally and culturally to every other place of Kashmir valley. 
ATOAK and JKSMA together will fight tooth and nail if any such a plan is implemented at Bojpathri or any other place in Jammu and Kashmir, we have already suffered a lot and will not allow anyone to vandalise our ecology, environment and resources
Meanwhile, J&K RTI movement vociferously opposed the Government’s proposal to shift firing range to Bajpathri-Yousmarg. 
Founding Chairman JKRTIM and Chief Patron of Tossamaidan Bachao Front, Dr Shaikh Ghulam Rasool stated, we reject such a devastating move by the government, where human life and environment is under a constant threat. 
Dr Shaikh, in his statement said, we will launch a strong campaign against this decision and will support the Save Yousmarg campaign, to further deepen the mission. 
We fail to understand why is the government so adamant to make human life even more vulnerable, when the consequences of putting up a firing range in Tossamaidan, have been already witnessed.  Wherein, 65 people lost their lives and over 300 people are permanently disabled. 
Devastation of flora and fauna, biodiversity and various water bodies is so immense that it will continue to impact our future generations, he said. 
He added, shifting the firing range to Yousmarg, does implicate much devastation than was caused by TosaMaidan. 
Prima facie, it means threat to the thousands of families of Nomadic tribes and their livestock.  Second, it will have impact (ranging from severe to mild) on atleast six districts of J&K.  Third, the irrigation and drinking water schemes of Frasnag and Doodhganga will be contaminated and wrecked down in the long run.  And last but not the least, it means hammering down the Tourism industry, as many tourism destination stay nearby. 
The RTI activists harshly criticised government’s anti people policies and said, we will not allow Government/Army to ruin our people, our land, our forests and our Environment. 
People of Tosamaidan will also stand in close cooperation with the inhabitants of  Yousmarg, as every Kashmiri stood with them, when they fought the battle against Tosamaidan firing range, said Dr Shaikh.

Indira Dam,"Flesh in Indira dam: Pollution board to test water  LUCKNOW Police started investigating on Wednesday to find the source of flesh found stuck in the regulator at the Indira Dam a day before, while UP Pollution Control Board will begin taking samples of the water to know the level of contamination.  The authorities at state irrigation department would initiate the exercise for the removal of the flesh from the water on Thursday. 
On Tuesday, an estimated 25 quintals of flesh was found floating near the regulator of Indira Dam.  The matter came to light when residents in Juggaur village complained of a pungent smell.  The sighting pressed alarm bells among people as the dam feeds Kathautha Jheel (via Sharda Canal)—a primary source of drinking water to more than 8 lakh homes in trans-Gomti area. 
Officials deployed at Indira Dam regulator have also expressed possibility of water in Kathautha Jheel getting polluted because of the flesh.  Authorities at Lucknow Jal Sansthan said there was no reason to worry. 
When contacted, jal sansthan general manager Rajeev Bajpai said: “There is no threat to drinking water supply in trans-Gomti area being contaminated as the direction of point where flesh was found was against the flow.  This would save contamination of water towards Sharda canal which feeds Kathauta jheel.  But, all necessary precautions are being taken. ”
Taking note of the matter, local police has initiated investigation to find out the source of flesh.  Meanwhile, police probe to find out the source of such a large quantity of flesh could not yield any information.  Chinhat station officer Shashi Shekhar Yadav claimed: “It is possible the flesh was thrown into Indira canal’s stretch that falls in Barabanki district and we are in touch with our counterparts there to trace the culprit. ”
Meanwhile, health experts have expressed concern over the matter besides prescribing caution.  Gomtinagar extension based general physician, Dr D P Mishra said contaminated water could lead to a number of gastro-intestinial diseases.  “Though most households have water filters, many are not equipped to fight with virus or bacteria.  Boiling water before consumption could help,” he stated.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Bangur Nagar,"Trees hacked in Malad business hub  MUMBAI: The BMC registered a non-cognizable complaint with the police on Thursday in connection with trees being cut in Malad.  Parminder Singh Bhamra, a local corporator from the area, said some locals had informed him about the greenery being destroyed at Malad Link Road.  When he reached the spot, he saw trees were being cut by some people opposite Inorbit Mall. 
The area is a prime business hub, said Bhamra, a tree committee member in the BMC.  “I strongly feel a developer is involved in this case.  I immediately informed ward officials and they called the police to the spot.  We cannot let trees be cut such a way,” said Bhamra. 
Senior inspector, Bangur Nagar police station, Dnyaneshwar Jawalkar, said, “The BMC registered a non-cognizable complaint on Thursday in connection with trees being cut at Malad.  Further investigation is on.  The trees were on private land. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Youth held for cheating 10 women  MUMBAI: The Bangur Nagar police arrested a 25-year-old married man for allegedly duping more than 10 women of their valuables on the pretext of marrying after befriending them through matrimonial websites. 
An MBA graduate, Firoz Shaikh, ran out of luck when police started hunting for him after he recently duped a divorcee of over Rs 2 lakh.  Shaikh met the woman to tie the knot but fled away with her valuables, leaving her at a mall in Malad a week ago. 
Shaikh, a Jogeshwari resident, confessed to committing the offence to earn fast money after he was jobless.  “Shaikh is married, but in a bid to get fast money, he targeted women on matrimonial websites.  He has made three different profiles under various pseudonyms to trap the women,” said a police officer.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Citizens connect through Whatsapp for fair milk prices  MUMBAI: The battle against overcharging by milk retailers has found strong support from common Mumbaikars.  Scores have signed up for a WhatsApp group on the issue and roped in the department of weights and measures as well, leading to a winning partnership. 
The core group is also planning a PIL against milk firms and the distribution network. 
One member is a brand consultant while another is a Diva lawyer who arrives for every meeting in south Mumbai.  Yet another is an ALM member from Goregaon, who says, during this past fortnight, he has turned “from citizen to activist”. 
Even Sanjay Pandey, controller of legal metrology, who is spearheading this initiative against overcharging, is proud of this WhatsApp group.  Its members report unscrupulous vendors, conduct field research and argue articulately before aggressive dealers and dairy owners.  “They strategize, plan, volunteer and arrive for meetings at the cost of their work.  It is heartwarming to see their wholehearted participation,” says Pandey. 
Young Adesh Bhagat arrived all the way from Diva to voice his anger at Saturday’s public meeting called by the department of legal metrology.  “Every retailer who is overcharging has complaints with dairy farms or the government.  None of them has a grievance with the common man.  Why are they then venting their anger on us helpless people?” he said to applause. 
Fifty-year-old computer software entrepreneur Sanjeev Agarwal says he was inspired by the Jaago Grahak Jaago campaign on TV.  “I have been observing the price of petrol and diesel reduce several times over the past year but the cost of milk continues to rise.  And then to have to pay Rs 2 more than MRP is terribly unfair.  How can dairies and retailers justify this?”
Agarwal says milk is already too expensive for a basic commodity.  He says, “As we began to debate on the group, we discovered the MRP includes storage, refrigeration and transportation costs.  Residents of all areas highlighted instances of overcharging.  We also found retailers have genuine grievances because their margins have not improved in years.  The big fish are the dairies who have the bargaining power against farmers and retailers. ”
A WhatsApp member from Bangur Nagar, Goregaon, Abhijit Banerjee, says, “We plan to educate consumers and monitor the overpricing in our area.  We plan to collect in groups in the morning to check the distribution pattern as milk lays on the streets and chances are adulteration starts from here.  We will also inform buyers to pay only MRP and there are no refrigeration or transportation charges. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Housing society can end deal with slack builder: Bombay high court  MUMBAI: A housing society can terminate a development agreement with a builder for non-performance, the Bombay high court has said. 
According to Justice RD Dhanuka’s ruling last month, if Jal Ratan Deep Co-operative housing society in Bangur Nagar, Goregaon (West) has lost confidence in Kumar Builders Mumbai Realty, it cannot be forced to continue the contract. 
The court allowed the society to appoint another builder to redevelop its five buildings for 97 members.  “(Since) the buildings are dilapidated, it would be in the interest of justice that before any untoward incident takes place, the petitioner (society) be permitted to take steps to appoint another developer and go ahead with the redevelopment,” said the judge. 
In February 2010, the society passed a resolution at its special general body meeting to appoint a developer.  An agreement was signed with Kumar Builders in January 2011 for redevelopment.  The developer was required to obtain preliminary permissions to start construction within three months from the execution of the agreement, furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 18 crore, indemnity bond and payment of hardship compensation, etc.  The agreement stipulated that the developer complete the project within 29 months. 
When the builder delayed procuring permissions, the society granted an extension of 16 months.  No headway was made when the extension expired in September 2011.  Five months later, the developer told the society he would offer less area to the members in the new building on the pretext that the development control rule had been amended. 
The society told the court that the builder procured the basic building permission (IOD) in March 2013, a full 26 months after the agreement.  “The IOD was defective as it covered only flats for 56 members and not 97 members.  The IOD was in the name of Kumar Urban Development and not in the society’s name,’’ said the petitioner. 
The builder then served a notice on the society, asking its members to vacate their flats by end-December 2013, “completely ignoring the conditions of the development agreement”.  The builder’s representative also told society members about its financial problems, stating it would lose Rs 16 crore if more area was offered in the redeveloped property as promised in the agreement. 
In the general body meeting of November 14, 2014, society members unanimously agreed to invoke a clause in the development agreement to impose liquidated damages of Rs 18.8 crore on the builder.  They also recorded their dissatisfaction and hardship due to the delay. 
Last December, the society issued a notice on the builder, asking it to rectify the breaches within 30 days or risk cancellation of the deal.  The developer filed for arbitration.  The court appointed an arbitrator, and said the society must issue a 15-day notice to the builder if it decides to appoint another developer. 
“A perusal of the record prima-facie indicates the respondent (builder) committed various breaches and gross delay.  Though letter of intent was issued by the society to the builder in May 2010, no steps were taken by the builder to get flats vacated till the agreement was terminated,’’ said the court. 
However, the judge said the builder would be entitled to compensation in case it succeeds in the arbitration proceedings.

The fewest (581) were in the ‘VVIP’ D ward, which includes Malabar Hill, Pedder Road and Kotachiwadi, and is where the chief minister, governor and municipal commissioner reside.  Activists have questioned the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s “preferential treatment” to some localities during its drive to keep the city’s stray canine population in check. 
Activist Chetan Kothari had sought ward-wise details about strays and dog bite cases since 2004, through an RTI query. 
The reply stated that between January 2004 and March 2015, Mumbai recorded 7.5 lakh dog bites and 50 deaths due to rabies.  Since 2004, the most people to have died due to rabies is 13 in 2005.  This year, till March, one person has died. 
P-North ward is closely followed by K-East ward, with 5,540 dogs.  The ward includes Saki Naka, Sahar, Jogeshwari and MIDC. 
South Mumbai, in comparison, has less than half the number strays than those found in the suburbs.  D ward, which has the fewest strays, is followed by C ward, which includes Marine Drive, Kalbadevi and Zaveri Bazar, at 669. 
Indrani Malkani, trustee of the citizens’ group Together VCAN and resident of Little Gibbs Road in D ward, said that there are bins all over the ward.  “It has nothing to do being a VVIP ward, but it’s the concerted efforts of the civic authorities and the residents’ positive involvement. ”
Kothari said another reason for more strays in the suburbs could be large slum pockets.  “Stray dogs eat whatever is available.  Several slum pockets overflow with garbage, which attracts them.  At D ward, there’s regular cleaning, more so because the rich and influential have their homes there. ”
Activist Shyama Kulkarni, an AGNI (Action for good Governance and Networking in India) trustee, said, “I am shocked that there are very few stray dogs in areas such as D ward.  Does it mean they are being picked up? Such a vast difference in numbers is surprising.  There has got to be something beyond sterilization or cleanliness here. ”
Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer, BMC, said they were doing their job in all areas. 
“From our side, we pick up dogs for sterilization and after that they are left in the same area.  As far as the difference in numbers is concerned I would need to check about it,” she said.

In the city, he stayed with Cecilia and his sister Jenny at a rented flat in Evershine Nagar.  Jenny is a cabin crew member with a leading private airline.  Ronald and Jenny lost their father to an ailment a year ago. On Tuesday, Ronald and Cecelia went to Vasai where they own some property.  On their return to Malad, Ronald stepped out to meet a friend.  Around 8.30pm, he got a call from his mother asking what time he would be home.  She mentioned that she was out for a stroll.  Ronald dropped his friend and reached home around 9pm.  The assailants were waiting inside. “Ronald was stabbed thrice in his chest and thrice on his leg.  There were abrasions on his arm,” said a police official.  The watchman of the society saw the assailants come around 8.30pm and leave an hour later.  “They said they were going to flat 202 (where the D’Souzas lived) and were acquainted with the occupants.  I did not suspect anything amiss,” watchman Laltap Singh said.  At 10.15pm, Cecelia came home.  “Ronald wasn’t answering the door, so Cecelia opened it with her set of keys.  She found him sprawled on the bedroom floor in a pool of blood.  She rushed out and rang my doorbell,” said next door neighbour and their landlord’s daughter-in-law Shilpa Pai.  “I thought Ronald had been assaulted and offered to call the doctor.  But Cecilia told me he had been murdered.  I forbade her from going back into the house and informed my in-laws.  We dialled the cops who arrived in five minutes,” Pai said. Besides charges of robbery and murder, in the FIR the police have also applied section 202 of IPC (intentional omission to give information of offence to police by a person bound to inform).  The watchman of the society has given a description of the attackers to the cops and said he can identify them.  The police have already run some of the family’s acquaintances past him. The D’Souzas own a flat in another society, which is being redeveloped.  They have been Pai’s tenants for the past two years.  “Cecelia was not comfortable living alone when her kids were away on work.  Post-6pm, she would head to her friend’s place to spend the night,” said Pai.  “Ronald was sociable and his friends would visit him frequently whenever he came home,” she added.  Jenny, flying when the killing took place, rushed back on learning of the murder.  Ronald’s funeral will take place on Thursday evening. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Woman held for son’s murder; hunt on for 2 more he Malad police on Friday arrested Cecelia D’souza (54) in connection with the murder of her son Ronald (31), who was stabbed to death in his Malad residence on Tuesday night. 
The police said that Ronald objected to her illicit affair with her former driver leading to the hatching of the murder plot. 
On Tuesday, Cecelia had called the police and told her she had returned home after her evening walk to find Ronald lying in a pool of blood in their second floor residence in Tai Mansion building in Malad. 
Post-mortem examination later revealed that he had been stabbed multiple times in the chest. 
His cell phone and gold chain were missing from the house, and the police had at the time registered a complaint of murder and robbery against unknown persons. 
“We examined Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of cameras outside the building, and saw Cecelia standing outside the building during the time she claimed to have gone for a walk.  This discrepancy first pointed the needle of suspicion at her.  We then conducted some further inquiries, including checking her cell phone location.  We found out about her relationship with Ronald, after which we picked her up for questioning,” said an officer with the Bangur Nagar police. 
According to officials, after sustained questioning Cecelia broke down and confessed to have planned the murder. 
In her confession, she reportedly told the police that she had an affair with a 25-year-old man for over a year and a half.  Her husband had passed away a year ago, after which her paramour started visiting the D’souza residence frequently. 
This angered Ronald and was the cause of frequent fights between mother and son, and Cecelia allegedly decided to find a permanent solution to the problem, the police said. 
“On Tuesday evening, Cecelia stepped out saying she was going for a walk while Ronald was sleeping in the house.  Her paramour, along with a friend of his met her near the building, went to her house and killed Ronald.  We are still piecing together the exact sequence of events,” the officer said. 
Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Deshmane, Zone XI added, “Cecelia has been remanded to police custody till December 17.  Efforts are underway to trace and apprehend Cecelia’s paramour and his friend. ”

Shyamtarai,"Dhamtari villagers grapple with monkey menace After leopards, now even monkeys have began to torment human beings residing in the villages of Sorid, Jalampr, Dani Tola, Batena, and Shanti Colony.  According to the villagers, a band of around 50 to 100 monkeys have entered into the villages hooting, jumping and destroying their crops and households. 
However, as usual, the forest officials have turned a deaf ear to the repeated complaints of the villagers about the monkey menace and asked them to cope up with the animals and wait for the monsoon to arrive so that the monkeys retire to the jungles. 
According to sources, soaring temperature and scarcity of water in the jungles have forced these animals to move into the human habitats.  Even as the pack of monkeys continues to attack the fields and feed on vegetables and fruits, the farmers are left to deal with them in their own ways. 
Rajuram Sahu, a resident of Shyamtarai village said, “Earlier also monkeys used to enter into villages during summer but were not as danger as today. ” The roof tiles of his house have been damaged by these animals, he added. 
Renuka Dewangan of Panchvati colony said that the monkeys have started creating problem for the residents.  They take away the cloths and destroy other eatables kept outside.

Pallithottam,"Renovated Kollam canal now a cesspool More than Rs.13 crore spent on renovating and reviving the Kollam Canal seems to have gone down the drain. 
The renovation work began in 2010 as part of an ambitious project to form part of the 78-km Kollam-Kovalam State Waterway, which has tremendous tourism potential. 
But even after five years, the work on the canal has not shown much progress. 
Except for the fact that about 950 houses on the banks of the canal were cleared and its inhabitants rehabilitated elsewhere under the Tsunami Rehabilitation Project, the canal does not reveal any remote sign of being revived. 
Renovation work
The renovation work had envisaged fencing and beautifying the banks, dredging of the canal from the Ashtamudi Lake to Pallithottam, and erection of side protection works from Ashtamudi Lake to Mundakkal. 
Dredging was carried out with interest but it turned out the work was a way to loot construction grade sand from the canal bed. 
While the people of Kollam city expected the canal to turn beautiful through the revival project, it has now become a health hazard with enormous mass of garbage being dumped into it from various locations. 
With the banks cleared of encroachments, garbage from various locations of the city is now being furiously dumped into the canal. 
The Inland Navigation Department, having jurisdiction over the canal, actively supervised the dredging programme but it now appears to have discarded the canal. 
During the past, the canal had served as one of the main trade channels in the Travancore part of the State. 
Transport
Huge freight houseboats ferrying various types of goods through the canal were a common sight those days. 
In Kollam, the Chamakada course of the canal served as a harbour for unloading the goods brought by these vessels to Kollam. 
It was also used for loading processed cashew from factories for export and other goods sold from the wholesale markets of Kollam. 
Encroachment
With the development of rail and road transport network, the canal became defunct and its banks were encroached upon. 
Dumping ground
Over the years, it became a dumping ground for garbage, hospital and abattoir waste, and even sewage. 
The canal now remains choked, and the much publicised revival project has done nothing to change its state.  Kerosene quota being denied: fish workers Fish workers here are planning to intensify agitation for their subsidised quota of kerosene for fishing vessels. 
This month, they say, they were totally dependent on black market kerosene for their livelihood.  The quantity offered through the quota is 129 litres a month at Rs.15.80 a litre.  But the quota for this month has not been released, forcing them to purchase kerosene from the black market at Rs.80 a litre. 
H.  Basilal, Kollam district president of the CITU-affiliated Matsya Thozhilali Union, said denial of kerosene quota was driving the traditional fishing sector to a crisis.  When the traditional fishing sector got motorised in the early 1980s, the monthly kerosene quota for each vessel was 600 litres.  Later, the quota was slashed to 450 litres, then to 350 litres, and now to 129 litres. 
Mr.  Basilal said the present quota did not meet even one-third of the fish workers’ monthly fuel requirement.  They were forced to depend on black marketeers for the rest.  Black marketeers were operating in all fishing villages.  The Kollam city fishing sector, from Pallithottam to Tangasseri, had 786 traditional crafts eligible for the subsidised quota.  This month’s quota had not been released, he said. 
The fact remained that there was no kerosene quota as such from the Centre for the fishing sector.  The quota they got was kerosene for domestic purpose diverted by the State government to the sector, he said.  Based on a report that almost all houses in the State, including those in the sector, had been electrified, the domestic quota was drastically slashed, he said. 
Quota for this month not yet released
Fish workers dependent on black market One held on charges of peddling drugs One person was arrested by the Chavara police on Wednesday from the defunct Premo Pipe Factory complex for allegedly carrying 150 packets of ganja.  The accused has been identified as Shahnavas alias Thalavan, 33, a resident of Mukkuthodu Lakshamveedu colony in Chavara. 
Sub-Inspector G.  Gopakumar who made the arrested said that Shahnavas, a long-time ganja peddler, was also involved in several motorcycle theft cases.  The packets contained 4 grams to 7 grams of ganja each which he sold for rates ranging from Rs.100 to Rs.200 a packet depending upon the financial capacity of his clients. 
Most of his clients were college students in Karunagapally, Kollam and Chavara areas and also some workers attached to the Neendakara fishing harbour.  The Karunagapally assistant commissioner of police, K. R.  Sivasudhan Pillai, recently got a tip-off about the peddler’s activities and followed it up through the Chavara police. 
Circle Inspector Binu Sreedhar said that 720 grams of ganja were seized from Shanavas at the time of his arrest.  He said that Shanavas was involved in about 40 motorcycle theft cases registered by the Kollam East, Chavara, Karunagapally and Kayamkulam police stations.  He is also an accused in five narcotic cases registered by the Excise Department.  Shanavas was produced before a magistrate court at Chavara and remanded to the district jail here.  Meanwhile, the Kollam West police arrested a 38-year-old man from the Thirumullavaram beach on Wednesday on charges of peddling ganja.  He was identified as Padmachandran alias Pappan, residing at Thirumullavaram.  He was arrested by Sub-Inspector N.  Girish on the basis of a tip-off received by City Police Commissioner P.  Prakash. 
A man was arrested by the Pallithottam police following the seizure of a large quantity of banner tobacco products from him on Wednesday.

Alembic Ground,"Irfan, Munaf ignored for Baroda Ranji team  VADODARA: It seems to be the end of the road for Baroda cricketers Irfan Pathan and Munaf Patel this Ranji season.  The duo has again been left out of Baroda's next Ranji game against Madhya Pradesh that will be played in the city.  Once considered to be the backbone of Baroda team, both Irfan and Munaf failed to impress the Ranji selectors during a practice organized recently at Alembic Ground.  While Irfan played his last one day international (ODI) in 2012, Munaf played his last ODI in 2011.  Irfan has been playing in the Baroda Ranji squad but he has been in and out of the team for last couple of seasons due to injuries.  This season too he and Munaf opted out of the first two Ranji games due to injury.  Irfan did show readiness to play for the next two games but he wasn't picked up.  "" Both of them were not up to the mark in the practice game kept for testing their fitness and bowling.  So it was decided to not pick them up for the next Ranji tie.

Ammasa Colony,"Pregnant woman dies of H1N1 in Puducherry  VILLUPURAM: A pregnant woman from Villupuram in Tamil Nadu died of H1N1 on Friday at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, taking the number of flu-related deaths in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to 11 this year. 
M Gowri, 36, who approached the gynecology out-patient ward in Jipmer complaining of breathlessness, was referred to the H1N1 isolation ward for treatment on February 18.  She tested positive for H1N1 on Friday and died later in the day, said Jipmer medical superintendent J Balachander.  This is the second H1N1 death in Jipmer. 
Balachander said a real time PCR test to confirm H1N1 infection takes 24 hours.  “We get samples from different hospitals and patients approach Jipmer for treatment.  With one or two incidents of death, we cannot conclude at this stage that H1N1 cases are on the rise.  Largely, the incidence is more during winter.  As the temperature rises, the number of cases will come down,” he said. 
13 people, including doctor test positive of virus
One more person from Puducherry tested positive for H1N1 on Friday.  I Umavathi, 52, from Nainarmandapam in the town limits, who was admitted to Jipmer, after she complained of throat pain, rashes and fever. 
A two-year-old girl M Thejesri from Pillaithottam was admitted to Jipmer on February 16 with fever and frequent bouts of coughing.  Her throat swab, which was sent for medical examination, returned positive on Friday. 
So far 13 people, including a doctor from Jipmer and his wife, tested positive for H1N1 this year in the Union territory.  One patient D Gomathi, 31 from Manamedu in Bahour in the outskirts of the town died on February 8. 
Ten patients, who recovered after undergoing treatment at Jipmer, were discharged.  Two patients were undergoing treatment at Jipmer, said deputy director (public health) of the directorate of health and family welfare services T Kumaravel. 
In Puducherry H1N1 cases have been reported in Vidhuthalai Nagar in Mudhaliarpet, Solai Nagar in Muthialpet, Jipmer quarters and Indira Nagar in Gorimedu, SMV Puram in Villianur, Nainarmandapam, Pillaithottam, Thattanchavady, Annai Teresa Nagar and Veema Nagar and Ammasa Colony in Karaikal. 
Health officials said the directorate sends medical teams to localities, where positive cases were reported, to administer Tamiflu to family members and neighbours, who might have come into contact with them as a precautionary measure to prevent spread of the respiratory disease in the territory. 
Jipmer which has the required laboratory facilities to test H1N1 cases has established an isolation ward to treat patients.  Puducherry government too has set up an isolation ward at the TB Sanatorium.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Ansupa lake,"Wildlife Week: Save biodiversity, save world As per legal definition, wildlife includes any animal specified in Schedules I -IV and found in the wild.  This is clarified in Wildlife Protection Act 1972.  Almost all the animals of Indian soil are included in this definition.  Practically, there is no Vermin in the nature which becomes a nuisance. From October 2 to 8 every calendar year is observed the Wildlife Week in India.  It begins with the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 
Similarly October 4 is observed as World Animal Day to create awareness on preservation and conservation of animals.  So every individual should take the responsibility of protecting the wild animals.  Gandhi himself had told that every human being should be compassionate towards the animals. 
There are 15 geographical divisions where different races of animals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, rodents, carnivores, herbivores, omnivores and insectivores etc.  are found due to variable habitats and  habits.  (1) Tropical wet evergreen.  The plant and animal diversifications here are very rich.  (2) Tropical semi evergreen forest, where the crop composition is evergreen to semi evergreen in nature.  The diversification of animal and plant is as good as tropical wet evergreen forest.  (3) Tropical moist deciduous (Sal) forest.  Sal itself is a semi- evergreen plant and its associate plants are also deciduous and semi deciduous.  The soil profile is also very rich. 
Similarly, the biodiversity of the region is also equally rich like wet evergreen, and semi evergreen forests.  (4) Tropical moist deciduous forests with or without Sal trees.  The deciduous trees mean the trees that remain leafless for conservation of moisture in the plant bodies.  (5) Tropical dry deciduas forests.  In such forests the trees are completely deciduous and the soil is dry.  So the ground flora is not as rich as other four categories of forests.  (6) Tropical dry evergreen forests.  Such types of forests are found in semi hilly areas where the soil is not so rich as compared to other five types of forests.   Such types of forest are definitely better than dry deciduous forests and the plant and animal compositions are better than dry deciduous forest.  (7) Sub- tropical wet forests. 
The type of forest is a better habitat of plants and animals.  The forests are also found in Odisha.  (8) Sub- tropical dry forests.  The crop and animal composition are not rich like other types of forests.  (9) Tropical thorn forests.  (10) Sub – tropical pine forests.  (11) Wet temperate forests.  (12) Moist temperate forest.  (13) Dry temperate forests.  (14) Alpine forests.  Alpine forests are not found in Odisha.  So the wild lives of these bio- climatic zones are quite different than tropical zones.  The temperate and alpine zones have poorer bio- diversities compared to the tropical zone.  (15) The tidal forests of river mouths are extremely rich in biodiversities.  The river mouth forests or the tidal eco- systems are seen only in tropical lands.  So the most richly diversified ecosystems in respect of plants and animals are seen in tidal eco- systems. 
Other than 15 distinctive biological systems, there are coastal and peninsular eco systems.  As Odisha is a State of rivers, streams and ocean, they influence the climate of Odisha.  So the peninsular cum riverine ecological systems are prominent in the State.  Especially, different kinds of mammals of herbivores and carnivores are noticed in the regions. 
There are a large number of plant and animal communities in the ocean itself and also in the trans– zones of land and ocean.  These are mostly polluted and decayed due to pollution of river systems in Odisha.  A large part of plants and animals are noticed within the shallow parts of the sea than the deep sea.  Sadly, all the oceans in the globe are becoming mega garbage bins of human beings.  So the flora and fauna including the avifauna are under threat. 
The main peninsular wetlands of Odisha include Chilika lagoon, Bhitarkanika, Hadagarh, lakhari valley, Ansupa lake, Satkoshia, Chandaka – Damapada.  Among the peninsular hubs, the Chillika lagoon and the Ansupa lake are major eco- diversified spots.  These areas are very eco- sensitive which need preventive, protective and conservative measures under the principle of sustainable development. 
The large scale cultivation of prawn within the lagoon lands of Chillika is a threat to its very existence, which should be restrained very soon.  The Environment Protection Act 1986 and the Biological Diversity Act 2002 should be enforced strictly as curative measures in case of Chillika and Ansupa.  The Ansupa lake is shrinking very fast due to siltation and grabbing of lands for cultivations. 
The original shape of the lake is much reduced for improper management of the lake by the authorities.  So the sustainability of the lake is at stake. Indiscriminate waste disposal by the residents, industries and civic agencies have become a cause of concern for sustainable maintenance of river systems. 
All the Hindu festivals generally fall during winter months of the year.  The winter months are also the period of harvesting of different agricultural crops.  This is also the period of breading season of different birds, animals, amphibians and reptiles.  The idols of gods and goddess are immersed in the water bodies as a custom which pollute the water systems and water sources and pose a threat to the their ecosystems.

Canoly Canal,"New schemes to boost growth prospects : The comprehensive master plan for Kozhikode urban area is expected to give an impetus to the felt-needs such as transportation and the tourism sector. 
Besides, the adjoining grama panchayats of Olavanna, Feroke , Kadalundi and Ramanattukara, which have been added to Kozhikode city, will get more recognition with their rapid urbanisation.  Recently the State government decided to de-link the erstwhile Cheruvannur- Nallalam, Beypore and Elathur grama panchayats, which had been merged with the Corporation before the 2010 polls, to form three separate municipalities.  Even though the de-linking of the three sectors has become a political debate and now legally fought in the High Court of Kerala, the evolving urban characteristics of Cheruvannur-Nallalam, Beypore and Elathur remains unquestionable.  Further, the government has also decided to upgrade Feroke to a municipality. 
Thus the master plan, which has been approved by the joint planning committee, is now being sent to the Chief Town Planner for approval.  It has been prepared with a focus on the growth prospects of the city in the next 20 years, said K. V.  Abdul Malik, Regional Town Planner. 
The master plan has proposed to convert the existing market at Palayam into an indoor complex and develop a commercial complex at Valiyangadi (Big Bazaar) and establish an international convention centre on the premises of Kerala Soaps Ltd.  Another is rehabilitating the colonies at Nadakkavu, Kalluthankkadavu and EMS Stadium.  Focus has also been given to develop the large swathe of marshy lands lying in between Malapparamba-Paroppady and Kannadikkal into a fresh water lake.  The historic Sweet Meat (S. M. ) Street, Tali, Kuttichira, Thiruvannur, Bilathikulam, Thamarakkulam and Mananchira will be transformed into heritage centres.  The master plan also wanted the commercial S. M.  Street, Customs Road, Palayam- Tali and Moideen Palli Road free of vehicles.  A heritage walk has been planned between Varakkal temple to Canoly Canal.  An eco-tourism village at Kadalundi, waterfront tourism at Elathur, water cruise through Canoli Canal and creation of waterway network in the city are new schemes.  Another proposal is inland water transport for passengers and freight traffic from Elathur to Kadalundi using Elathur-Kallayi and Beypore-Kallayi canals and a connection to the mobility hub at Malaparamba. 
Model fishing villages have been envisaged at Mukhadhar, Puthiyappa and Chaliyam.  Other proposals are a swimming pool at Eranikkal, night shelter near Railway Station Link Road and a dry dock on the Beypore port premises.  Invasive weeds block flow of water in Canoly canal : With the delay in undertaking a government-funded cleaning drive, infectious weeds, including the swiftly multiplying African Moss, have begun to stall water flow in the city’s old Canoly Canal.  Around 5-km stretch of the canal on the Elathur side is now fully covered with African moss, where the flow of the water has almost stopped. 
Residents living close to the canal say the decayed waste dumped in various points of the canal have started emanating foul smell, which will increase in the days to come with the delay in undertaking a cleaning drive.  The flow of water from the Korappuzha estuary to the canal is declining day by day, which will worsen with the strengthening of the summer season, they point out. 
Residents allege that the funds so far spent for the cause are yet to show a visible growth though there has been a series of development programmes for Canoly canal to make it an attractive waterway.  As per official records, the district administration spent around Rs.7.5 crore between 1997 to 2010 on various schemes to de-silt the canal, but, the area still remains contaminated with degradable and non-degradable waste.  Though cleaning work costing Rs.  2.42 crore was carried out very recently, it also proved futile with the swiftly growing weeds inside the 11.4 km canal. 
Sajith Kumar, a resident of Elathur, points out that the canal is now nowhere in the radar of the much glorified development proposals.  Construction of paved footpath, seating arrangement along canal banks and gardens were some of the declared projects, but, nothing has been done so far.  He also points out that the canal, which was used as a popular inland waterway till 1950s, is hardly suitable for such a purpose now with the poor maintenance and apathy to carry out development projects in a time-bound manner.

Hatibagan,"Hawkers use rain excuse to grab more space  KOLKATA: With less than a month to go for Chaitra Sale, hawkers at Gariahat are extending their footprint on the pavements â in the garb of reinforcing the stall against rain â to woo more customers. 
Dismantling the existing bamboo structures and plastic sheets that âhave become weak and frayed with exposure to elementsâ, stall owners have pooled in resources to rebuild the stalls.  In doing so, most of them have grabbed a few extra feet, encroaching further on the already depleted pavements. 
âEach stall has paid Rs 500 for the reinforcement ahead of the rains.  While monsoon is some time away, unseasonal showers in March-April can wreak havoc as we take loans to stock up for brisk sales during the Bengali New Year.  Goods will get damaged if they get wet.  That can be devastating for stall-owners,â said Pratima Das, a hawker. 
Her fortified stall now encroaches on a buildingâs entrance, a small inconvenience that offices and businesses located in it must bear for âgreater goodâ, she explained. 
While this line of stalls has occupied half the pavement, up from the one-third compromise formula that heavyweight hawker union leader Shaktiman Ghosh had drawn up some years ago to allow room for pedestrians, the shades occupy more than three-fourth of the pavementâs width. 
Ghosh admitted that a large section of hawkers was flouting rules.  âWe donât support encroachment of pavements and want hawkers to coexist with citizens,â he said. 
Towards the Gariahat intersection, the entire skyline is covered by plastic sheets.  These stalls have not extended their wares but set up stools for customers to settle and check out saris and dresses. 
Biplab Chakraborty, who has also reinforced his stall, admitted that the plastic cover obscures the pavement from the road, block shop hoardings and are both an eyesore and a safety hazard. 
âWe are aware that if there is a fire, entire Gariahat will be up in flames due to the sea of plastic sheets.  But we have no option since the government has not done anything constructive,â said Chakraborty. 
He had a solution to offer.  âKMC can tie up with firms and set up semi-permanent steel structures on the footpath, a couple of feet away from the kerb so that those pedestrians who want to avoid hawkers can walk without impediment.  Towards the pavement, the stall can occupy five-seven feet while the fiber glass shade can extend a couple of feet more.  The rear of the stall can be used as an advertising board facing the road to garner revenue,â he suggested. 
Ghosh, the leader of the Hawker Sangram Committee, said the proposal was worth pondering over and even trying out on a pilot basis in congested belts like Gariahat and Hatibagan.

As counting came to a close on Tuesday evening, the verdict was out.  The 'telebhajawala' had beaten the doctor by a handsome margin of 1,633 votes in ward 17. 
Another twist, an interest one, in the story is that both have close ties with Trinamool Congress.  While Mohun Gupta, who owns a 'telebhaja' shop in Hatibagan area, defected from Trinamool recently and fought as an independent candidate, his competitor Partha Pratim Hazari was a mayor-in-council member. 
Now that Gupta is happy that he has been able to prove a point, he now wishes to go back to his family business, manning the counter of Lakshi Narayan Shaw & Brothers, his ‘telebhaja’ shop.  The shop was started by Gupta's father Lakshi Narayan Shaw 96 years ago.  It was he who started distributing free snacks to people on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birthday on January 23 every year since Netaji was one of the most valued customers of the shop during the Raj era. 
Shaw passed on the business to Mohun and his elder brother Kisto Kumar Gupta in 2000.  Unlike Kisto, Mohun was nurturing a dream of becoming a leader and concentrated on social work in areas of Bidhan Sarani, Grey Street, Chittaranjan Avenue and Beadon Street.  His work soon caught attention of Mamata Banerjee and Mohun alias Mana was taken in Trinamool Congress as a worker in north Kolkata.  Mana rose to prominence when his service to the people of ward 17 was recognized by Sashi Panja, a former MMiC and now a state minister. 
However, the rise brought with it intra-party rivalry with Hazari becoming the most vocal critic.  The political ‘enemity’ took an ugly turn when Hazari reportedly ensured that Mana was not granted a ticket for the KMC elections this time.  Mana decided to fight the civic polls as an independent, banking on his social works. 
According to Ratan Jain, Gupta’s campaign manager, Mana could win the polls as he was firmly grounded as a social worker and stood by the needs of the people.  Nirangshu Pal, son of legendary footballer Gosto Pal, said Mana was ahead of Hazari as a human being who takes his social work seriously.  “Mana may not be as qualified as Hazari.  But then he is sincere and committed to the cause of common people,” Pal said. 
Mana himself felt that now the war was won, he would go back to his party of choice.  “I was always mentally associated with Trinamool Congress.  Now if my party asks me to go back to its fold, I won’t think twice,” Gupta said.  Once termed as a ‘rebel’ Trinamool Congress leader, Gupta said his fight was with an individual and not with the party.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  KMC to offer free pathology tests  KOLKATA: Come October, citizens will have the option to get pathological tests done for free. 
All that they have to do is visit one of the malaria clinics run by the health department of Kolkata Municipal Corporation and get examined by a medical official there.  The medical officer will recommend the tests and the patients can give their blood for analysis there.  The samples will be sent to a dengue detection centre for the pathological exams but the patients can collect the reports from the malaria clinic. 
The free tests include serum cholesterol, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, SGPT and some routine tests such as stool and urine.  The pathological tests will be done at five of the civic dengue detection centres that the KMC health department has decided to upgrade for such examinations. 
Funds had been sanctioned for the upgrade of five dengue centres into full-fledged labs, confirmed Atin Ghosh, member, mayor-in-council, who oversees the KMC health department.  âOur lab technicians at the dengue centres analyze blood samples for malaria and dengue.  For the new facility, these technicians from five of those centres have been trained to carry out the other tests offered by the health department,â Ghosh said on Saturday.  The five centres where the tests will be done are at Hatibagan, Haji Mohammed Mohsin square, Chetla, Layalka and Behala.  Ghosh said based on citizensâ response, the civic body would open more such labs in the next two years.  âInitially, we are introducing the facility based on the staff strength at five dengue detection labs.  We need to open more such labs once people start taking these tests,â he said, adding a drive was on to recruit more doctors to fill vacancies in some of the malaria clinics. 
The KMC also plans to introduce blood tests for diabetes.  âWe want to extend this crucial facility to citizens.  We have trained our doctors.  Diabetes expert T K Mukherjee, who is also an advisor to the KMC health department, may contribute to make the project a success,â a KMC health official said.

Kolkata: Woman loses hand, glare on cop delay  KOLKATA: The right hand of a 36-year-old woman was severed as she fell off a bus while alighting at a wrong spot and the vehicle, racing with another one, ran over her hand on Wednesday.  The doctors at Calcutta Medical College could have conducted a reattachment surgery and stitched the hand back, but the police—apparently unable to find the right person with whom they could have left the severed limb at the hospital—took it back with them and sent it to the morgue on Central Avenue.  Now, Sita Rauth has lost her right hand forever. 
The incident took place on Wednesday when Sita Rauth boarded the bus (route 240) at Hatibagan to reach a beauty salon office on Vivekananda Road where she works.  Around 11.50am, the bus stopped at a red signal at the Kailash Bose Street crossing and Rauth reportedly made to alight from the vehicle, even though it was not a designated bus stop.  The signal suddenly turned green, and with another bus on the same route following it, the driver started the bus with a jolt.  As Rauth stumbled down, the bus ran over her right hand, severing it, the police said.  The bus was not only racing with another one but also rushing to avoid an SUCI rally approaching the route. 
Raut lay on the road, writhing in pain for a while, before personnel from the Girish Park police station could reach the spot.  While the police transported Raut to Calcutta Medical College, they reportedly got stuck in the SUCI rally.  The police finally managed to get Raut to the hospital at 12.30pm. 
Immediately, doctors at the emergency started working on minimizing the profuse bleeding and trauma management, the only way they could have saved Raut.  Around 3.30pm, when Raut’s condition was finally stabilized and she could be taken to the operation theatre for the reattachment surgery, the doctors reportedly could not find the severed hand.  According to a source, no one was even sure if the police had at all picked up the severed hand from the road.  But the police claimed they brought it to the hospital in a plastic packet and shown it to doctors.  When they apparently did not get any response from doctors if the limb could be reattached, they took it back with them to the police station.  When the police finally located the limb to the morgue, a lot of time had been lost. 
“We looked everywhere for the detached limb.  We went to the emergency, to the orthopaedic ward and even to the police outpost near the emergency ward to check if the limb had been left somewhere, but found it nowhere.  The police should have submitted it to us, when they brought the patient in.  With today’s advanced technology, we can reattach severed limbs if we attend to the patient within six hours of an accident.  Now it’s too late,” said Dr Shekhar Chowdhury, attending Raut. 
Doctors subsequently conducted a micro-vascular surgery without the limb to curb further damage to the tissues, and Raut was wheeled out of the operation theater by 5.45pm.

Realty booms, so do syndicates  KOLKATA: A suburban civic body that barely existed 20 years ago, now boasts of apartment towers sprouting as concrete weeds, more than 20 markets, a sprawling mall at its doorsteps, five multinational fast food outlets and upscale showrooms selling from fragrances to fast cars. 
But amidst the blinding brightness of the swank outlets and highrises, there exists a dark and assertive suburban underbelly waiting restlessly to cash in on the rapid urbanisation threatening an urban-subaltern clash. 
Welcome to R…Gopalpur.  No, this is not a sequel to Shahid Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha starrer R…Rajkumar, but the Rajarhat Gopalpur civic body has gained the moniker among the local politicians and administration for convenience. 
Situated around 15 kilometres from the city, Rajarhat Gopalpur is also known as the hot hub of syndicate and land mafia.  It triggered curiosity after its merger with Salt Lake to form the Salt Lake Municipal Corporation that will vote on October 3. 
“These elements which are associated with syndicates and land mafia will get a free run.  The goons associated with Trinamool will take over the entire area,” said former CPM MLA Robin Mondal who withdrew his candidature a few days ago.  He was coincidently blamed for heading the syndicates during the erstwhile Left regime. 
With a population of almost 4.25 lakh in its 30 wards, Rajarhat Gopalpur is bigger than Salt Lake.  It includes vast swathes of Baguiati, VIP Road, Chinar Park, Rajarhat Main Road and Tegharia. 
Though the municipality has been a Left fief since its inception, TMC wields the clout here.  Dampy Mondal, a candidate, is considered to be a vital associate of New Town MLA Sabyasachi Dutta. 
Land prices skyrocketed in this area in the late 90s when Hidco started acquiring land to build a township on the eastern fringes of Kolkata.  Unlike Salt Lake where the land is leasehold, the plots in Rajarhat Gopalpur are freehold which makes it far easier and profitable for the land mafia.  “These people have now exhausted their money and are eyeing to cash in on the impending urbanisation in the area,” said a former councillor of the municipality who is re-contesting. 
There was a flush of cash in the area when many people utilised the opportunity and sold off their land for high prices. 
A cross section of people TOI spoke to came up with various ideas of cashing in on the urbanisation with the potential of scaring anybody planning to move in one of the swank apartments being build here.  “There will be a huge demand for auto-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws.  We can swamp the area with them,” said Shahnawaz Biswas, who is associated with a “cooperative” that supplies construction materials to a residential project in the area. 
A sizeable population that makes up the municipality consists of two types of people.  One that moved in here from rented accommodations in the city and the other section is that moved in from far flung areas of North 24-Parganas and Nadia to stay closer to Kolkata where they work.  There is yet a third section that is waiting to pounce on the “plethora of opportunities” that is a bigger threat.  Tapan mondal, a TMC supporter, is planning to supply private security guards and domestic help in the households. 
“This also indicates a trend of the subaltern trying to occupy space with the urban and trying to play catch up.  The fear is that instead of eliminating the socio economical contrast this may give rise to conflicts within the two sections,” said a political scientist. 
Many people are planning to block the roads for traffic and turn them into a bazar in the morning and put up food stalls in the evening.  “See the beautiful arrangement in Hatibagan and Gariahat.  We will replicate it here,” said Ananda Dali, who is currently employed and devoting his time to campaign for a Trinamool candidate. 
The inconsistency in the nature of landholding in Salt Lake and the parts of the corporation is another dichotomy.  In Rajarhat Gopalpur, the owner of a piece of land can sell off their land without paying any mandatory fees to the government as the land is freehold but in Salt Lake the owners of a plot has to pay Rs 5 lakhs to the government if they want to their leasehold right. 
The political parties are already feeling the pressure of not ensuring employment opportunities in the state.  Young supporters are flocking to the ruling party as it is in power but they want their pound of flesh in return.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Civic body caught in land grab row  JIAGANJ: The construction work for a community toilet in Jiaganj-Ajimganj municipality has run into troubled waters with allegations of land grab.  The Left Front-run municipality’s chairman Shankar Mondal, who is supervising the work, has reportedly allowed a breach in the Hatibagan post office boundary wall to lay the pipeline. 
On Monday, Mondal was seen on the post office premises with labourers to supervise work on connecting the new septic tank with the toilet.  Mondal said, “We have set up six community toilets.  The postmaster has given verbal permission for this. ”
Residents protested against the unethical use of post office land without taking due permissions.  Postmaster Dibyendu Bhattachrya said, “I am helpless as the chairman is influential.  I could not protest as Mondal himself was present at the spot. 
I have told my seniors about it, and will submit a written complaint to the superintendent of posts, Behrampore division, on Tuesday. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Parking plight for disabled devotees  KOLKATA: Almost all leading organizers have made provisions for ramps, wheelchairs and a separate entrance, but with parking restricted around most big pujas, pandal-hopping could turn out be an ordeal for the physically challenged. 
“All big pujas have volunteers to escort the challenged people inside.  But parking restrictions could pose a problem.  They obviously can’t reach out to those who will be forced to get off their vehicles a kilometer away.  This negates the purpose of having facilities inside pandals.  But we must a find an alternative,” said Partho Ghosh, vice-president of the Forum for Durgotsav — an umbrella organization of around 200 puja committees. 
“Ever since the ‘best facilities for challenged people’ award was started, things changed for the better.  Pandals started having ramps, separate entrances and wheelchairs.  Those that couldn’t create a separate entry, threw open their VIP gates.  But there is little that can be done about parking restrictions.  Sadly, despite having adequate facilities, pujas will be out of bounds for the challenged,” said Debajyoti Roy, secretary of Non-discrimination, Integration and Participation (NIP), an NGO. 
Ekdalia Evergreen, one of the most prominent pujas in south Kolkata, is likely to be hit by parking restrictions.  Though parking is allowed at a little distance from the pandal, there isn’t enough space.  “We can’t interfere with parking arrangements since it is entirely up to police to decide.  But it shouldn’t be too difficult for the physically challenged to make it to our pandal on less crowded days,” said Gautam Mukhopadhyay of the puja committee. 
Big pujas in the north could be even worse.  Pandals at Hatibagan have been allotted parking space at Ahiritola, 1.5km away.  Visitors at the College Square pandal have to park at Subodh Mullick Square, 1 km away.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Periyakkatupalayam,"Flood recedes, but their pain lingers Even though floodwater has receded, many families are yet to recover from the extensive damage to their properties by rains and flash floods in Cuddalore district.  Most of the affected persons in Periyakkatupalayam are Dalits comprising 98 families from Arunthathiyar and Adi Dravidar castes.  The villagers mainly depend on the earning from working at cashew groves. 
Periyakkatupalayam is one of the worst-hit villages in the district.  The gushing water of Periyakkattupalayam Odai uprooted the lives of Dalits who have been living here for years together.  All of them have taken shelter in a nearby village. 
Amirtham(80) whose grandsons and daughter altogether eight members of her family were washed by flood and even a couple of relatives who came on a visit lost their lives. 
“I was living in the same place and never seen such floods in my life time.  Now I am in temporary shelter now and don’t know what will happen next,” Amirtham said. 
V. Rasu (40), who is resident of the same place recalled ordeal the villagers undergone on November 9.  He said, “Had the flash flood entered into the village in the night, it would have taken all our lives.  Somehow, we managed to move from here by joining hands together. ”
Some of the villagers are now coming down to their houses and attempting to revive normal lives with whatever they gathered from the ruins. 
Anbalagi (35) said, “After staying in the temporary shelter, we came today to our homes only to find that fans, grinders and other electrical are damaged. 
Some of the clothing materials dumped in soil and retrieved them.  We cleaned the soiled utensils and tried to use them for cooking in the temporary shelter. ”
Too crowded
Some of the villagers who were sheltered in temporary camps at Nadukattupalayam have been complaining that the makeshift shelter is too crowded. 
R. Palani (53) said, “Immediately after the incident, we moved to government school and later moved to another school at Kadampuliyur.  Just five days ago, we were sheltered here at Nadukattupalayam.  The shelter is overcrowded and three or four families were given shelter in an enclosure. ”
The villagers urged the government to expedite the work to identify new site where new houses can be constructed expeditiously. 
The farmers of Kalkunam village alleged that the bund of Sengal Odai which breached only after the public sector undertaking Neyveli Lignite Corporation pumped its surplus water.  Chandrasekar (64) of Kalkunam alleged that only because of the surplus water discharged into the Sengal Odai,the breach occurred in the bund and brought water inside the agricultural fields. 
Paddy lost
“Soil deposits accumulated about a feet above the paddy field and all my seven acres of paddy lost,” he bemoaned. 
However, an official of NLC rubbished these charges.  The official said on November 9, none of the NLC pumps were working and all of them were submerged in the water.  There was no power at all.  “How could we pump the water into the canal where there was no power?” he countered.  Tamil Nadu floods: When their lives were hanging by a branch Broken branches of their cashew tree saved the lives of K.  Balakrishnan and his wife Kalyani when the flood engulfed their village in Tamil Nadu’s Cuddalore district. 
Shivers went down their spines, when water gushed into their thatched hut at Periyakattupalayam, rising menacingly by the minute. 
Periyakkatupalayam was one of the worst-hit villages in the district.  Most of the affected persons were Dalits. 
“The speed and volume of water flow was threatening and it soon began filling the hut.  When we tried to get out, we saw the entire neighbourhood was rapidly getting flooded,” said Balakrishnan, recounting the horror. 
He said the only option for them was to climb the loft. 
“The loft became very shaky.  Hence, my wife and I climbed a litter higher and clung on to the central supporting bamboo of the hut and placed our legs over another bamboo,” he told PTI. 
“Soon, the front legs (bamboos) of the hut caved and we began seriously doubting our chances of survival.  Luckily, when the hut began shaking vigorously, some bamboo poles got stuck in the fallen branches of our broken cashew tree,” he said, lending a prop to the hut and preventing it from falling and being swept away by the violent current. 
As the water level kept increasing, the terrified couple removed patches of the thatched roof and, craned their necks out and waited for help.  “In that position we kept crying for help for seven hours,” he recalled. 
The couple was rescued after Balakrishnan’s nephew and another relative spotted them.  “The broken branches of our cashew tree made all the difference between life and death. 
Without them, we would have been dead,” he said. 
D.  Samydurai, another resident of the village, said the next day people came to know that ten people had been swept away by the violent currents.  Bodies were found stuck in branches of trees and floating on turgid waters. 
A small-time sound service entrepreneur, Samydurai lost Rs.  45,000 worth of equipment including speakers and amplifiers. 
Samydurai said water from the overflowing mines of the Neyveli Lignite Corporation made things worse. 
Today, the Dalit colony of Periakattupalayam has been reduced to a ghost town with most residents moving to a relief camp nearby.  While most huts have been washed away, tiled and partly concrete tenements are badly damaged. 
Samydurai alleged bias in awarding compensation to those whose houses were destroyed. 
“A landlord gets the same compensation for the loss of a dwelling unit just like a landless labourer,” he said. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Palam Vihar,"Townships hit by outages, discom blames builder  GURGAON: Around 40,000 residents of townships built by Ansal API are facing daily power shortage despite having paid the builder for setting up the necessary infrastructure.  Residents of Sushant Lok, Valley View Estate, API Orchid and Palam Vihar said they have been facing long outages every day, with a 12-hour power cut on December 14 last year among the worst.  They feel they are being made scapegoats in the builder's tussle with the discom, DHBVN. 
According to RTI findings by A L Baveja, a resident of A Block in Sushant Lok, DHBVN has been writing in vain to the developer, asking it to provide land for the requisite substations. 
Letters from DHBVN to Ansal API (copies of which are with TOI) show the inadequacy in the internal infrastructure, as well as establishment of 66kV and 220kV substations, have been conveyed to API a number of times, without any serious steps taken by the builder. 
According to records provided by DHBVN to Baveja, the load capacity in these townships is only one-third to one-fourth of the total demand in most cases.  For instance, the demand at Valley View Estate in Gwalpahari is 7,000 kVA, but the capacity sanctioned by the developer is only 2,000 kVA.  At Sushant Lok, while demand is 6,000 kVA, capacity is only 1,110 kVA.  Baveja's findings, including a notice sent to the builder by the discom, last year reads, "" Inadequacy in internal infrastructure, when compared to the original sanctioned load, comes out to 1,75,353 kVA.  It comes out to 1,30,838 kVA when compared to the infrastructure you have developed so far.  In addition to making up for inadequacy in internal infrastructure, your total load as per norms warrants construction of at least two 66 kV substations and one 220 kV substation to cater to the electricity needs of the areas developed. "" 
The discom claimed the developer had gone ahead with the sale of plots/flats for occupation without making adequate provisions for supply of electricity for them, even though it is duty-bound under licence conditions and the sanctioned electrification plan, to build the substations and external allied power distribution network. 
Vinod Punia, DHBVN executive engineer, from whose office the notices were sent to the builder, said, "" We have served them notices time and again, yet they have not complied with the norms.  This is not an isolated case as there are many such builders who have not fulfilled power infrastructure needs, all of whom have also been served notices. ""  When contacted, officials at Ansal API declined to comment.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  HUDA’s main water pipeline sees 11th leak in 12 months  GURGAON: Leakages were spotted in Haryana Urban Development Authority’s (HUDA) master water supply line yet again near the Basai flyover and in Sector 10 on Wednesday.  In the last 12 months alone, the pipeline has burst 10 times at different places. 
Officials said once HUDA schedules a shutdown of water supply to carry out repairs, at least two-dozen areas of the city will get affected.  However, even before repairs begin, HUDA officials said high-tension DHBVN lines passing right above the master pipeline in the area will first have to be shifted, which will take almost a week.  According to construction rules, no construction or digging activity is allowed directly under or close to high-tension wires. 
The leakages in the line were noticed by MCG officials on Wednesday after residents of Basai village complained of water seeping out of the ground on the adjacent road, a 100 m ahead of the Basai flyover.  HUDA’s sub-divisional officer Vijender Malik said there are two leaks on the 4 km-long master supply line that originates from the Basai water treatment plant and leads up to Hero Honda Chowk. 
“These lines, laid over 25 years ago, have rusted.  It has even affected the thickness of the mild steel pipes, which have corroded from 8mm to about 6mm.  The complication in the repair work is the HT line passing right above the pipeline needs to be shifted at the earliest,” Malik said. 
He explained that apart from corrosion, the pipeline has taken a beating due to constant expansion and contraction from seasonal temperature changes over the years.  “We have conveyed to the DHBVN superintending engineer that the high tension lines need to be shifted at the earliest for a suitable pipeline repair schedule to be decided upon.  The repairs involve welding of valves and collars at both leakage points and would take between 24 and 36 hours,” said Malik. 
HUDA executive engineer V K Sheokand told TOI the pipeline can be used to release water for a couple of more days without tending to the leakage.  However, even slight pressure variations can cause the pipeline to burst.  “The pipeline leads up to the Sector 16 boosting station, from where it branches to various parts of the city,” he said. 
Areas in and around Sushant Lok 1 and 2, DLF 1-4, Cybercity, Cyber Hub, sectors 14-18, 21-23, 23A, 31, 32, 40, Sheetla Colony, Signature Tower, South City-1, Jharsa, Palam Vihar, Sirhaul, Dundahera and Golf Course Road will be affected during repairs. 
The DHBVN superintending engineer was, however, unavailable for comment on when the high tension lines would be shifted to facilitate the pipeline repairs.

Gurgaon fears huge power bills after late meter reading  GURGAON: Residents of Palam Vihar have alleged that their power meter readings were taken a week late for billing, which could result in exorbitant electricity bills for many consumers in the area as there is a flat tariff of Rs 7.25 per unit if the monthly consumption crosses 800 units. 
According to the president of Palam Vihar’s RWA, Sunil Yadav, nearly 10,000 residents in the colony usually receive their electricity bills by 16th of every two succeeding months.  However, bills for the last cycle are yet to be dispatched by power discom Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN). 
“The meter readings were taken more than a week after the usual schedule, which may result in extra units being charged than what should be and will result in higher bills.  There will be cases where even if a consumer uses even unit above 800 units, they will be charged at a flat rate of Rs 7.25 per unit and they will lose the benefit of slab rates,” he told TOI. 
Some residents have even alleged that when they took up the matter with the discom’s sub-divisional officer, Sattar Khan, he told them that “it is his right to bill them however he wants” and refused to explain the delay in the delivery of electricity bills. 
Though the SDO was unavailable for comment, DHBVN’s general manager Sanjeev Chopra said, “I am aware of the bills getting delayed this month.  We are changing the way we are carrying out meter readings and billing.  From this month, readings of all consumers connected via the same feeder will be taken in one group.  This may cause a delay of about a week in this month’s billing cycle, but will be normal from the next cycle. ”
Chopra said that “this measure is being taken to keep a check on the total power input and output at every feeder” in order to keep an account of transmission losses and check the same each month.  “For the consumers, who get charged over 800 units a month, their cases may be considered for correction,” he added.

Power infra must in colonies for completion certificates  GURGAON: Following several complaints by city residents, the department of town and country planning (DTCP) has decided not to issue completion certificates to builders unless electrical infrastructure is installed in their colonies. 
In an order, issued on Wednesday, DTCP director general Anurag Rastogi has asked all officials that no builders are to be issued completion certificates unless they comply with the clause of the license regarding installation of electrical infrastructure in their colonies. 
The order also says that if any builder fails to take electrical connection from the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN), then the DTCP will recover the cost of the same from the builder and deposit it with HVPN so as to ensure power supply to residents. 
"" However, the installation of internal electricity distribution infrastructure as per peak load requirement of the colony shall remain the responsibility of the colonizer, for which the colonizer's electrical services plan and estimates need to be approved by DHBVN before obtaining completion certificates,""  reads the order. 
Rastogi said, "" The said condition is neither being complied with by any colonizer nor is the same being enforced at the time of grant of completion certificate.  It is therefore directed that before passing any such case, the compliance of the said clause in its letter and spirit may be ensured. "" 
Gurgaon is home to a number of such colonies built by private developers, who despite charging residents all relevant costs are denying them the right to power connections.  Various colonies, including Mayfield Garden, Sushant Lok, Palam Vihar, are still suffering due to inadequate electrical infrastructure. 
When contacted, the director of town planning in Gurgaon, Sanjay Kumar, said, "" We will definitely ensure that all completion certificates are issued only after the said clause has been satisfied by the builder"" . 
He, however, refused to comment on what action would be taken against builders who have already been issued completion certificates, though they have not yet provided residents with power infrastructure.

Pipe repairs to hit water supply for two days  GURGAON: Repair work on the master pipeline from Basai water treatment plant will hit water supply in the city for two days, starting January 27, HUDA officials said on Saturday. 
According to the officials, water supply will be suspended for around 85% of the city.  "" Since it is a big line, repairs will take time and the water supply will remain suspended for two days, that is on January 27 and 28,""  said HUDA administrator Anita Yadav. 
Yadav said the pipeline damage had caused leakage of lakhs of litres of water over the past few days.  She added that residents must store water and use it judiciously to ensure they do not face shortage for two days. 
This is the second time that HUDA is carrying out repair work on the master pipeline in three months.  The authority had repaired the water line in three places in November.  However, despite the repairs, the pipeline continues to give a harrowing time to residents.  In the last 12 months, the pipeline has burst 11 times. 
A senior HUDA official said that the lines are over two decades old and has rusted, which leads to cracks at some places.  Apart from the corrosion, the pipeline has taken a beating due to constant expansion and contraction from seasonal temperature changes over the years. 
Areas in and around Sushant Lok 1 and 2, DLF 1-4, Cybercity, Cyber Hub, sectors 14-18, 21-23, 23A, 31, 32, 40, Sheetla Colony, Signature Tower, South City I, Jharsa, Palam Vihar, Sirhaul, Dundahera and Golf Course Road are likely to be more affected during repairs.

'Carterpuri' after 1 day of fame, forgotten for 36 years  GURGAON: Whenever an American president jets in (and there have been seven such visits), residents of one village not too far from Delhi might be forgiven for thinking what the fuss is all about. 
Once there was a place called Daulatpur Nasirabad.  Many years ago, a dignitary came calling, from a far-off land, a man so important that his visit was marked by the rechristening of the village.  The year was 1978, that dignitary was then US President Jimmy Carter, and Daulatpur Nasirabad became 'Carterpuri'.  Though for how long Carter remains part of Haryana's soil is up in the air, for there is talk of going back to the earlier name. 
Not that the move had any salutary effect on the village's fortunes, or improved the lives of the villagers.  Carterpuri is today as nondescript a hamlet as any in north India, one of those urban villages that are neither here nor there, its present squeezed between a humdrum past and an uncertain future.  And like many similarly-sized settlements in the plains, it has been crowded out by a city that has grown unmanageably big, hemmed in by Sector 23 on one side and Palam Vihar on the other. 
Here, small hoardings battle for space with overhead wires.  There's a faint odour of sewage in the air, and muddy tracks lead to nowhere in particular.  Nowhere is where Carterpuri has headed since that red-letter-day 36 years back.  "" Nothing has changed here,""  says a group of women.  "" There is still no road here, nor any sewer. "" 
An old man, now 85 years old, says a lucky few might have benefited in the wake of Carter's tour (he had come, it is said, because he wanted to visit the area where his mother was stationed, as a nurse, during World War II), but apart from receiving a TV set, little else came out of the visit.  "" Life hasn't changed in Carterpuri,""  said a shop-owner.  "" It's pretty much the same as it was when he came. "" 
So while among older folk, there might still be some residual fondness for the time when the most powerful man on earth dropped in on their lives, there's no nostalgia.  Even they resignedly - almost cynically - admit that Carter's stopover did nothing for what once was (and may be again) Daulatpur Nasirabad. 
A change of name might possibly bring about a change in luck, and that's exactly what is being mooted (though it's difficult to get the official position on this).  As is the way with such things in India, renaming seems to have ended up being a political gimmick, a symbolic gesture made to the gallery.  The change has been cosmetic.  Live goes on as usual.  Like it has, and will likely do, for the 10,000 inhabitants of Carterpuri.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Man gets life term for killing lover's husband  GURGAON: Accused of murdering the husband of his paramour, a youth was handed down a life sentence by the court of district judge Harnam Singh Thakur on Friday. 
Badri, aka Pappu of Damoh, Madhya Pradesh, was arrested last year for smashing the head of Rajender Kumar with a stone on May 7.  He intended to marry Rajender's wife, Priyanka, which motivated the murder, the court observed.  Badri and Rajender were labourers and used to stay in the same locality in Palam Vihar. 
The court convicted Badri on the basis of circumstantial evidence, such as the voter ID of the deceased that was recovered from the possession of the accused, a few days after the body was found.  On the insistence of the accused, police also recovered the murder weapon - a large stone - that was lying hidden in the bushes of Sector 22, where the crime took place. 
In a statement to the court, Priyanka said, "" Badri took my husband out on the night of May 7, 2014, on the pretext of helping him find a job as a driver.  But a few hours later, he returned alone and told me my husband is lying unconscious somewhere and would have to be fetched in a rickshaw, for which he demanded Rs 100 and left. "" 
Badri never returned.  The following day Rajender's body was recovered by the police from the Sector 22 green belt. 
Public prosecutor Anurag Hooda said, "" Though there was no eyewitness, the onus of proving innocence lay with the accused, because circumstantial evidence clearly indicated his involvement.  The deceased's wife had also claimed he was the one who took Rajender out alone, after which the husband never returned. ""  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Oldest substations to be relieved of load  GURGAON: Two of the city's oldest and most overloaded substations - at Mehrauli and Sector 23 - will soon get a breather as the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HPVN) is all set to bifurcate the load to other nearby substations. 
"" The load on the Mehrauli substation will be shifted to the Sector 9 substation by April and we are currently working on upgrading the infrastructure.  The load on the Sector 23 substation will be bifurcated to 66KV substations in sectors 4 and 20,""  said Gulshan Nagpal, HPVN's superintendent engineer. 
"" This will ensure that there are no breakdowns like in the past.  Our system will be ready to take the load of the peak summer months of May, June and July,""  he added. 
The Mehrauli road substation supplies electricity to sectors 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Railway road, and the Sector 23 substation supplies power to sectors 23,22,23A, 21, Dundahera, Dharam Colony, Choma village and Palam Vihar. 
Last year, the Mehrauli substation had caught fire twice, once in May and later in August and the residents were left to suffer for over 10 hours without electricity as temperatures soared near 45 degrees and the discom and authorities blamed each other.

MCG moves to tackle stray animals, monkey menace  GURGAON: The municipal commissioner has lodged complaints against 22 pig owners to curb the growing menace of stray animals on the streets, which has long been a bother for residents.  The civic agency has also tied up with Friendicoes, an animal welfare organization, to manage stray dogs and has written to the wildlife conservator of the forest department to control monkeys in residential areas.  According to the joint commissioner (HQ) of MCG, Y S Gupta, the corporation has been receiving complaints about stray animals for months from residents.  These animals, not only worsen sanitation but also bite residents.  "" We had conducted a survey last month and identified about 22 pig owners in the city that were warned time and again to remove the animals from MCG areas, but they didn't.

No revenue stamps at city post offices  GURGAON: Residents are finding it difficult to get hold of revenue stamps following the Haryana government's decision to not have them sold at post offices.  The government says it discontinued sale of revenue stamps at post offices because the postal department charges a 10% commission on every revenue stamp sold.  So, while elsewhere in the country one can buy revenue stamps from any post office, in Gurgaon one has to go all the way to the mini secretariat to buy the Re 1 stamp.  Residents say that in order to buy a Re 1 stamp they have to shell out much more money just to reach the mini secretariat.  "" It is mandated by law to affix a revenue stamp for every cash transaction that is over Rs 5,000.  There are about 36 post offices in Gurgaon but none of them sell revenue stamp which causes lot of inconvenience to the general public as they have to travel a long distance to get the stamp,""  said Aseem Takyar, who filed a Right To Information application on the issue.  He said the issue could be resolved if the state government wanted to.  "" All it needs to do is agree to pay the commission sought by the postal department like every other state in the country that has agreed to do so,""  Takyar said.  "" I filed the RTI in the postal department in Delhi and they in turn forwarded it to several postal offices in the country.  Recently, I received over 500 replies from different post offices and all of them maintained that they received 10% commission from their respective state government for every revenue stamp sold,""  he said.  Takyar said the Haryana government's response said that it stopped selling revenue stamps at post offices in the state from 2007 because the department charges 10% commission.  "" This is something which these two government departments should sort out so that the common man is spared the harassment,""  he pointed out.  Other residents too demanded that this issue be resolved.  "" I went to the post office in Uydog Vihar the other day to get a revenue stamp but was curtly asked to go to the court complex in the mini secretariat to get it,""  said Kavita Sharma, a Palam Vihar resident.

RWA accuses 3 residents of stealing Rs 5 crore  GURGAON: Three residents of Park View Residency in Palam Vihar have been booked for allegedly cheating the society’s welfare association out of Rs 5 crore on the pretext of carrying out maintenance work. 
According to the police, the complaint was filed by S C Kumar, president of the RWA who claimed that three residents had taken Rs 8 crore 27 lakh for maintenance work in flats.  But they did not start the work for several months and evaded questions from the RWA.  At the association’s insistence, they returned Rs 2.90 crores.  The RWA president then lodged a complaint with the economic offense wing . 
After conducting investigations for a month, the EOW found the claims to be true and an FIR was registered at Palam Vihar police station under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) 420 (cheating), 467(forgery), 471 (using forged documents) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC.  “On the recommendation of EOW, an FIR has been lodged against the trio”, said ASI Sanjeev Kumar, the investigating officer.

As it turned out, the killer wanted to bump off his wife over a domestic dispute, but ended up destroying seven families living there. 
The incident took place in Shad Nagar, Palam Vihar.  Anil Kumar (52), a truck driver, has been arrested.  His family stayed on the ground floor.  Kumar had moved out himself since the quarrel.  Firefighters said 12 people were rescued.  Three fire tenders controlled the blaze in an hour. 
Fire department officials said the fire broke out at Ahlawat Apartments around 3am.  Ironically, it was Kumar’s daughter Simran who first noticed the blaze.  She ran to the first floor and alerted two families living there.  She saved three lives, including an elderly woman’s, before helping her mother, Mamata, out of the building.  But her grandmother Kailash Rani got left behind. 
One of the residents, an Air Force officer, A N Verma, said he managed to jump onto the balcony of an adjacent house.  “My son helped me.  We then raised an alarm to alert others,” he said. 
But second floor resident Jagdeep Kumar (32) was not so lucky.  He took his one-year-old son, Aksh, and tried to go down the stairs.  Both were asphyxiated.  His wife, Indu (30), looked for him but fell unconscious.  She has been admitted to LNJP Hospital with 80% burns.  Indu, an engineer, worked in Bangalore but moved here a year ago to be near her parents. 
“A team under the supervision of ACP (Dabri) M Harsha Vardhan was formed,” DCP southwest Suman Goyal said.  CCTV footage from a neighbouring building showed Kumar starting the fire.  He has confessed.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Roadways to discontinue 10 city bus routes  GURGAON: Haryana Roadways has decided to discontinue 10 routes of its city bus service out of a total of 24 routes, in wake of poor response from commuters on those routes. 
A senior official based out of the city bus depot said those routes that were incurring losses and failed to draw commuters’ response will be phased out.  According to sources, the buses that will be relieved from these routes are likely to be deployed on remaining routes, so that they do not lie unutilized. 
The director general of Haryana Roadways, Chander Prakash, has also queried city bus depot officials on the poor response of passengers to these routes.  “There is no point running buses on loss-making routes,” said Trilok Chand, general manager of city depot of Haryana Roadways, Gurgaon. 
The routes that are being discontinued include Dronacharya Metro station to bus stand via Sector 21; HUDA City Centre to Behrampur; HUDA City Centre to Manesar; HUDA City Centre to Palam Vihar and city bus stand to railway station. 
These buses are likely to be put in use on routes such as Gurgaon to Kendriya Vihar, Gurgaon to Basai, Gurgaon to Palam Vihar and Gurgaon to Manesar.

Inderjit to Venkaiah: Old city needs Metro link  GURGAON: Gurgaon MP and Union minister of state for defence Rao Inderjit Singh wrote to his senior colleague and urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar asking for a review of the proposed Metro route from IFFCO Chowk to Dwarka Sector 21. 
Singh in his letter said the planned route, which passes through Palam Vihar, leaves out large section of old Gurgaon.  “I have suggested that the extended Metro rail route should be via Subhash Chowk on Sohna Road, Hero Honda Chowk, sectors 33, 34, 37 (which is a major industrial hub), Sector 10A, ESI Hospital, Sector 4/5 (covering railway station) and Sector 23,” he said. 
Singh wrote that more than half of Gurgaon’s population resides in the old city yet most of the development projects, including the Metro network built by Delhi Metro Rail Service (DMRC) and Rapid Metro, have only been set up to cater to the residents of new city.  “Most of the modern facilities are extended only to residents of new Gurgaon areas whereas the thickly populated old Gurgaon remains deprived,” said Singh. 
The MP said various RWAs had requested him for a revision in the route.  He said the route suggested by him would not only benefit residents of the old city but also thousands of people from Badshapur, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar, who commute to Delhi everyday for work.  It covers major industrial areas, railway station and most of the government approved residential colonies of the old city. 
The 12km IFFCO Chowk-Dwarka Sector 21 Metro line, which could reduce the travel time between Gurgaon and Delhi to 30 minutes, was first proposed in 2011 as a high-speed link but has been plagued by delays ever since.  Several project reports have were prepared, but those couldn’t settle the differences between Haryana government and the DMRC. 
Last month, DMRC gave Haryana three options for extending the Metro line.  The options for the corridor are extending the existing corridors—the Airport Metro or the Blue line (Dwarka Sector-21 to Noida City Center)—or building a new corridor from Dwarka to IFFCO Chowk.

Boy who shot classmate 'kills' again  GURGAON: In a case of history repeating itself, the 14-year-old boy, who had made national headlines in 2007 for shooting his classmate dead in the city's Euro International School, has been booked now at the age of 21 along with his friend for shooting another friend dead in the Sector 21 market on Wednesday night. 
According to police, around 9pm on Wednesday, the accused, Aakash alias Ashu, came in a car with his friend Manish Goga, from Dundahera village, and the two shot at their friend, 23-year-old Manish, who was eating momos at a stall in the market.  They then fled the spot in their car. 
Manish, who is himself a history-sheeter, was rushed to Columbia Asia hospital by his friend Ahmad Sher but he was declared brought dead.  Manish, who is from Muzaffarpur in Bihar, was a friend of the two accused.  Based on the statement of Ahmad Sher, the Palam Vihar police lodged an FIR against Aakash and Manish Goga under sections 302, 120b and 34 of IPC and the Arms Act.  No arrests have yet been made. 
According to police, Manish was a criminal who has been booked in cases of murder, attempt to murder and theft.  He was recently released after serving a jail term for attempt to murder a lawyer in Kapashera. 
Preliminary investigation revealed that Aakash was the same Class 8 boy who in 2007 had not only smuggled his father's friend's gun into Euro International School in Sector 45 but along with a classmate, Vikas, shot another classmate, Abhishek Tyagi.  They had shot Tyagi after a tiff with him some days before the crime. 
A year in the correction home does not seem to have had any impact on the accused.  Azad Singh, father of Aakash, was also accused of conspiracy in that case, but he told TOI that he was acquitted by the court. 
"" My son runs his own factory in Basai now and he could not be involved in this murder,""  Azad Singh told TOI. 
On December 11, 2007, Aakash and Vikas, who had some dispute with Tyagi, reportedly fired five bullets at Tyagi from close range following a fight in Euro International School.  Tyagi, who was hit by four of the bullets, including one in the temple and two on his chest from close range, died on the way to hospital. 
Aakash and Vikas were sent to a juvenile home while the father of Aakash and his friend, Raj Singh Dalal, were also booked.  The revolver used in the crime belonged to Dalal.  The case in the session court is only against Aakash as all other accused have been acquitted. 
Meanwhile, Ravinder Tyagi, resident of Sector 14 and father of the 2007 victim, Abhishek Tyagi, has demanded additional security in the wake of the latest killing by the person accused of having killed his son.  Ravinder Tyagi was given security by police in 2007 on his plea that he felt threatened following the killing of his son.  "" I have sought additional police security,""  he told TOI.

Anoop Rohera, president of the old RWA, claimed Kumar had made false allegations.  "" Since the formation of our RWA in 2013, we got our accounts audited by a competent chartered accountant firm.

Police gear up to decongest Old Del-Ggn Rd  GURGAON: Here’s good news for commuters who face perennial traffic congestion on the busy Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road — traffic police have now geared up to decongest the stretch that is flanked by corporate offices on both sides. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After a week-long trial, some changes have been made in the traffic movement near gate number 2 of the Maruti Suzuki plant in Sector 18 and more changes are on the cards. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Earlier, an opening in the median just outside the Maruti plant would create a bottleneck at the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road junction as the street here becomes narrow.  Vehicles would remain stuck for 30 minutes at a stretch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Traffic would also slow down at two intersections at Carterpuri Road, each within 50 metres of each other. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To deal with the situation, traffic cops and road safety officers have decided to close the right turn for the traffic coming in from Carterpuri Road,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A dedicated U-turn has been made available for the rightmost lane near the Maruti plant’s gate number 2.  The second lane is allowed to either take a U-turn or right turn into Maruti, while a third lane is for free movement towards Kapashera border and Palam Vihar. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides this, another median opening at Old Delhi Road and towards Sarhol T-point on Anath Road has been closed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vehicles coming from Atul Kataria side will not be allowed to turn right.  Instead they have to go straight and take a U-turn in front of Maruti plant’s gate number 2. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the changes are applicable only during the morning peak hours.  “We are doing it only between 8 and 11am and it will be a permanent feature now.  We need a different plan for the evening so this cannot be implemented then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“With the plan in force, traffic movement has been observed to be better than before.  We are still working on the finer details to ensure hassle-free ride on this stretch, power discom officials said on Thursday.  From an average of 210 lakh units in the last week of May to 185 lakh units now, the consumption has gone down by about 25 lakh units in the first week of June.  The rains, officials said, also resulted in the breakdown of about 94 feeders since Monday.  General manager of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), Sanjeev Chopra," told TOI that this reduction corresponds to about 12% of power consumption.  """" The peak supply for May was recorded on May 29 with 231.34 lakh units of electricity being consumed in Gurgaon â the highest so far in May in the last few years.  However", this came down to 187.22 lakh units," 183.25 lakh units and 185.22 lakh units from Monday to Wednesday as a result of a temperature drop. """"  Major areas where supply was affected as a result of these breakdowns over the three days were Jal Vayu Vihar", Sector 31, Jharsa, sector 40 Daultabad, Manesar, sector 38, sector 43, DLF phase 1, Udyog Vihar Sushant Lok-2 , Dundahera, Kadarpur, Palam Vihar, Sohna road, sector 29, sector 15,14 among others.

Alarm in Gurgaon over rise in armed chain snatching  GURGAON: With its wide roads and deserted stretches, Gurgaon has always been a favourite haunt of bike-borne chain snatchers.  A recent, more dangerous trend, though, is now emerging â emboldened (or desperate) snatchers are now using firearms to threaten victims, not just to hand over their valuables, but also to keep them quiet, at least till the crooks make their getaway.  Three incidents were reported in the last 30 days, and they are unquestionably on the rise.  The latest case was lodged with Sector 5 police station and registered under Section 392 (robbery) â acknowledging the use of arms â but police sources accept many cases in the past were recorded by police only as snatching, while others were not registered at all, as is usual.  In other words, statistics are liable to be misleading.  Despite that, 134 cases of snatching have been registered so far in 2015 .  Although police claim some success, around 50% of the cases are yet unsolved.  In the latest case, Surender Yadav, a caterer who lives in Ashok Vihar Phase III," was waylaid.  """" My wife and I were taking a walk near our house", around 8.40pm on Sunday.  Two youths appeared on a black Pulsar bike from behind, stopped near us, and one of them took out gun and asked me to hand over my gold chain.  He snatched it from me, told us not to scream, and rode off.  I keep hearing of such incidents in our area â they are looked upon as petty crime â but I've never heard of a gun being used,  said Yadav.  Earlier on May 29, bike-borne assailants robbed a woman of her gold chain in Ashok Vihar, having threatened her with a gun.  Poonam was just out of her home on her way to work when two bike-borne youths came from behind and snatched her gold chain.  As she cried for help, one of the criminals pulled out a pistol and threa ened her.  Luckily, the police believed her report and lodged an FIR against the duo under sections 279 (rash driving), 356 (assault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property) of IPC and the Arms Act.  Not much has moved in the case since, though.  Sometime in early April, three bike-borne snatchers fled after robbing a biker of his wallet and mobile near Sector 4.  They also thrashed him badly.  Later, on April 14, three bike-borne criminals snatched Rs 5,"300 from a Palam Vihar youth after thrashing him.  And this is the tip of the iceberg.  Many cases of snatching that are reported daily across the city would be elevated to robbery if the police were completely honest.  Here's what a victim had to say about her experience with the police: """" I had my chain snatched a year ago.  For the entire intervening period", there was no action on part of the police.  Then suddenly one day, I got a call from them, asking me to collect Rs 5,000 as my part of their recovery of stolen goods, notwithstanding that my chain was of Rs 70,000.  I'm told the police do not take these cases seriously.  This is what gives the culprits much strength,  said Manju Mishra," who lives in Ashok Vihar Phase III.  """" Our area has open roads.  It is easy to escape.  Criminals are gaining confidence", and snatchings are turning into robberies,  said Ajit Rathi, a resident of Sector 5.  The state government is now awake to the menace.  Snatching was recently made a non-bailable offence in Haryana," with the sentence increased from two years to a maximum of 10-14 years.  """" We're aware of the rise in number and violence of these crimes.  We will form special teams to nab the culprits.  We have also deployed plainclothesmen and are committed to preventing crime in the city",  said Gurgaon police commissioner Navdeep Singh Virk.

The reason for this, claim state department officials," is the lack of workshops in the city bus depot.  """" The city depot doesn't have the workshop for additional buses.  The available space barely caters to the existing fleet of 180-200 buses.  We have already written to the government to add the capacity of workshop but things have not progressed any further",  said a senior official of the state transport department on the condition of anonymity Once additional space is made available only then can more buses be added to the fleet of city depot,  added the official.  Currently there are 4,100 buses in the state," out of which just 200 ply on Gurgaon roads.  Hundred buses each run on the inter-city and intra-city routes.  Although the city is set to get two more bus stands — at Sector 29 and at Rajiv Chowk — these will also not have any workshop space.  """" Rajiv Chowk bus stand has an area of 5 five acres while the other one has 3 acres.  We can't set up a workshop in such a small area",  said the official.  More than 70,000 commuters use the city bus services which cover Sohna Road, Railway station, IFFCO Chowk, MG Road, Old Delhi Road, Dronacharya College and Huda City Centre among others.  However, the frequency of the buses is low," and commuters are made to wait for as long as an hour at times.  """" One can't rely on buses for the daily travel.  If I have to reach Huda City Centre from old Delhi Road", there is a city bus service that covers this distance but instead of waiting for the bus for 40 to 50 minutes, I would rather take a shared auto,  said Rishabh Sinha, a resident of Palam Vihar and a daily commuter.

The woman, said to be in her mid-20s, taking the long-delayed project past another major hurdle.  The petitions concerned a 1.3km stretch of the expressway in Gurgaon near New Palam Vihar, where a settlement was reached in May between HUDA and 350 families who will be displaced by the project.  While that had helped free a 2.5km area from litigation, Friday's verdict cleared a contiguous stretch, paving the way for construction to begin.  But not all legal hurdles before the project are gone.  A lawyer representing some of petitioners said a few more pleas remained to be heard by the court.  While dismissing the pleas, the high court allowed the petitioners to construct houses in the sectors developed by HUDA according to the settlement.  HUDA has offered to resettle the petitioners in sectors 37C and 110A.  To facilitate construction, the state government had framed a resettlement plan in consultation with families in and around New Palam Vihar.  Most families accepted it, leading to the breakthrough in May, but some refused to budge.  The high court subsequently granted them time to dwell upon the proposal again before dismissing their pleas on Friday.  The Dwarka expressway, or Northern Peripheral Road, is an 18km long artery that will serve as an alternative link between Gurgaon and Delhi and is expected to ease traffic on the existing expressway.  Land for the road was acquired in 2008-2009.  Construction of a major portion of the Dwarka expressway has been completed.  Several housing projects have also some up in the area.

While the civic authorities blamed this year’s “unusually heavy rains” for the waterlogging, experts say the fault lies in the design of stormwater drains and rainwater harvesting pits. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“There is a major engineering flaw with the design of stormwater drains and rainwater harvesting pits in the city.  Most of the pits have been made at an elevated area.  Besides, there is only one outlet of all stormwater drains in sector areas.  There should have been 18-inch-wide master drains, a city-based expert. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Water body 'acquired' for realty use  GURGAON: A water body on HUDA land in Sector 47 faces extinction because of hectic real estate activity around it, mirroring the faulty approach to planning that has robbed Gurgaon of groundwater recharge sources and at the same time waterlogging-prone, as the recent spell of rain showed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Residents of the area and city-based environmentalists fear 'Jharsa johad' (village pond) may vanish soon as the development authority is selling off land around it to builders and also constructing roads. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 It is surprising that HUDA doesn't understand the importance of a natural water body for people living close to it,  said Virender Tyagi, there will be no outlet for rainwater, which will make the situation worse,  he added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some residents are planning to file a complaint at the CM window.  """" Our house lies very close to the water body and it is in the low-lying area.

However, continuous construction activity in the region killed it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not just natural water bodies, unplanned construction has also blocked water channels and drains that interlinked them.

'Palam Vihar is drowning due to HUDA's faulty storm drains'  When we -my sister and I - were looking to build a house, we bought the cheapest plot adjoining the railway tracks.  But it was green and peaceful.  We were among the first residents in D block, Palam Vihar.  The railway track didn't bother us, as few trains ran on the narrow gauge track.  Some years later, it became a broad gauge, and the noise levels and frequency of trains increased.  The supposed green belt nearby had a few trees, but the roads here hardly had any next to them.  We used to park our cars under the few trees that existed.  Slowly, we planted many trees in the 'green belt' and on roadsides, and the environment turned lush.  Enthused, we planted more and created a green buffer.  This was until six years ago, when HUDA cut through the green belt to make an underground storm drain.  It was supposed to be an outlet for the water.  Instead, it began spewing a backflow of rainwater-cum-sewage.  Since then, our troubles have compounded with each passing year.  A short spell of rain means flooding everywhere - roads, basements, the green belt.  The stink of sewage is unbearable.  We dread to step out, even to buy essentials.  During the rains, we often have to take leave from work, as the day is spent battling rainwater which floods our basement, and fear of electrocution looms large.  The outer walls of our houses have turned into death traps.  This year seems particularly bad.  While our friends are celebrating what appears to be a good monsoon, we are busy pumping sewage from our house.  On Sunday, waste water seeped into our underwater tanks.  We had to drain out the entire tank and refill it with fresh water.  The whole house was under three feet of water.  The stink is there a day-and-a-half after the water subsided.  That's not it.  Outside, this water stands for weeks, and cases of dengue and malaria are common in our neighborhood.  Now we dread every outpour.  This is no way to live.  I can't begin to express how much we miss our neighbourhood's mofussil past. Vijaya Ghose is editor of Limca Book of RecordsDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Youth with dual dengue, malaria infection dies  GURGAON: A 20-year-old man from Jhajjar died in a Gurgaon hospital on Tuesday due to a rare concurrent dengue and malaria infection.  He was first admitted to a hospital in Basai around two weeks ago with high fever.  On October 16, when his condition deteriorated, he was referred to Columbia Asia Hospital in Palam Vihar.  Diagnosis revealed he had both dengue and malaria infections.  According to doctors, a dengue- malaria concurrent infection is more severe than single infections," with a greater risk of deep thrombocytopaenia and anaemia.  """" It affects the body's immune system.  When the patient was brought to the hospital", his condition was critical and his blood pressure low.  We admitted him in the ICU on the first day.  Later, as his condition deteriorated, we had to put him on ventilator.  We made all efforts to save him, but he passed away due to multiple organ failure,  said a Columbia Asia spokesperson.  Though it is still a rare phenomenon," doctors termed it as a challenge for medical fraternity as such cases are increasing with each passing year.  Some doctors say that as many as 10% cases of dengue are now combined with either malaria or typhoid.  """" We have seen an increase in cases where patient is attacked by dengue as well as malaria or typhoid.  Almost 10% dengue cases have been detected with other viruses.  Poor sanitation conditions in the city are responsible for it",  said Dr Rajesh Kumar from Paras Hospital.  Dr Kaya Bhanot, an independent consultant, said," """" Quite a few patients have come with dual infection of dengue and malaria this year.  Patients with dengue fever have poor immunity"," which makes them vulnerable to other infections.  First one week is very critical for a patient. """"  Doctors also said that the chances of mortality increase in case of concurrent infections.  """" Dengue is generally curable", provided patients see doctors in time.  However, dual infections increase the risk of mortality.  Dengue and malaria is a deadly combination.  Poor sanitation conditions in the city are cause of a rise in dual infections,  said Dr Anuradha Pandey from Mayom Hospital.  This year, 333 cases of dengue have been reported in the city so far.  Even though district authorities have not confirmed any dengue deaths, private hospitals have reported four such deaths.  Last year, 135 cases of dengue were recorded, while in 2013, the number stood at 375 with three deaths. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Muslim artisans camp in city to create effigies of Ravana  GURGAON: Every year, around this time of the year, Raju Khan leaves his hometown, Aligarh, and travels to some city, where he and his men get busy for a month or so.  This year, he came to Gurgaon - his first visit here - and set up his 'camp' at the community centre in Sector 5, where he and his other Muslim artisans have been busy making Ravanas.  The tallest Ravana he has made this year towers at 195 feet.  But you won't see it burst into flames in Gurgaon; that was for a party in Punjab.  In Gurgaon, says Khan, he has received orders for two 70-feet Ravanas, and that's the tallest in the city.  These two are headed for Sohna and Palam Vihar.  There's plenty of demand for effigies," he says.  """" Though the demand has gone up", our business has come down because a lot of local artisans have taken up the profession,  says Khan.  Khan and his team work under a contractor, a man who goes around states," chooses the artisans and brings them here for Dussehra.  The group has been in town for over a month now.  """" One big Ravana takes approximately a month to make",  says Imran Khan, another artisan.  The creators of these effigies have received orders for 18 Ravanas in Gurgaon, the smallest of which is 30 feet, and the tallest 70 feet.  While the craze for big effigies remains," shorter Ravanas are popular among residents of Gurgaon.  """" Since people want to avoid the crowd at the bigger Ramlilas", they have started burning effigies of Ravana within their own colonies,  says Sunil Gihara, a small-time artist from UP who is also in town for the season. So, one can find effigies as small as 3 feet, going up to 20 feet for individual or community celebrations.  A 3-foot Ravana will cost anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 1,0, and men like Raju will end up making as much as Rs 25,000 this season.  But more than the money," it's the fulfilment that matters most to Raju and his men. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Squatters in way of basic amenities  GURGAON: The state government has rejected a proposal to recognise New Palam Vihar as an """" authorized colony""""  under a special legal provision", meaning its 60,000-odd residents will have to wait longer for legal water and power connections and other basic amenities like sewerage lines and streetlights.  Under the Haryana Management of Civic Amenities and Infrastructure Deficient Municipal Areas (Special Provisions) Act,2013, the Congress government led by BS Hooda had allowed the municipal bodies to provide basic amenities such as water, power and streetlights to residents of 400 unauthorised colonies across Haryana.  The criteria were that as of June 30, 2009 an unauthorized colony should have a minimum built-up area of 50% and should be outside the restricted 900-metre area around the IAF ammunition depot to be authorised.  The government's reins have since passed from Congress to BJP, but officials said the regime change has nothing to do with the rejection of the New Palam Vihar plan.  Rather, the urban local bodies (ULB) department is cagey about unauthorised constructions in the area, a part of which is within the restricted IAF depot zone.  The size of this restricted zone is the subject of a hearing in the Punjab and Haryana high court, which has said it will consider reducing the area only if the state government promises to remove all encroachments in the 300-metre area around the depot.  A shoddy job by the civic authorities also did the proposal in.  The ULB, Haryana's parent municipal department, has pointed out several discrepancies in the way the proposal on New Palam Vihar was formulated by the MCG and sent.  In Gurgaon, 44 colonies have been given basic amenities under the special provisions law.  The MCG had sent another list of nine unauthorized colonies, including New Palam Vihar in Old Gurgaon," to the state government so that these could also be considered.  An official said one of the main reasons why the ULB decided not to include New Palam Vihar in its fresh list is illegal constructions.  """" There are strict directions issued to local authorities to remove unauthorized constructions from this area.  But it appears that due to collusion with some corrupt officials", these illegal constructions remain and the state government has rejected the proposal by us to include New Palam Vihar in the list of approved colonies,  said a senior MCG official.

The new trend in town is dog farmhouses.  Dog enthusiasts in the city are taking the idea of dog crèches to the next level.  In the new-generation dog farms, not only is there someone to take care of pooches during the festive season or vacations, they also train them and make them do exercises.  Gurgaon currently has two private dog farms, Alfa 11 and Kennelone.  Both are spread across huge areas, with training, swimming pools, individual air-conditioned kennels and a customised diets on offer.  In these, they score over the 'pet hotels' that were last year's rage, which, despite the luxury, are confined spaces.  The facilities are a relief for dog owners, especially around Diwali," when the noise and smoke make them excitable.  """" This year will be my 10-month-old Beagle's first Diwali", hence I've already dropped him off to Kennelone,  says Rohit Raina, corporate communications manager at Jindal Stainless Ltd.  Raina added that the festival season is a terrible time for dogs as they are sensitive to noise, and end up curling up in a corner.  He's glad such dog farm facilities have come up in Delhi-NCR.  Bhavna Garg of Alfa 11 says," """" We see at least a 50% hike in the number of people approaching us to take care of their dogs during the festive season. """"  She added that given the fact that our farms are away from the hustle bustle of the town", it's a perfect hideout for the dogs during the festive season.  Rates at Alfa11 are Rs 800, Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,200 a day for double or single occupancy, and additional facilities.  Ashu Ruben, one of the owners of Kennelone, agrees.  He says there's a substantial hike in enrolments during the festive season, as the farms are havens of quiet.  This, despite the costs, which at Kennelone, start from Rs 600 a day and rise with different breeds and dietary needs.  Expectedly, there is a rise in the number of such facilities in Gurgaon recently.  At these farmhouses, not only are dogs away from the noise, they get the full vacation treatment, with AC bedrooms," swimming pool and playgrounds.  """" I'm a single working woman and often I do not get time to take my dog out for a walk.  Alfa 11 arranges for a dog's day out every Tuesday", which is perfect,  said Bani Kurup, who does freelance editing.  She added that the Palam Vihar farmhouse she prefers has pick-up and drop facility, which suits her fine as she lives in south Delhi.  The trend is spreading for other pet species, too.  For hamsters, guinea pigs and cats," Petstop in Sushant Lok offers home boarding facility.  """" We try to recreate the feeling of home here",  said Petstop owner Vinzel Atheya.  Petstop houses small pets for Rs 200 a day.  For cats, it charges Rs 600 and rates go up to Rs 700-Rs 1,000 a day for larger breeds and species.  Animal lovers, though, sound a word of caution.  Many feel though the idea is great," the facilities need to maintain a personal touch in dealing with pets.  """" Unfortunately", sooner or later, most such facilities become commercial and start stacking 40 pets in the space for half the number,  says Amit Chaudhary of People for Animals.

The highest price quoted by a bidder was Rs 13.5 lakh," against the base price of Rs 1.25 crore.  """" The price quoted by bidders were very low", so we decided to cancel the auction.  Now we will forward the matter to the chief administrator for further direction,  said HUDA estate officer Omprakash.  The expressway was sanctioned in 2007 and was expected to be ready before the 2010 CWG.  But in 2008, several writ petitions were filed by New Palam Vihar residents, challenging the acquisition.  As a result, construction of a 1.3 km stretch of the road had to be withheld.  On the direction of the high court, alternate plots were recently allotted and compensation given," to families affected by the road construction.  Huda said the previous auction on August 28 was cancelled as there were no bidders.  """" To encourage bidding", we reduced our base price by 123% to just Rs 1.25 crore.  This time, bidding began at Rs 1 lakh, but did not go beyond Rs 13.5 lakh, leading to cancellation of the auction,  said an official.  Bidders said the structures to be demolished are such that they will not get bricks or other saleable material after demolition, especially with scrap prices quite low these days.

Supply channel damage may hit city water supply  GURGAON: Several parts of the city are likely to face water shortage on Wednesday and Thursday after a portion of the Gurgaon water supply channel, which brings Yamuna water from Sonepat to the city, collapsed on Monday near Chandu village.  The irrigation department has already started the repair work.  Areas which are likely to face shortage include Old Gurgaon, sectors 4,5,7, 7 (extension),9, 9A, 10A, 12A,21,22,23, Palam Vihar and nearby areas.

It will be re-released from Mudakhedi after the repair work is complete.  It will take around 12 hours for the water to reach the treatment plant after being released from Mudakhedi, so, in all likelihood, Gurgaon residents will face water shortage on Thursday as well.  HUDA SDO Subhash Piplani said the Basai plant has a 100 MLD storage capacity, while it supplies 52-56 MLD to Gurgaon everyday.  So HUDA can continue supplying water till Wednesday, but in case repair work is delayed, there might be shortage on Thursday.  Meanwhile," the damage to crops has left villagers fuming.

'Scuffle' over complaint on power bill  GURGAON: A group of residents of Park View Residency in Palam Vihar alleged they were manhandled by officials of the power discom on Tuesday.  They alleged the discom officials also snatched their mobiles phones when they had gone to the its office to sort out irregularities in their electricity bills.  And adding insult to injury," police did not register the residents' complaint.  Anoop Rohera said he and some other Park View residents have been going to discom DHBVN's office for about two days but there was no official to be seen.

They tried to push me out of the office and threatened to lodge an FIR against me for taking pictures,  he said.  Other residents pointed out that DHBVN generates a single bill for the whole society, which is later distributed to its residents by the RWAs.  The bill generated by the RWA adds generator, common area, commercial, and recreation area charges because of which most Gurgaon residents, who live in condominiums," do not have access to details of their electricity bills and they have to pay what is demanded by the builders or RWAs.  This non-transparent system gives room for errors in electricity bills and gives scope to builders and RWAs to make money out of it.

When TOI contacted SDO Vikas Yadav," he denied that any such incident took place on Tuesday.  """" People can claim anything but no such incident took place",  he said.

Huda plans waste disposal, collection sites for sectors  GURGAON: Waking up to the hazards of dumping garbage in the open, Huda has decided to identify sites for waste collection and disposal in its sectors.  Currently, empty plots are being used as dumping sites in the absence of designated spots.  Huda administrator Anshaj Singh said estate officers have been directed to prepare a plan for developing garbage dumping and collection sites in each sector," the first of which will be developed in Sector 31.  Singh said all the garbage from a sector will be collected at these dumping sites before being transported to the solid waste treatment plant at Banwari village on Faridabad road.  """" We have identified the place for first dumping site in Sector 31",  said Singh.  Garbage from sectors 30,31,40,41, South City-I, Jalvayu Vihar and nearby areas will be collected here.

Power lines to be shifted to clear path for Dwarka e-way  GURGAON: Work on Northern Peripheral Road (NPR), commonly known as Dwarka expressway, is likely to gain pace as the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN) has agreed to shift the high tension lines on the road.  According to Huda officials, there are 12 towers on the stretch between Kherki Daula and Dwarka, and Rs 19.54 crore has been transferred to HVPN to shift them.  Out of this, Rs 11.32 crores will be used to shift two 220 kV towers and rest will be used to shift 10 towers of 66 kV each.  Executive engineer Arun Dhakad said the development authority had asked HVPN to shift the high tension lines in September, but a delay in approval was caused due to funds being stuck with Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam.  Dhakad told TOI that Huda had deposited Rs 13.5 crore with DHBVN to shift high tension lines on the Sohna-Gurgaon Road underground in 2013.  Although the project got cancelled, the amount transferred was still with the discom.  The nod from HVPN to shift the lines came after DHBVN agreed to transfer the amount to HVPN.  A senior official of DHBVN said the transfer of funds was agreed after Huda's chief financial officer approved it.  The expressway, which was sanctioned in 2007, was earlier expected to be ready before the 2010 Commonwealth Games, but has seen a number of delays.  In 2008, a number of writ petitions were filed by residents of New Palam Vihar, challenging land acquisition for the project.  As a result, a 1.3 km stretch of the road could not be undertaken for construction.  As of now, work on 15.5km-long section of the road has been completed, and construction of 1km-long railway-over-bridge (RoB) is under way. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Dwarka e-way oustees to get plots in Sector 110A  GURGAON: The Dwarka expressway project crossed a major hurdle on Wednesday after the Punjab and Haryana high court resolved the dispute over allotment of plots to New Palam Vihar families by directing Huda to allot plots in Sector 110A instead of Sector 37C.  More than 380 families had approached the high court as they were against the development authority's decision to give alternative plots in Sector 37C in the absence of adequate number of available plots in Sector 110A.  The high court, however, has directed Huda to allot the plots to displaced families in Sector 110A through land pooling scheme.  Sources said the government has decided to relax the norms related to land pooling to accommodate all the families.  The resolution clears one of the biggest obstacles in the way of the expressway project and is likely to expedite construction work.  A 1.3-km stretch of the road could not be undertaken for construction owing to the land dispute.  Huda administrator Hardeep Singh said Haryana's additional chief secretary will come to Gurgaon on December 27 to discuss all the issues related to expressway construction, including allotment of plots.  He said senior officials would visit the area and take a call on the next course of action.  Singh said about 464 houses in New Palam Vihar, Tekchand Nagar, Kherki Daula and Mohammadpur are falling in the way of the expressway.  The expressway was sanctioned in 2007 and was expected to be ready before the 2010 CWG, but in 2008 a number of writ petitions were filed by New Palam Vihar residents challenging the acquisition of land for the expressway.  On the directions of the high court, Huda had agreed to allot alternative plots to residents whose houses were coming in the way of the proposed road.

The 25-year-old woman and her husband had gone to the hospital for a blood test when the incident took place. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The technician asked my wife to sit inside a room and drew the curtains.  He then asked me to get a separate slip for my blood test.  While I was standing in the queue to get the slip, my wife came running to me and said the technician had touched her inappropriately,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He then called the police and also informed his family, who resides at the nearby Carterpuri village. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soon, a large number of villagers gathered outside the hospital and demanded that the accused be handed over to them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Akash was acquitted as he was a juvenile then.  The two were involved in many criminal cases together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manish made several attempts to eliminate Akash, but he managed to escape each time.  “Akash then decided to kill Manish.  He called him to the market that day.  As per the plan,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ved Prakash Godara. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While Goga and Manjeet have no previous criminal involvements, Ashok was involved in a murder in 2011 and was out on bail. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2007, the then 14-year-old Akash had smuggled a gun owned by his father’s friend into Euro International School in Gurgaon and shot dead a classmate Northern Peripheral Road soon a reality The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday dismissed the last bunch of the pending writ petitions concerning the over-delayed Northern Peripheral Road (NPR) or Gurgaon-Dwarka Expressway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would also allow the petitioners to construct houses in the planned sectors of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 150 m wide NPR is an important 18-km long road provided in the Development Plan of the Gurgaon-Manesar Urban Complex linking Dwarka and South-West Delhi with Gurgaon-Manesar and beyond. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The land for the road was acquired in the year 2008-2009.  Though a major portion of the expressway stands constructed, a number of writ petitions were filed by residents of New Palam Vihar challenging the acquisition. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consequently, 1.3 km stretch of this important road could not be undertaken for construction.  In order to facilitate the construction of this important artery and also to provide relief to the petitioners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This settlement was framed after having detailed discussions with the petitioners.  The settlement was placed before the Punjab and Haryana High Court and after due consideration, the High Court disposed off number of writ petitions in its earlier order on May 20.  Since, near the stretch along National Highway No-8 did not accept the settlement proposals, the High Court granted them time to dwell upon the proposals and had fixed the hearing for May 29. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In view of the fact that these petitioners did not agree to the settlement, these writ petitions were heard on May 29 and after detailed arguments the order was kept reserved.  On Friday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The litigation had held up about Rs.50,000 crore of investment by property buyers.  Now that a settlement between the government and the affected people has been reached,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Real estate developers and flat owners were delighted by the High Court order as more than 100 private housing projects have come up along the NPR.  Life halts in waterlogged Millennium City Just a few hours of rain on Thursday brought the Millennium City to a standstill, rendering major roads waterlogged and several posh colonies flooded. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just two hours of rain and the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) control room was inundated with calls regarding water-logging complaints. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We have received several calls since the morning about water-logging.  The calls were forwarded to the Junior Engineers concerned for necessary action.  It was a hectic day for us at the control room,” said a call attendant at the MCG control room. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though the worst-hit areas were Sector 28, DLF Phase-I, complaints poured in from Chandan Nagar (Sector 15), Sector 14, Jaikampura, Old-Delhi Road, Sector 4, Sector 5, Palam Vihar, Sector 21, Sector 22 and Sector 22A, Sector 23, Sector 28, New Palam Vihar and Sushant Lok-I. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Roads had almost turned into rivers, making it impossible to drive.  It took me double the usual time to reach Sector 15-II from Sector 23 around noon.  There was water and water everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When contacted, the authorities passed the buck. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Most sectors that witnessed water-logging have already been handed over to the MCG for maintenance and are not the responsibility of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA).  We have completed de-silting of storm drains before hand.  The water is bound to collect at low-lying areas, so we made arrangements to clear water-logging in these areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The waterlogged roads also slowed down the traffic on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and major sector roads.  A major traffic jam was reported at Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway around 8 a. m.  There were also traffic snarls on Gurgaon-Faridabad Expressway. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“I took almost an hour to return home after dropping my son to school in Sector 62.  Water-logging across the city left the traffic crawling,” said Sector 31 resident Sandeep Jain. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The harassed residents took to social media to warn others about water-logging and traffic congestion.  Some of them even criticised the authorities for failing to handle the situation, even posting pictures of the water-logged roads. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rain on Tuesday had witnessed similar scenes — water-logging and traffic snarls — across different parts of the city.  A 10 m portion of Golf Course Road had caved in about 15 feet near Bristol Chowk.  Two arrested for molesting woman Four youths allegedly passed lewd comments at a young woman, and abused and beat up her husband at MGF Metropolitan Mall on Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road here.  Two persons have been arrested in this connection. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The incident occurred when the woman, who heads the human resource at a private company, were on their way to a restaurant after the movie when four youths allegedly made vulgar gestures at the woman. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“When the woman told her husband about it, the man followed them to a washroom.  The accused allegedly beat up and abused the woman’s husband inside the washroom.  Soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the victim and her husband said that the accused were four in number, the police said that there were only three. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The victim’s husband, in his complaint,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two of the accused have been identified as Kunal Jaiswal, a resident of Sector 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A first information report was registered at the DLF Phase-II police station on August 3. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cases of crime against women are rampant on Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, also known as “Mall Mile”.  The stretch is a popular entertainment, fine dining restaurants, theatres, and pubs. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The incident occurred when the woman, who heads the human resource at a private company, IFFCO Chowk metro station, Manesar, Old Delhi Road, Signature Tower, Cyber City, and the HUDA City Centre metro station. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, a DLF Phase-I resident. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Similarly, the road beneath the IFFCO Chowk metro station was completely inundated.  Sunil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other areas that witnessed water-logging were Signature Tower, HUDA City Centre metro station, Wazirabad, Manesar, Miyanwali Colony, and Sector 9,10,15,17,18,21,22, 23 and 44.  The roads of major licensed colonies such as Sushant Lok-I, Ardee City, Mayfield Gardens, Nirvana Country, South City-I, and Malibu Town were also submerged. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With the roadsides filled with water along Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, kanwarias could be seen walking on the highway.  “The lane marked for us is filled with water at several points.  We know it is dangerous to walk on road, a kanwaria.  Third time's no charm The third edition of Car-Free Day was observed on Tuesday without the usual hype and enthusiasm surrounding the weekly event. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unlike the earlier two occasions when Gurgaon Police Commissioner Navdeep Virk and the other senior officers showed a lot of enthusiasm towards the event and were visible on the roads promoting it, this time around it seemed a cold affair with the senior police officers and the organisers being inaccessible. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last press statement from the Gurgaon Police regarding the event was also issued on October 2.  The third event, it said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The area of focus will be Udyog Vihar.  Each police station will also motivate and involve at least five residents’ welfare associations to join the movement.  The Gurgaon Police along with private initiatives will make all efforts to make it a huge success,” read the statement. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Car-Free Day selfie contest, introduced by Mr.  Virk a week ago, but this time around he also chose to stay away. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though the police and the organisers refused to comment on why the lukewarm response, it is believed that the dispute between Mr.  Virk and Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Bharti Arora — the two officers had publicly levelled allegations against each other over a case pertaining to rape — led to polarisation between the force with both factions disowning the event. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, cyclists could be seen plying on the tracks and few vehicles were parked on the roads on the four identified corridors.  A cycle rally was also carried out by the police promoting use of public transport and school students were seen standing near Unitech Cyber Park holding placards urging people to avoid using their cars.  The Gurgaon Police also thanked Maruti Suzuki India for collaborating on the third Car-Free Day. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The organisers claimed that the Car-Free Day has gained momentum among many. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Car-Free Day selfie contest failed to evoke any response with not a single selfie being posted on the Twitter account of the Gurgaon Police Realtor’s murder leaves police clueless More than two days after a young realtor was chased and shot dead at a fuel station in Palam Vihar here, the Gurgaon Police are groping in the dark over the murder. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We have recovered both motorcycles used in the commission of murder.  While the accused had left one of the motorcycles at the fuel station, the other motorcycle was recovered today.  But the registration number of both was found fake.  We are yet to establish the identity of the accused in the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The murder took place when Raju,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As soon as Raju stepped out of his Mahindra Scorpio, two armed young men already present in the fuel station began chasing him.  Sensing danger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The entire incident was caught on the closed-circuit television camera installed in the premises of the fuel station.  The CCTV footage shows that the assailants had come riding pillion on separate motorcycles.  While those driving the motorcycles wore helmets, the assailants did not cover their faces.  One of the assailants wore a cap. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“My brother had a rivalry with another realtor.  He had also taken contract to repair a road, which might be the reason behind his killing.  Raju had told us about some unidentified persons following him for the past 10 days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Raju had reportedly sought police protection a fortnight ago but his request was turned down.  Mr.  Singh denied having received any request from the victim.  Police suspect the murder to be the handiwork of contract killers.  The footage suggests that attackers had complete knowledge about Raju's activities.  Residents of old Gurgaon seek Metro link With the Haryana government likely to give its nod to the Detailed Project Report for a Metro link between Gurgaon and Dwarka, residents of old Gurgaon feel neglected.  They have now suggested a new alignment passing through several sectors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“It is a matter of deep concern that all modern facilities are being extended by the administration to new Gurgaon.  Old Gurgaon, which has a major portion of the population of Gurgaon, while people in old Gurgaon are suffering enormously and have equal fundamental right to such facilities,” said Mr.  Yadav. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A letter written to Mr.  Khattar earlier this year read: “. the Metro is a very important means of communication and it has to be provided after due deliberations and consultations with the wide range of people and the representatives of the area. We have consulted a wide range of people, the residents’ welfare associations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr.  Yadav said that the route suggested by them covered the entire old Gurgaon, which included several residential sectors, hospitals, the industrial hub and the railway station.  It will have huge ridership and be financially viable.  The entire route would be over ground with a low cost of construction,” said Mr.  Yadav. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Earlier, Union Minister and Gurgaon MP Rao Inderjit Singh had also written to Mr.  Khattar suggesting the same route. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In July, the Haryana government had rejected all the three routes suggested by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation in its recent Detailed Project Report (DPR) for an alternative metro link between Delhi and Gurgaon as being “financially unviable”.  Two of the routes were the extension of the existing Airport and Dwarka-21 Metro lines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rejecting the DPR, the Haryana government has asked the DMRC to suggest a route with slight alterations for the extension of the Dwarka Sector 21 Metro line, shopping malls, transport complexes, commercial buildings and hospitals, has declared most almost all of these to be disabled-unfriendly.  Among the prominent buildings that failed to qualify as disabled-friendly are Galleria Market, Leisure Valley, Sector 29 HUDA market, General Bus Stand, HUDA City Centre Metro station and the Kingdom of Dreams. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only two buildings — Ansal Plaza (Palam Vihar) and Ambience Mall — seemed to have adhered to the parameters laid down.  Both buildings scored 94 out of 100 marks. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Judged on a scale of 100, all buildings fared poorly with scores less than 42.  The survey was conducted jointly by the Red Cross Society, which were fixed taking into account 14 basic amenities, included ramps, escalators, platform lifts, stairs, railings, handrails, doors, corridors, restrooms, emergency exits and assistance for the disabled.  The survey assigned 14 marks each to ramps and escalators and six marks each to the other parameters.  According to the report, very few public and private buildings were found to have disabled-friendly toilets or ramps.  Also, they were found lacking wheelchairs and reserved parking lots.  Further, none of the toilets were found fitted with disabled-friendly accessories such as handles and western commodes.  Public parks, including Leisure Valley, did not offer disabled-friendly amenities. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Transport facilities for the disabled are very poor.  There are no especially-designed cabs available.  Metro stations are highly unfriendly for use by the disabled. Construction work is not stopping at HUDA City Centre.  Outside the station, three-wheelers leave no space for the wheel chair to move.  How can we expect disabled people to use the Metro in such conditions?” the report said.  The report added that major markets like Galleria and Super Mart were also not disabled-friendly.  In fact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The report said that the General Bus Stand has no wheel chair, while the buses are not disabled-friendly.  In such a case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About the Kingdom of Dreams, the report said that the entrance to the auditorium had 20 steps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The aim was to assess the level at which Gurgaon has been able to integrate disabled people into society.

Chinna Muttom,"37 ‘intruders’ ‘intercepted’ in Operation Hamla Thirty-seven ‘intruders’ were identified and nabbed on Wednesday during Operation Hamla, an anti-terrorism security drill under way across the coastal districts in Tamil Nadu, according to Additional Director General of Police, Coastal Security Group, C.  Sylendra Babu. 
The bids at ‘infiltration’ were foiled in Chennai, Nagapattinam, Mandapam and Tuticorin. 
Dummy bombs were seized at six locations.  In Tuticorin district, 10 ‘intruders,’ including five at sea, were intercepted. 
For the first time, 500 fishermen joined the CSG in ‘identification’ and ‘interception’ of ‘intruders’ in this mock exercise, Dr.  Babu told The Hindu . 
Apart from a fleet of 24 fast interceptor boats of the Tamil Nadu Coastal Security Group, 15 fishing boats were involved in Operation Hamla.  With the support of fishermen, whom he called ‘eyes and ears’ of vigil, dummy explosives were seized in Nagapattinam. 
The 48-hour exercise, which commenced at 6 a. m.  on Wednesday, involves active participation of 5,000 personnel, including officers of coordinating security agencies like Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, Coastal Security Group, Central Industrial Security Force, police force from 13 coastal districts, Chennai City police and Customs and Fisheries departments. 
With four-tier security blanket, surveillance was increased at sea, shore line and also at territorial level across the State, Dr.  Babu, the operation coordinator, said. 
As part of the two-day Operation Hamla, the district police began mock combing operations in the coastal areas of Kanyakumari district. 
Vigil has been mounted in the coastal areas from Arockiyapuram to Neerodi. 
Hundreds of police personnel were pressed into service with a view to creating awareness among people of the need to be vigilant over suspicious movement of any persons in their locality. 
The CSG undertook patrolling at sea from Chinnamuttom fishing harbour, apart from taking up shore patrolling on motorcycles in Colachel, Manavalakurichi and Neerodi. 
Additional personnel were posted at Colachel and Chinna Muttom check posts, police sources said.  Fishermen seek ban on fishing near coast A group of representatives from coastal hamlets in the district submitted a petition to Collector M.  Karunakaran on Tuesday seeking a ban on fishing by mechanised boats from Chinna Muttom fishing harbour in areas close to their villages. 
In the petition, the representatives said fishermen from nine coastal hamlets of the district, with their fibreglass boats and catamarans, were still following the traditional fishing practices while the mechanised boats operating from the neighbouring Chinna Muttom fishing harbour near Kanyakumari were practising trawling methods that seriously affect marine wealth. 
When the mechanised boats, in a bid to have better catch, had their operations close to the coast, it often lead to the destruction of traditional fishermen’s fibreglass boats, catamarans and their fishnets and subsequent clashes. 
Even though several rounds of talks were held with the mechanised boat fishermen, no amiable solution had been arrived at yet. 
Hence, the Collector should ban fishing operations by mechanised boats in areas close to the coast.  The mechanised boats should leave the Chinna Muttom harbour by 7 a. m.  and return to base before 10 p. m. 
To ensure this, a chain should be tied across the entry-exit point of Chinna Muttom harbour.  They should not be allowed to practise ‘stay fishing’ that would allow them to stay in the deep sea up to one week, they said. 
The damage caused by mechanised boats to the fibreglass boats, catamarans and fishnets should be adequately compensated. 
Above all, the uncontrolled and illegal use of high power engines up to 450 HP in the mechanised boats should be banned and officials attached to the Department of Fisheries should conduct frequent checks, the petitioners also said. 
Fishermen from Koottapuli, Perumanal, Thomaiyarpuram, Idinthakarai, Uvari and Koottappanai met the Collector and submitted the petition.

Representatives from coastal hamlets in Tirunelveli district submit petition to Collector Case against two fishermen Kanyakumari police have registered a case against two fishermen of Chinna Muttom on a charge of threatening Assistant Director of Fisheries Subramanian.  According to the police, I.  Silvestre (52) and another unnamed fisherman had violated the department’s order to adhere to fishing timings at Chinna Muttom Fishing Harbour on June 30.  Though the officials used winch rope to prevent fishermen from entering the sea for fishing after 9 p. m. , the two had allegedly damaged the rope and prevented Mr.  Subramanian from discharging his duty around 9.30 p. m.  Based on a complaint filed by the official, Kanyakumari police have registered a case.  Further investigations are on.  Invasion of mechanised boats rocks fishermen grievance day meet The first-ever fishermen grievance day meet was held at Radhapuram in the district on Friday, in which a good number people from coastal hamlets aired their grievances and sought effective solutions for perennial problems. 
The foremost issue that rocked the meet was the invasion of mechanised boats from Chinna Muttom fishing harbour which carry out fishing operations close to the coast, often triggering mid-sea clashes among fishermen. 
Fishermen from Koottapuli said that the district administration should take firm measures to stop indiscriminate fishing in the region close to the coast at odd hours by the mechanised boats operating from nearby Chinna Muttom harbour. 
“Since the mechanised boats damage fibreglass boats, fish nets and even kill fishermen on the high seas, they should be banned or regularised.  Besides finalising permanent fishing timings for the mechanised boats, the district administration should allocate funds from Kudankulam Neighbourhood Development Programme for constructing a groyne in their village,” Jude, a fisherman from Koottapuli, said. 
Register cases
Chairing the meet, Collector M.  Karunakaran instructed the Coastal Security Group police to register cases against the mechanised boats that carried out fishing operations near the coast and damaged the fibreglass boats. 
Former panchayat president of Uvari S. V.  Antony said that a good number of cancer patients and 85 persons suffering from renal failure and requiring periodic dialysis in Uvari were undergoing treatment. 
Since there was an alarming rise in such cases, the Department of Public Health should conduct a comprehensive study in Uvari to ascertain the problems causing these diseases. 
“Moreover, a dialysis unit under the supervision of qualified technicians should be established at the Primary Health Centre in Uvari,” Mr.  Antony said. 
Dr.  Karunakaran said that a detailed study would be conducted in coastal villages about this issue and adequate medical facilities would be made available for these serious ailments in government hospitals close to coastal villages. 
Drinking water scheme
“Moreover, the drinking water scheme planned under Kudankulam Neighbourhood Development Programme at a cost of Rs.  68 crore will be commissioned as early as possible,” he assured. 
Another group of fishermen wanted liquor shops running close to their villages to be removed.  Search boat to be stationed at KKNPP jetty Kanyakumari-based State government’s ‘search boat’, which used to be pressed into service on getting SOS from fishermen in distress at the high seas, will be stationed at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) jetty soon, Collector M.  Karunakaran said. 
Raising this issue at fishermen’s grievance day meet held at Radhapuram on Friday, some of the participants said that the search boats meant for Tuticorin and Kanayakumari districts had been anchored in harbours in the respective districts, and hence search operations could be commenced immediately on getting distress calls from fishermen. 
However, there was no ‘search boat’ for Tirunelveli district though it had 13 coastal hamlets, they said. 
Dr.  Karunakaran said the ‘search boat’ meant for the district had been anchored at Chinna Muttom fishing harbour as there was no proper jetty or harbour in Tirunelveli district.  When some of the participants pointed out the availability of a jetty at the KKNPP, the Collector ordered the fsheries officials to station the boat at the KKNPP. 
S. V.  Antony of Uvari and Liguori of Kooduthaazhai appealed to the Collector to ensure construction of a fishing harbour at an appropriate spot in the district so that the Tirunelveli fishermen, who had been practising traditional fishing methods with small fibreglass boats, could switch over to modern fishing practices with mechanised boats.  Stalin of Idinthakarai demanded a cold storage facility for the village.  A group of fishermen from Koottapuli appealed to the Collector to sanction permanent concrete houses being built under ‘KKNPP Neighbourhood Development Programme’ to their village too, which was immediately accepted. 
Dr.  Karunakaran said that a branch of Indian Overseas Bank would be inaugurated at Koottapuli, and asked the villagers to cooperate with the bank in identifying a building.  Some of the fishermen suggested that the unused community hall in the hamlet could be used for the purpose. 
“If the bank wants to convert it into a branch, we’ll bear the expenditure,” they assured.  The Collector said that the branch at Koottapuli would be ready for inauguration before September-end. 
When the fishermen raised the problems they were facing on high seas from the Coastal Security Group and the Indian Coast Guard due to the absence of identity cards issued by the Fisheries Department, Dr.  Karunakaran ordered the officials to initiate the work in this regard and complete it within a month.  Search boat to be stationed at KKNPP jetty Kanyakumari-based State government’s ‘search boat’, which used to be pressed into service on getting SOS from fishermen in distress at the high seas, will be stationed at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) jetty soon, Collector M.

‘Boat for Tirunelveli district anchored at Chinna Muttom’ Fishermen net rocket shell Fishermen from Kanyakumari netted a rocket shell in the sea near Chinna Muttom on Monday. 
Vincent and three others had ventured into the sea from Chinna Muttom on Sunday night.  When they were fishing one and half nautical miles from the shore, they found a metal object like a rocket-shell weighing over 12 kg and measuring 2 feet in their net.  They immediately alerted the Coastal Security Zone (CSZ) personnel, who recovered the shell . 
An official attached to CSZ told The Hindu the Bomb Disposal Squad from Madurai has been summoned to defuse it.  Fishermen had netted a few rocket shells in 2007 in Kanyakumari.  Boat held by country craft fishermen released A mechanised boat from Kanyakumari with 10 fishermen aboard was detained while they were engaged in fishing close to the shore of Periyathalai in Tuticorin district on Saturday.  They were held captive by the country craft fishermen of Periyathalai for trespassing into their waters in violation of Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1983. 
When mechanised boats fish within three nautical miles close to the shore in violation of the Act, nets cast by country craft fishermen suffer damages spoiling their livelihood.  Hence, enforcement agencies should keenly monitor such violations and prevent such incidents.  Joint Director of Fisheries, Tuticorin region, R.  Amal Xavier, told The Hindu that the fishermen, who were held captive, from Chinna Muttom, had been released after a meeting involving Fisheries Department officials from Kanyakumari and Tuticorin district was convened at Periyathalai. 
During the meeting, the local fishermen were assured that steps would be taken to prevent trespassing in future.  It was their only demand, Assistant Director of Fisheries (Marine), Tuticorin, P.  Isaac Jeyakumar said.  Mechanised boat fishermen from Chinna Muttom on strike A large number of fishermen from Chinna Muttom abstained from fishing from Tuesday midnight, demanding the government to allow them to carry out multi-day deep-sea fishing, said Fr.  Churchil, secretary, South Asian Fishermen Fraternity (SAFF), here on Thursday. 
Fr.  Churchil told The Hindu that fishermen from Thoothur, Colachel and Muttom were allowed to go for multi-day fishing.  Thoothur fishermen used to stay in mid sea for 30-50 days, whereas fishermen from Colachel and Muttom were allowed only 7-10 days of deep-sea fishing, he said.  Multi-day deep-sea fishing would fetch a good catch for the fishermen, and who could also save considerable money spent on fuel. 
The fishermen had gone for multi-day fishing for 4-5 days for the last one month, but they were allegedly told by the Additional Director of Fisheries to stop this practice last week.  “When the government permits international vessels to stay in Indian waters for any number of days, why the Indian fishermen are not permitted for deep-sea fishing for multiple days?” asked Fr.  Churchil.  “Deep-sea fishing helps the fishermen earn a decent income and generate foreign exchange for the country as well,” he noted. 
Chinna Muttom fishermen met the Collector and other officials recently to press for their demand.  But they were told to wait until Deepavali festival got over, he added. 
Now, about 4,500 fishermen from Arogyapuram, Chinna Muttom, Manakkudi, Keezha Manakkudi, Kanyakumari and Rajakkamangalam and other coastal villages, who used to venture into the sea from Chinna Muttom, participated in the strike.  When contacted, a Fisheries Department official said the problem would be sorted out once construction of Colechel and Thengaipattinam fishing harbours was completed.  Rain with heavy wind in Kanyakumari Due to the low pressure formed over the South West Bengal Sea, intermittent rain with heavy wind continued on Friday in Kanyakumari district.  The coastal villages from Arogyapuram to Neerodi experienced gale on Thursday night.  The sea was rough with high tides lashing to a height of 15 to 20 feet on Friday morning. 
As a precautionary exercise, the fishermen kept off the sea.  While mechanised boats remained anchored at sea, small boats were kept on the shore. 
As a result of this, the busy fishing harbours in Chinna Muttom and Colachel were deserted.  Intermittent rain lashed the catchment areas of the dams.  Colachel and Kannimar areas experienced moderate rainfall.  A maximum rainfall of 15.2 mm was recorded in Puthan Anai.

A 15-minute gale uprooted several trees on the Collector’s office premises and blew off tiles glass window panes in several residential areas, which have been affected by inundation in last week’s rains.

Two students and an ayah sustained injuries, while 22 other children escaped with minor bruises. 
The minibus was contracted to ferry children of Vidyashilp Academy, near Jakkur Flying Club.  The accident happened around 1.45pm on Double Road, near Arkavathy Layout, off Jakkur Main Road, north Bengaluru. 
Investigations revealed the driver, Vijendra Kumar, 28, was driving rashly, and lost control over the vehicle over a sloping stretch.  He braked suddenly, in a bid to avoid hitting the road median, sending the vehicle toppling. 
The bus had travelled about 2km from the school and was headed towards Kalyan Nagar and Ramamurthy Nagar to drop children.  The injured ayah, Devi, 42, immediately alerted the school about the incident. 
Driver Vijendra jumped out of the vehicle and pulled all the students out through the door.  Passersby helped him, even as the school rushed an MUV and ambulance to the spot.  The children were taken to a private nursing home nearby, and administered first aid. 
While the rest were sent home, Niharika Muttanna K of Kalyan Nagar and Advay Santosh Nair, both class 1 students aged 7, and Devi, a resident of Doddabanasawadi, were referred to Columbia Asia Hospital, Hebbal, for further treatment. 
Niharika, with an injury on her forehead, was shifted to the general ward, while Advay underwent a minor procedure for cuts suffered on his head and right ear. 
Devi, who suffered a fractured right hand, was discharged around 4.30pm. 
Yelahanka traffic police arrested Vijendra, from Mysuru, on charges of driving in a rash and negligent manner.  He was subjected to an alcohol test and doctors confirmed the findings were negative. 
The school was working half-day in view of a farewell function.  As the photo of the school bus lying on its side went viral, the school messaged parents: “Nothing serious has happened.  All are safe and have reached home. ”
However, Kalpana Mohan, principal, Vidyashilp Academy, who visited the hospital, said: “Twenty-two students in the bus sustained minor injuries and were given first-aid.  Niharika and Advay were shifted to the casualty ward of Columbia Asia.  Doctors confirmed that both are out of danger. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Chaos in hospital after farmer dies of H1N1  BENGALURU: Chaos prevailed outside Koshys Hospital, Ramamurthy Nagar, east Bengaluru on Wednesday afternoon over the death of a 45-year-old farmer, suspected to be suffering from H1N1.  Nagaraj Muniyappa was initially admitted to Koshys Hospital but was moved to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) almost a week later where he was declared brought dead.  Later the body was moved back to Koshys, where doctors claimed they were treating Nagaraj for low BP when he was in reality dead, his kin alleged.  But Koshys Hospital authorities said they were only examining the body as per hospital norms.  Nagaraj, a farmer from Chintamani in Kolar district, was brought to Koshys Hospital last Thursday with symptoms of pneumonia.  On Wednesday morning, his family decided to shift him to Rajiv Gandhi hospital after his condition deteriorated. 
M Narayanaswamy, a family member, said Nagaraj was kept in ICU of Koshys Hospital where doctors never allowed the family to speak to him.  âWe suspected something amiss and decided to shift Nagaraj to Rajiv Gandhi hospital.  Koshys Hospital doctors put Nagaraj in an ambulance around 12.30pm,â Narayanaswamy said. 
At Rajiv Gandhi hospital, doctors declared Nagaraj brought dead. 
Dr Shashidhar Buggi, director of RGICD, confirmed that the patient was brought dead.  âAt 1.30pm, Nagaraj was brought by 108 ambulance.  As we were told it was a critical case, our anaesthetist went inside the ambulance.  The patientâs heart beat was nil and there was no pulse.  He was brought dead.  We informed the same to the patientâs relatives.  There was no admission made,â he said.  The family members rushed back to Koshys Hospital with the body where doctors took the body inside and examined it for 30 minutes before confirming the death.  âNot knowing that Rajiv Gandhi hospital doctors had declared Nagaraj dead, Koshys doctors said they are treating him for low BP.  Sometime later, doctors came out and said Nagaraj was dead,â Narayanaswamy said.  Claiming the test was a hospital norm and that Nagaraj seemed to have died en route to RGICD, KB Mukesh MD, Koshys Hospital said, âThe family just rushed back from Rajiv Gandhi hospital and accused us of treating a dead body.  We needed to cross check and thatâs why we examined the body. â
However, the family said they will not file any police complaint.  Nagarajâs death is not included in the health departmentâs list of persons who died due to H1N1 on March 4. 
HOSPITALSPEAK
Lab reports confirm that Nagaraj, who was admitted six days back, had severe pneumonia and tested positive for H1N1.  We had alerted his family that his condition may deteriorate.  Bowing to family pressure, we agreed to shift him to Rajiv Gandhi hospital.  We had tested his pulse and heart beat before shifting him to ambulance and he was alive KB Mukesh | MD, Koshys Hospital

Virudhunagar MLA recevies death threat  MADURAI: Virudhunagar MLA, K Pandiarajan, who had been fighting political heavyweights in the district over acquisition of land for a railway overhead bridge (ROB) in the constituency, reportedly received am anonymous death threat on Saturday. 
The MLA received threats at his office and on his Facebook page, warning that he would lose his head if he interfered in the ROB issue. 
A complaint has been lodged with police. 
The construction of a ROB in Ramamurthy Nagar in the heart of Virudhunagar town, which recently received court approval, has been a bone of contention for a long time.  The railway line in Virudhunagar town intercepts the town into two halves.  The level crossing there is closed 88 times a day, causing inconvenience to the public.  Despite public demand for an ROB, several people who owned land where the bridge was supposed to come up, including former DMK minister K K S S R Ramachandran, opposed the idea. 
In January, 2012, K Pandiarajan filed a petition urging the court to pass a direction for the construction of ROB.  On March 31 this year, the court ordered the government to go ahead with the construction.  Recently, two DMK councillors from the Virudhunagar municipality have gone to court against the ROB and obtained an interim injunction on the same. 
Speaking to TOI, Pandiarajan said he saw the threat as a desperate attempt to stop the ROB works.  Instead of the 28 people who had gone to court earlier opposing the bridge, only two had now sought an interim injunction, clearly showing that their numbers were dwindling, he said. 
"" An empowerment committee, comprising experts from the government and the railways, came out with a report that said the railway under bridge was not feasible, as it would involve bursting of the rocky surface in the region.  After this, the court passed orders and tenders were called.  Tenders will be opened on May 13 or 14,""  he said. 
Pandiarajan met the Superintendent of police, S Maheswaran, who assured him of action against the unknown people who issued the threat.  Since the threat was also made on his Facebook page, the cyber wing too will investigate the matter, sources said.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  CM's convoy inconveniences Bengalureans  BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah went on an inauguration spree on Friday, declaring open police stations at Kothanur, Ramamurthy Nagar and Bagalur, a flyover at Nagavara, grade separator near Kanteerava Studio junction and a few other civic projects that have already been thrown open to the public. 
Inaugurating a police station in Kothanur, Siddaramaiah urged the police department to connect with the peo8ple and work with a citi8zen-friendly approach as it will help them prevent crimes more efficiently.  "" Preventing all crimes is not possible, but if every station has a good connect with people, police will be able to get tipoffs, which will help prevent crimes,""  he said. 
The CM was accompanied by home minister KJ George and Bengaluru city in-charge minister Ramalinga Reddy.  Besides, the CM's convoy had at least 40 cars belonging to local Congress leaders and workers, and tens of people welcomed Siddaramaiah at every spot.  The movement and stopping of these vehicles inconvenienced Bengalurea8ns wherever he went.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Rationalist files complaint against practitioner of 'dynamic science'  MANGAURU: A Mangaluru-based rationalist has filed a complaint against a person who claims to cure cancer with 99% success rate to the health minister, drugs controller of Karnataka and the director of Ayush. 
Narendra Nayak, president, Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, who filed the complaint under the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act.  Nayak accused him being a quack, saying he opened his shop in Bengaluru and posted details on Facebook.  Nayak said claims of 99% cure cannot be made even by the most advanced facilities in the world. 
"" If this were to be true, it would be a revolution indeed and a life-saving therapy for millions of cancer patients.  If it were false, it should invite criminal prosecution for the claimant identified as Dr Shaji V Kudiyat,""  said Nayak. 
When contacted, Dr Shaji said he has a BHMS degree from the Homeopathic Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, MD in Homeopathic Philosophy from Vinayaka Missions Homeopathy College, Salem, PG Diploma in yoga from Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu and also PG certificate in counselling from St Theresa's College, Ernakulam.  "" I combined all these three on the basis of a new scientific hypothesis called 'Dynamic science'.  In some cases, surgery is recommended but done outside and not by us,""  he said. 
He said DNA and the vital force are interconnected.  "" The problem with cancer is with material philosophy which is the base of science.  They destroy the tumour and fail to identify the root cause which produces the tumour.  We try to identify the cause,'' he added. Dr Shaji, who has been practising for the past four years in Ramamurthy Nagar, Bengaluru, said he recently came to Mangaluru to attend a cancer conference at Fr Muller College.  Nayak said: "" The person claims to be practising something called dynamic science which is not listed under any system of evidence-based medicine or under Ayush.  He claims to be a homeopath and if he practises anything else, it would mean cross practice which amounts to malpractice. ""  Dr Shaji said, "" I'm a licensed practitioner and a qualified person.

Inquiry against private hospital The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has taken up a suo motu inquiry against a private hospital in Ramamurthy Nagar for alleged medical negligence and cheating. 
Nagaraj (45), a resident of Chintamani, was admitted to Koshys Hospital in Ramamurthy Nagar a week ago for H1N1.  Unable to cope with mounting bills, the family got him discharged on Wednesday and shifted him to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases where he was declared brought dead. 
The family has now alleged that the private hospital had treated a dead Nagaraj for almost a week and fleeced the family. 
BBMP officials visited the private hospital.  They found that the hospital had not maintained proper records.  Relatives of patients want doctors to be more sympathetic With the doctors’ protests gaining momentum, families of patients who suffer owing to alleged medical negligence state that there is a need for doctors to be more “sympathetic” towards patients and their families. 
Justice seems far
Rashmi R. , aunt of Mariam Kouser, the four-year-old who suffered brain damage owing to alleged medical negligence in December 2013, said her niece continues to be in a vegetative state and shuttles in and out of hospitals. 
Although a case has been filed with the Medical Council of India, justice seems far for the family. 
“Her life will never be the same.  There is a need for doctors to be more responsible.  Doctors see several patients a day and sometimes tend to delegate work to their juniors.  For them, it might be just another case… but for patients and their families, the doctor’s role is crucial.  There is a need for doctors to be more sensitive to their needs.  The damage caused is irreversible,” she said. 
Narayanswamy, whose brother died earlier this month owing to alleged medical negligence at a private hospital in Ramamurthy Nagar, said, “Doctors in private hospitals refuse treatment if we do not pay money.  It is a testing time for us and tempers may run high.  Doctors should be considerate and must provide treatment first, as sometimes it is a matter of life and death. ”
There is a need for doctors to be more responsible.  Doctors see several patients a day and sometimes tend to delegate work to their juniors.  For them, it might be just another case. 
Rashmi R. Aunt of Mariam Kouser CCB busts scam in PDS stock It’s been a month since Central Crime Branch officers busted a major scam involving transportation and selling of rice meant for the Public Distribution System (PDS) to rice mills in and around Bengaluru, but little progress has been made in the case. 
On March 24, the CCB nabbed three persons red-handed while transporting 50 tonnes of rice to mills in Kolar for processing and selling in the open market for higher prices.  The suspects were handed over to the jurisdictional Ramamurthy Nagar police for further investigation. 
The prime suspect, Satyamurthy, is a resident of Jayanagar.  He claimed to have been carrying out this business for the many months in nexus with some officials of the Food and Civil Supplies Department and the owners of fair price shops in Bengaluru, indicating that the seizure was just the tip of the iceberg. 
The police had remanded the trio in judicial custody and sent notices to the officials concerned seeking an explanation.  They are yet to get a response. 
Joint Commissioner of Police M.  Chandrashekhar, who heads the CCB, said that they would take over the investigation considering its sensitivity and potential scale of the scam. 
“We suspect it has wide-scale ramification with officials of the Food and Civil Supplies Department and touts not only duping the State government but also beneficiaries of the PDS. ”
Trio were transporting 50 tonnes of rice to mills in Kolar for processing and selling in the open market Groom dies in accident A bridegroom who was on his way to invite relatives for the wedding died in an accident in Madiwala on Monday morning. 
Koti Reddy (28), a resident of Kodichikkanahalli, was working in a private firm in Kundalahalli.  His bike was hit by a water tanker from behind.  Madiwala Traffic police registered a case and arrested the tanker driver. 
Jewellery shop looted during power cut
A man looted a jewellery store in Ramamurthy Nagar during a power cut amidst heavy rain on Sunday evening. 
He entered the shop in Dasappa Layout around 8.45 p. m.  and asked to see a ring.  The shopkeeper took out a tray containing around 40 rings for him to select. 
The man threw chilli powder into the face of the shopkeeper and fled with the tray.  The store owner has lodged a complaint with Ramamurthy Nagar police. 
Chain snatching
Two unidentified persons snatched a gold chain of around 20 grams from Sudha (65) while she was on a morning walk near her house in Tilak Nagar on Monday morning.  Traffic jams, loud crackers greet citizens as CM inaugurates civil works in city Bengalureans faced another day of bumper-to-bumper traffic and noisy celebrations as Chief Minister Siddaramaiah inaugurated major civil works in the city. 
Beginning from his residence at 11 a. m. , Mr.  Siddaramaiah first inaugurated the flyover at Kanteerava Studio junction, built at an estimated cost of Rs.  46.98 crore.

Traffic jam
Commuters were irate as vehicles were stopped at Outer Ring Road and other places to make way for the CM's convoy, leading to a huge jam at Outer RIng Road.  The convoy was followed by the private vehicles of local leaders.  With crackers being burst on the road, several vehicles were forced to stop and the traffic police struggled to regulate traffic. 
A reader questions the Chief Minister's prescience in conducting the inauguration on a weekday:
>@BloreConnect just a week back, Hon'ble CM told that he will do city rounds only on Sundays to avoid traffic jams!!!— VENU GOPAL (@u_venugopal) >June 19, 2015
Mr.  Siddaramaiah later inaugurated the skywalk at Kammanahalli on Outer Ring Road, as well as Kothnur and Bagalur police stations.  The CM chose not to speak at any venue, and instead cut the ribbon and waved at party workers before setting out to the next point on his agenda.

linga Reddy said that Rs.  460 crore had been sanctioned to develop and asphalt major roads in the city.  The work to be executed by the Public Works Department will begin on Saturday, he added.  He blamed the previous BJP government and BJP-headed BBMP Council for the poor state of affairs in the city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Home Minister K. J.  George said that no other Chief Minister has focused so much on the city's development. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'Focused on solving garbage problem',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mr.  Siddaramaiah said that """" no real development happened when BJP was in power. """"  He added that his government was focused on solving the garbage problem.  He claimed that the State government had solved the Mandur crisis and had now turned its attention to Doddaballapur.  He urged citizens to segregate waste at source", adding that an amount of Rs.  250 crore had been earmarked for desilting strom-water drains.  Trio arrested on theft charge Bengaluru: In a desperate bid to get out of jail, in the Bangalore Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara helped an associate get bail so that the latter could commit theft to fund his legal battle in the Supreme Court. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His associate burgled 15 houses and put together booty of Rs.  22 lakh.  But a tip-off landed him and his gang in the police net.  The arrested are Meenakshi (40), owner of eatery near the prison; Seena Padu (22),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the jail premises, Seena and Govindaraju became friends.  As Govindaraju was in need of money to fight his case in the Supreme Court, Seena was out on bail in January.  Since then he engaged himself in stealing valuables from different places and then he would hand over the booty to Meenakshi at her eatery near the prison In turn she would hand it over to Raju (26), another habitual offender, who would pawn the valuables using his contacts and get the money. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The trio — Raju, Meenakshi and Seena — would keep a small portion of the money with themselves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCB officials have taken the two men into custody and are trying to ascertain for how long have the two been involved in the racket. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a similar case in March this year, CCB officials busted a racket where rice meant for State-sponsored Anna Bhagya Scheme was stolen to be sold in the open market. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Police seized rice sacks worth Rs.  10 lakh and handed over the case to the Jurisdictional Ramamurthy Nagar police, but the case has not moved any further since then.

The police said that Kiran Kumar D. , son of Vijay Raj,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Investigation revealed that Kiran, after returning from school,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He headed to his room without eating lunch. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She immediately alerted her husband who in turn informed the police.  A case of unnatural death has been registered at Ramamurthynagar police station.  Bengaluru civic polls: BJP gets clear majority In the end, it turned out to be a return of the BJP and an embarrassment for the ruling Congress and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.  The BJP won 100 of the 198 seats, in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Council while the Congress improved its tally from 64 to 76. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adding insult to injury, BJP leaders claimed that this was the first time in 30 years in the State that a ruling party was defeated in the civic polls. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The results have raised serious doubts over the plan to trifurcate the BBMP, which the BJP opposes; the bill is pending with the President of India.  Given the bitter anti-BJP campaign by the Congress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chief Minister Siddaramaiah owned responsibility for the defeat but said that the result couldn’t be considered a referendum on the State government.  The result could galvanize the CM’s rivals within the Congress who have been demanding a cabinet expansion. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The council will be dominated by first-timers.  Two women have won from wards that were not reserved for women.  This would be the first time that there will an equal number of women and men.  While one of out of five councillors are worth more than Rs.  5 crore, nearly half have studied only till Class X or lesser. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reacting to the victory Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in tweets: “People’s continuous faith in the BJP is humbling and gladdening.  We are fully committed to fulfilling aspirations of 125 crore Indians.  After Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BBMP poll results complete a hat-trick of wins for BJP.  This is a win for politics of development and good governance. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BJP chief Amit Shah and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were quick to slam the main opposition party, asking it to introspect over its “negative politics. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“This victory is people’s mandate against the continuous anti-poor, anti-development and politics of negative allegations being practised by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice president Rahul Gandhi.  Congress,” Shah said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“The idea is to find differences in billing, unauthorised connections,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The long-term plan is to map the connections and tally BWSSB records with that of the BBMP.  The project runs concurrently with the ambitious UFW (Unaccounted Flow of Water) project, which seeks to plug leakages in three key areas of the city.  He suspected violations in sanitary connections to be as high as 15 per cent and illegal water connections around 4 per cent. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only 27 officials have submitted their reports so far.

KR Puram traffic police have registered a case under section 304A.  Know how top cops of Bengaluru take different paths to make the IT capital crime-free BENGALURU: With the city police now bifurcated into east and west divisions, the uphill task of making India's IT capital crime-free rests on two senior IPS officers who,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Additional Commissioner (West) Alok Kumar is driven by the need to strengthen the policing mechanism by integrating traditional methods with the modern.  Additional Commissioner (East) P Harishekaran wants to curb crimes by establishing stronger links with the public, including criminals.  And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The need for the two officers to evolve their own ways came after the government redesignated them.  Earlier, Kumar was the additional commissioner (law and order) and Harishekaran was additional commissioner (crime) for Bengaluru city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Accordingly, Kumar is responsible for maintaining law and order for north, whereas Harishekaran heads east, northeast and southeast divisions. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With his brief now clear, Kumar is now moving ahead to beef up policing. He has created a new beat system to keep watch on neighbourhoods,  Kumar said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harishekaran, on the other hand, southeast and northeast are the areas where people come from outside the state, most of them living in the slums. It is here that 65% of crimes take birth,  said Harishekaran, who has already visited 12 slums. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both east and west parts of the city have infamous crime hotspots.  Under Kumar falls Upparpet, Rajagopal Nagar, who has most IT companies in his limits, is wary of Halasuru Gate, DJ Halli, Pulikeshi Nagar and Ramamurthy Nagar areas. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Improving the beat policing and supplementing it with WhatsApp groups would help bring down crimes in the city as we will have every movement in an area under our watch, and people can give us information directly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BDA had in 2009 first mooted a plan to construct a new complex at Indiranagar but it didn't progress. The complex has space for 57 shops on the ground floor but fewer than half of these are open.  On the second floor is the regional transport office that will move to a new building in Ramamurthy Nagar in a few months.  The shops are mostly centred around RTO work," such as driving schools and may move to near the new RTO.  """" The building is very old.  We are going to move to new building shortly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eastern Freeway,"Crawford market parking attendant caught on tape charging Rs 300, held  MUMBAI: Overcharging for parking even at BMC lots in south Mumbai is not a secret, yet little action is taken.  Prompted by numerous complaints, a non-profit ran a sting operation on the extent of the extortion recently to goad the police and the civic body into action. 
Still, only a lowly parking attendant has been arrested with the cops saying they are checking if they can widen the scope of the probe.  Interestingly, the parking lot that was targeted is located next to Crawford market and opposite the police commissioner’s office.  The BMC headquarters is also a stone’s throw away.  Afzal Khan, who runs Adarsh, the NGO that conducted the sting, said they had received several complaints that the private contractor running three parking lots in the area was overcharging.  “There were several complaints that despite paying five times the official rate, people were not getting parking slots.  As a result, there were huge jams at Crawford market, the mouth of JJ flyover and the Eastern Freeway.  Hence we decided to do a sting operation,” said Khan. 
In the first week of December, as crowds were peaking for Christmas at Crawford market, Khan’s friends Toushaf Shaikh and Asif Sayyed went to the parking lot with a car with a Tamil Nadu registration.  “We kept our secret camera on as we entered the parking lot.  It was afternoon peak time when the attendant told us at the entrance it will cost Rs 300 per hour.  When we asked why they were charging so much, he said it was the rate.  We agreed and paid.  The conversation was taped,” said Shaikh. 
The accused were found parking even outside the marked areas, prompting traffic chaos.  The attendant had bragged to the team that they had greased the palms of cops, traffic policemen and BMC officials. 
Based on Adarsh’s complaints, the Azad Maidan police on Monday arrested Anees Ansari, 43, an employee of the BMC contractor for Crawford market area, and booked him for extortion and cheating.  Sources claimed the contractor has appointed sub-contractors to run the parking lot. 
“We have gone through the CCTV footage and it appears that the accused were demanding more than the official charge.  They have even done forgery.  We are probing if the scope of investigations can be further widened,” said Narendra Singh, senior inspector Azad Maidan. 
“I am not aware of the incident.  I can comment only after getting information about the issue,” said a senior BMC official. 
At the moment, the BMC charges uniform parking rates across the city (see box).  A proposal to revise the rates three fold and levy varying charges according to location has been cleared by the BMC improvements committee but pending with the general body for over a year.

Towing service man cons navyman, held  MUMBAI: If your car breaks down and you need to tow it to a garage, don’t call a service from a number on the Internet, as you may get conned. 
The city crime branch’s property cell on Friday arrested a 27-year-old man, who under the pretext of towing away a car belonging to a naval officer, fled with it and also duped him of Rs30,000.  The police arrested Zubair Khan from Dharavi and recovered the Santro belonging to the officer from Navy Nagar in Colaba.  “The accused admitted to have similarly conned a Pajero owner recently.  We are checking if he is involved in anymore cases,’’ said inspector Nandkumar Gopale. 
Last July, the officer was driving along the Eastern Freeway when his car met with an accident.  “He contacted a call centre, whose number he found on the net, and it gave him two or three towing service numbers.  When he called one number, a man came immediately and towed away the vehicle.  He offered to repair the car cheaply,’’ said investigating officer Deep Bane. 
The accused, along with the complainant, towed it to a garage in Bandra.  The accused, claiming it was his garage, said the repairs would cost Rs30,000.  The officer immediately paid him Rs10,000, and promised the rest when work began.  Within two days, the accused said he urgently needed the remaining amount to complete the work.  The officer handed him the amount near Regal theatre at Colaba, not realizing that he was being duped.  Two days later, when the officer tried calling, the phone was switched off.  When he went to the garage, its actual owner said he did not know him.  The Sewri police have registered a case of cheating, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Dhananjay Kulkarni. 
The police tracked the call centre’s number and traced the accused to Dharavi based on the IP address from where he had uploaded the advertisement.

At Freewayâs start, a boom in vertical slums alters Chembur  Kala Suresh and Parveen Nisa live in neighboring apartment complexes at the northern end of Mumbaiâs newest marvel, the Eastern Freeway.  But their lives couldn't be more different. 
Suresh lives in a gated high-rise next to the middle-class colony of Indian Oil Nagar on the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road.  Across the road, Nisa lives with her family in a 200 sqft tenement in the Natwarlal Parekh slum rehabilitation complex, where she copes with erratic water supply and risky living conditions.  âAfter bringing us here, the authorities left us to deal with overflowing gutters and thieves roaming freely,â she says. 
Once considered far-flung and polluted, the eastern suburbs are set to boom in the next few years thanks to the new connectivity provided by the Monorail and Freeway.  Land prices in Chembur have been rising sharply and old buildings are making way for new.  But in adjacent Govandi and Mankhurd, an equally dramatic housing development has taken place quietly: a stack of low-income complexes have risen on old factory lands in one of the worldâs largest slum resettlement efforts. 
More than 100,000 people have been transplanted here over the past ten years, cleared off pavements, railway tracks and plots of land in the rest of the city to make way for road and rail projects.  At least half of them were moved here before 2011, contributing a chunk of the 2.6 lakh people added to this municipal ward between 2001-2011. 
Mass rehabilitation has enabled infrastructure development in Mumbai.  But the effect on the lives of the slumdwellers and on their new neighborhood has been less positive.  The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, which resettled the slum-dwellers, didnât upgrade the public infrastructure in the Govandi-Mankhurd area to cope with the influx.  The result: a strain on basic facilities in one of Mumbaiâs most underdeveloped areas, an uptick in unemployment and crime, and rising tension between old and new residents. 
Choked infrastructure
The strain is evident at Nisaâs Natwarlal complex.  Resettlement has given slum-dwellers a new, legal home but little else.  âWe have a pucca toilet and my children can bring their friends home now without feeling ashamed,â says Nisa, who moved here from a pavement in Sewri.  âBut what do I do if I canât find a job here or send my children to good schools nearby?â
The local municipal school is overcrowded so Nisaâs two sons go to private schools in Chembur.  M East Ward, in which Govandi and parts of Chembur fall, needs 191 schools but only has 56, according to a report by non-governmental groups. 
Public health services are also overwhelmed.  Another resident, Kantha Nadar, continues to take her ailing husband to KEM Hospital near her old Byculla shanty.  On average, a health facility in Mumbai serves 9,696 people.  But in M East Ward, one health facility serves 27,438 people. 
âThey could meet their basic needs even if they were staying on a footpath in Byculla, as they had good hospitals and schools nearby,â admits Kiran Dighavkar, the assistant municipal commissioner of the ward.  âThat is not the case here, they could have planned it better. â
Some of the displaced slum-dwellers have found work in Chembur shops or the Vashi markets.  Others like Nadar travel to their old jobs and some have even sold their homes and moved back.  A Tata Institute of Social Sciences study showed that in one resettlement complex, 446 of 3,634 tenements had been rented out and 29 sold. 
Many here are also unemployed, however.  In the complexes, thereâs talk of a drug problem, sex work, and a fake documents racket.  âWe tell rickshawallahs that we want to go to Govandi municipal colony.  Otherwise they refuse because our area is notorious,â says Sachin Lubana, a resident of the Lallubhai resettlement complex.  Sangramsinh Nishamdar, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 6, admits that petty crime has risen but denies the presence of organised gangs. 
Reluctant neighbours
When people are displaced suddenly, they lose the community structure that ensures social control, says Leena Joshi, director of TISSâs M-Ward Initiative.  Agrees civic activist and Chembur resident Rajkumar Sharma, âIf you uproot pavement and slum people and put them in a far off placeâ¦ their livelihood is finished, some of them will get into wrong ways of making money. â He blames the government for focusing only on the western suburbs. 
The problem is aggravated by the increasingly segregated living conditions in the city, Joshi adds.  âEarlier, neighbourhoods used to have mixed environments,â Joshi says.  That allowed middle-class colonies and slum areas to develop a symbiotic relationship.  âNow towers are coming up in the old middle-class areas and everyone shops at malls. â
In Govandi, insecurity has stoked the distrust between sudden neighbours.  The women in the slum rehabilitation complexes canât find domestic work in the Indian Oil Colony - middle-class families like Sureshâs prefer to hire help from Shivaji Nagar, an old slum settlement further down the road.  Suresh, whose building has added CCTVs to every floor, blames the new complexes for incidents of chain-snatching and pickpocketing - and for lowering Govandiâs real estate value.  âPrices in other parts of Chembur have gone up four times but here it has only doubled,â she says. 
In turn, Nisa and her neighbours at Natwarlal claim their complexes are targets for miscreants from Shivaji Nagar.  At a recent womenâs group meeting in their building, a young man snatches a phone kept near the door and escapes - despite the presence of a police chowkie in the compound.  âEven after seven years, I still donât feel at home here,â says Nisa.

New AC buses connect south Mumbai to Thane via freeway  MUMBAI: BEST will not only increase bus fares from Sunday, but also modify several routes to cater to commutersâ needs.  On public demand, BEST will resume AC bus services connecting SoBo to Thane via the Eastern Freeway.  The buses will cater to office-goers during morning and evening peak hours and could cut the commute to Fort/Colaba/Nariman Point to just an hour. 
The undertaking also plans to float tenders to procure 299 new red buses for Mumbai, besides installing more LCD screens, adding new seats with better leg space and installing âweather resistantâ electronic route indicators in 800 buses. 
âWe are making all efforts to increase passenger comfort and safety in buses.  Since they will pay more from February 1, we are reciprocating by improving services,â said a senior official on Friday.  He said BEST may not get buses under JNNURM.  âBut we canât wait and are floating tenders to procure new buses by March-April.  This should be possible before we hike fares again on April 1 (by a rupee),â he stated. 
As for the new routes, there will be two via Expresswayâconnecting Backbay depot to Hiranandani Estate and Lodha Paradise respectively in Thane.  Another new route catering to office-goers for SEEPZ will have 24 trips in morning/evening hours from Mulund check-naka to Majas depot. 
Complaints about defective route indicators may be a thing of the past.  BEST recently conducted a pilot project on âweather resistantâ electronic indicators and they will now be affixed on 800 JNNURM buses and all 282 AC buses. 
Sources said there were also plans to have more LCD screens and provide in-bus entertainment.  The TV screens will also be used to create awareness and display helplines of BEST and the police.  Another plan was to install 1,400 new CCTVs as part of security measures for passengers, especially women.  BEST has also taken cognizance of complaints about poor, broken and missing seats.  âWe will replace all bad seats with new ones so that passengers paying more fares have no reason to complain,â said an official. 
The operations department of BEST also plans to increase frequency of buses on busy routes, along CST-Sion and Churchgate-Mahim corridors and explore the possibility of adding new routes on the Santa Cruz-Chembur Link Road.  Sources said there were also plans to introduce feeder routes along the Metro corridor and midi-buses on narrow lanes/hilly stretches in the distant suburbs.

Minor abducted, raped and dropped back home  MUMBAI: A four-year-old girl was kidnapped from outside her fifth-floor flat at a Mhada building near the Wadala Truck Terminus, sexually assaulted and then dropped back on Saturday. 
The incident occurred around 10.30pm while the girl was playing outside her house.  The accused abducted her and took her to the Eastern Freeway.  After sexually assaulting her, he dropped her back at the building’s ground floor, said the police.  The girl’s mother who had been looking for her found her lying injured at the ground floor.  She lodged a complaint on Sunday morning. 
“Based on accounts of eye-witnesses, a sketch has been prepared,” said additional commissioner (central region) RD Shinde.  “A shopowner in the neighbourhood had seen the accused as the latter had visited his store to buy an ice-cream, minutes before the abduction.  The accused may have lured the girl with the ice-cream,” said the police. 
At the time of going to press, the police were combing the area in and around the Mhada Colony in Wadala TT.  The police have registered a case against an unidentified man under Indian Penal Code sections for rape and kidnap.  The accused has also been charged under the POCSO Act.

Property rates rose by 7% in 2014, 0.3% in 2013  MUMBAI: Residential property prices in Mumbai increased by only 7% last year and a negligible 0.3% in 2013, said a report released on Monday. 
The eastern suburbs from Kurla to Mulund saw an increase of 6% in 2014 and 5% in 2013 as land was still available to launch new projects.  South Mumbai and the western suburbs between Malad and Borivli recorded similar increases.  Bandra, Khar, Santacruz and Juhu also saw average price growths, as these areas lack a good supply of high-rises.  Rates in areas like Thane and Navi Mumbai did not rise much either; the uncertainty surrounding the proposed Navi Mumbai airport did not work in favour of the satellite city, said the report by Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL) India. 
Chembur and Wadala stood apart from the lacklustre trend in residential price growth.  “The two suburbs saw a tremendous price increase of 58% and 50% in 2014 over 2013, thanks to completion of infrastructure projects like the Eastern Freeway, which connects Chembur to south Mumbai, and the monorail, which was in the news recently for all the wrong reasons,” it said. 
The report said even the average hike of 7% was primarily due to the development control (DC) rules that came into effect from 2013.  Developers had to start paying for additional (fungible) FSI towards construction of lifts, lobbies, flower beds, balconies, etc, which had been FSI-free areas earlier.  Other reasons for the increase in per-square-ft prices include the rise in ready reckoner rates and escalations in the cost of labour and raw materials. 
“Home prices in the financial capital are evidently not submitting to inflation, which is affecting cost of living in most other respects.  Of course, given the sluggish demand for homes owing to already crippling prices, there is not much scope for appreciation,” said Ramesh Nair, COO, business & international director, JLL India. 
The meagre increase in average property prices in the city stands in stark contrast to the general inflation rate of 6% in 2014 and 9% in 2013 (as per CPI data).  “These figures definitely put paid to the popular perception that Mumbai’s developers keep increasing prices despite the fact that inventory has been building up and housing demand slowing down over the last couple of years,” said Nair.

Eastern Freeway to be extended till Mint Rd, Harbour line to shift  MUMBAI: The 17-km Eastern Freeway will be extended up to the Mint Road junction in South Mumbai.  The Freeway currently ends at Orange Gate on P D’Mello Road.  The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority plans to build a 1.5-km extension by way of a new flyover right up to Mint Road. 
The Freeway has helped decongest Dr Ambedkar Marg, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg, Port Trust Road and Eastern Express Highway as it offers faster connectivity between Ghatkopar and CST, with exits at the Panjrapole Junction, Bhakti Park and Mysore Colony. 
A senior MMRDA official said, “It will help reduce congestion on chock-a-block P D’Mello Road, which narrows down near Orange Gate due to the north-bound ramps of the Freeway. ”
The plan to extend the Freeway was mooted by the Mumbai Port Trust, which agreed to relocate encroachments, if any. 
He said, “We have told the Freeway consultants to examine the proposal, including cost and number of lanes possible. ”
The extension may be two- or four-lane depending on space availability.  A two-lane flyover may cost Rs 40 crore, while the four-lane one may be double that. 
The Freeway was originally planned from Prince of Wales Museum but the plan was aborted to due to lack of space.  The first stretch from Orange Gate to Anik (9.29 km) was built as an elevated corridor, and then till Shivaji Chowk in Chembur (4.3 km) at ground level.  The third and final Panjrapol-Ghatkopar leg is at a height of 22 metres, making it the tallest bridge point in Mumbai. 
Meanwhile, Central Railway has proposed to shift the Harbour line from the west of CST to the east, along P D’Mello Road. 
The elevated line will originate from CST’s platform No 18 and connect Dockyard Road.  The freed up Harbour line can be used as the fifth and sixth lines for main line traffic. 
A Central Railway official said, “We are working out an arrangement where pillars for the Freeway extension can be use for laying of elevated tracks. ”
Commuters using the corridor will be provided a link to the main line stations and Sandhurst Road at Masjid and Sandhurst Road with skywalks.  Meanwhile, the Empowered Committee on Mumbai Transformation has suggested connecting the Freeway to Girgaum Chowpathy via S V Patel Road and Cowasji Road. 
The elevated road will have to be built above the railway tracks and JJ flyover, and will be a crucial east-west connection.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  CST-Panvel corridor plan may have to be reworked  MUMBAI: The CST-Panvel high-speed corridor plans will have to be revised as the Eastern Freeway may be extended and the Harbour line corridor may be shifted along P D’Mello Road to accommodate extension of the fifth and sixth lines for the Main line corridor on Central Railway (CR). 
CR plans to divert the Harbour line from Dockyard to the east of CST, adjacent to P’DMello Road, as land acquisition will be a problem between CST and Currey Road.  The Harbour line corridor at CST and Masjid will be merged with the fifth and sixth lines proposed between CST and Kurla.  The fifth and sixth lines exist between Kurla-Thane. 
The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) plans to extend the Freeway by 1.5km to decongest P D’Mello Road.  A senior Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC) official said, “The high-speed corridor was planned along P D’Mello Road.  If MMRDA extends the Freeway and the Harbour line is shifted, we will have to rework the alignment of the corridor in South Mumbai. ”
MRVC said they could bring the corridor through Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) land.  The official said, “MbPT has to be on board to get the corridor right up to CST.  We could also build the corridor along Mansion Road, parallel to P D’Mello Road. ”
Unlike the Western Railway (WR) elevated corridor, where land acquisition could have been a problem, private land does not have to be acquired on the entire 49km CST-Panvel stretch.  Unlike WR, where a portion of the corridor has to go underground, the Harbour line project will be elevated up to Kurla, and will be at the ground level from Mankhurd. 
The government land mostly belongs to MbPT.  Some slums, mainly in Mankhurd and Govandi, are illegal and rehabilitation will be a major problem.

Now, shipping ministry wants Rs 448 crore to part with land for Sewri-Nhava link  MUMBAI: The cost of the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) may go up, because the shipping ministry has sought Rs 448 crore as compensation for use of port land for the project.  While the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) will have to part with 24 hectares, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) will have to hand over 2 hectares of land for the construction.  Of these, only 13 hectares will be used on a permanent basis for the project. 
An official of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) said the shipping ministry had levied a rate in accordance with its land policy, which stipulates that the amount is to be fixed on the basis of the ready reckoner rates in areas closest to the port land to be used for a project. 
The official said shipping ministry has also decided to charge money wherever construction will be carried out mid-sea within the boundary of the JNPT and MbPT. 
“We have asked the state to request the shipping ministry to give the land at a concessional rate,” the official said. 
A senior MMRDA official said the rates decided by the shipping ministry were too high despite the public purpose behind the project. 
“The shipping ministry has communicated that we will have to shell out Rs 448 crore for this land as per the land use policy,” the official said.  “This figure does not include another Rs 400 crore that the shipping ministry has sought as lease charges for a period of 90 years to be paid in parts annually. ”
The official said the project cost will increase now as the new amount was not factored in when finalizing the estimates. 
The MBPT had leased out land to the MMRDA at a token rate of Re 1 for the construction of the 17-km Eastern Freeway (EFW). 
“We don’t expect the shipping ministry to charge as low as it did for the EFW,” a state official said.  “Still, concessional rates should be considered in the interests of the city. ”
The MMRDA official said the project would not face hurdles because of the cost decided by the shipping ministry.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Mumbai's Ghatkopar busiest Metro station with 41 lakh footfalls per month  MUMBAI: A year after the Metro I was opened for commuters, Ghatkopar has emerged as the busiest station on the 11.4km Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar corridor with around 41 footfalls/month, followed by Andheri with 31 lakh footfalls. 
Ghatkopar and Andheri Metro stations provide interconnectivity with Central Railway and Western Railway suburban networks respectively.  âAs a norm, the originating station has the highest footfall.  Ghatkopar will top the list as it is interlinks with CR suburban services,â said official of Mumbai Metro One Private Ltd. 
Sakinaka and Marol stations were third and fourth on the list with monthly footfalls of 14 lakh and 10 lakh respectively.  Both these locations are home to many business houses. 
In the pre-Mumbai Metro days, BEST bus number 340, which plies between Ghatkopar station (W) and Andheri station (E) was the most profitable route.  But after Metro I was opened on June 8, 2014, most bus commuters changed loyalties.  BEST bus no 340 is no longer profitable though it recouped some of the losses after Metro fares were revised in October 2014. 
CR, too, attributed loss of passengers to Mumbai Metro.  âIn 2013, 45,000 season tickets were sold a day.  Now, 42,000 are sold a day as people prefer travelling by the Metro or the Eastern Freeway,â said a CR official. 
âEarlier, I used to travel to Sakinaka by BEST bus 332.  Now, I board a train to Ghatkopar and then take the Metro, which is quicker and more comfortable,â said Ajay Shahu, who lives in Kurla.  Rahi Jadhav from Vikhroli said, âI used to take an auto to Marol, which cost around Rs 300 (both ways) a day.

Drunk woman lawyer rams Audi into cab on Eastern Freeway, kills 2  MUMBAI: An Audi driven at speed on the wrong side by a drunk woman hit a taxi headlong on the Eastern Freeway in the early hours of Tuesday.  So severe was the impact that the fire brigade had to be called to cut through mangled steel to pull out the taxiâs driver.  He and his front seat passenger didnât survive.  His three back seat passengers are in hospital with fractures and other injuries. 
The woman, Janhavi Ajit Gadkar (35), works in the legal cell of a top corporation at Nariman Point.  The deceased are taxi driver Hussain Sayyed (57) and soap trader Haji Salim Sabuwala (50).  The injured are Sabuwalaâs wife Hafeeza (45), daughter Sabiya (22) and son Noman (18). 
An RTO officer who examined the accident site and the vehicles involved said that looking at the impact, it seemed that both vehicles were at high speed, with the Audi clocking at least 120kmph.  He said Janhavi escaped injuries or death because of her carâs airbags. 
Around 7pm on Monday, Janhavi left her office with two colleagues for Hotel Marine Plaza, where she drank whisky.  They parted three hours later, but Janhavi spent time in her Audi Q3 on Marine Drive till around 12.30am. 
Then she started driving towards her Chembur flat, which is in an upmarket building near RK Studios.  She took P DâMello Road and then the Freeway, driving on the wrong side.  Half a kilometre before Panjarpol tunnel, near Shivaji Nagar Masjid, she grazed two cars before colliding with the taxi.  The accident occurred between 1.10 and 1.20am. 
The Sabuwalas, who live in Null Bazar, Nagpada, were returning from an eatery in Bhiwandi, where they had gone to celebrate son Nauman's success in the SSC exams. 
An eyewitness of the accident, who gave his name as Hassan, said, âI was returning with my family when the incident occurred.  I immediately got hold of the woman and called the RCF police.  Passers-by removed the injured taxi passengers and took them to Sion hospital.  We also called the fire brigade to free the driver.  Janhavi tried to hush up the matter by offering payment to the victims on the spot and telling us not to call the police. â
Dilip Raut of the RCF police said Janhavi was so drunk that she could barely stand.  âWe immediately sent her for medical tests.  The reports are awaited. â
Janhavi has been arrested under several sections of the IPC and the Motor Vehicle Act, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving.  If convicted, she may get a maximum of ten years of rigorous imprisonment.  She has been remanded in police custody till Wednesday. 
Assistant commissioner of police Jeevaji Jadhav said, âThe road was almost empty.  Janhavi, driving under the influence of alcohol, did not realize her direction was wrong.  She entered the Freeway on the wrong side at its mouth at Masjid Bunder. â
Joint commissioner (law and order) Deven Bharti said the police have strong evidence and witnesses to prove the case against Janhavi.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Faced with the grim situation, the Gadkars are trying to field a strong team of defence lawyers.  They have approached senior counsel Amit Desai and Aabad Ponda, sources said.  Earlier on Wednesday, advocate Mahesh Sabnis appeared for her in the Kurla metropolitan magistrateâs court but failed to take her out of police custody.  Janhaviâs police remand was extended till Friday.  The Reliance executive can seek bail only after she is sent to judicial custody.  On the other hand, the police can seek her custody for two weeks to a month.  Janhavi,35, has been arrested by RCF police after she slammed into a taxi and killed two persons while driving down the wrong lane of the Eastern Freeway in the early hours of Tuesday.  Her trial can easily be fast-tracked since sheâs already in custody and the police have recorded the statements of the witnesses, said lawyers.  Once Janhaviâs blood alcohol test result and the victimsâ statements are ready, the chargesheet can be filed within two weeks.  The deadline is 90 days, but the police can speed things up, said advocate Shrikant Bhat.  After the chargesheet, the case can go trial in a sessions court after framing of charges.  âItâs an incident thatâs unfortunate but an offence that is not to be taken lightly,ââ said advocate Niteen Pradhan, adding that fast-tracking the trial is necessary so that justice is not delayed in such cases that have been increasing.  Victims usually get a raw deal with such cases dragging on without any compensation.  But the trial court can keep in mind a landmark judgment last November by the Supreme Court that said victims in a criminal case have a right to interim compensation ordered suo motu by court.  Lawyer Hitesh Jain felt the case needs to be turned into an example because âas lawyers, there is a greater sense of responsibility to conduct ourselves and behave within the limits of lawâ.  Janhavi, described by her friends as âfun-loving, likable, popular and admiredââ, was dubbed âAudi killerââ by the twitterati on Wednesday.  âJanhavi Gadkar the Audi killer must be severely punished by law,â tweeted Purushottam@brahmajnana2015.  Her former colleague, Feroze Dubash, partner of Talwar Thakore & Associates where she was a managing associate between 2007 and 2013, declined comment.  Ashok Malkani, an anguished citizen, said the tragic incident âbrought to light the high-powered lives led by corporate executives.  What is devastating is that her drinking partners, despite seeing that she had no driver, let her drive off aloneâ.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Now, nakabandis on all 7 days, plan for new speed limits on key roads  MUMBAI: Anti-drunk driving nakabandis will now be conducted everyday by the traffic police, in the wake of Tuesdayâs mishap where a lawyer crashed her Audi into a cab, killing two people.  The traffic police also intend to approach various agencies and reconfigure speed limits on key stretches to make them more realistic.  Besides Tuesdayâs victims, one person was killed and 23 others were injured in mishaps caused solely due to drunk driving since January this year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interestingly, the traffic department had proposed 12 cameras for the Eastern Freeway but they are yet to get a green signal.  Of the 12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
âAnti drunk-driving nakabandis were conducted on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays so far.  This was based on the presumption that people head to watering holes as weekends come closer.  But with Tuesdayâs mishap, the department will rent 300 hoardings and put up additional VMS boards across the city for displaying messages to create awareness. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The traffic department has also put together a list of key roads and junctions where police presence will be increased.  Officials believe this will act as a deterrent to offenders. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
âThe speed limits on certain stretches are not realistic.  For instance, the speed limit on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link is 50kmph, Western and Eastern Express Highways, Marine Drive, Eastern Freeway etc. , and reconfigure speed limits.  Where motorists are found flouting the reconfigured speed limits, strict action would be taken,â said the official.  Incidentally in 2009, the authorities had halved the speed limit on the Sea Link from 100 kmph to 50 kmph, fearing that there would be accidents. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Between January 1 to June 9 this year, 6856 motorists were booked for drunk driving and Rs 1.41 crore was collected in fines by the traffic police.  2370 motorists were handed out prison sentences and driving licences of 1265 motorists were suspended by courts.  Two-wheeler riders were the biggest culprits; they comprised 63% of total offenders booked.  Maximum offenders caught (28%) were aged between 26 and 30 years.

'Father never had a mishap in 32 years’  MUMBAI: At the second floor chawl near the crowded Patel Musafir Khana on Wednesday evening, the taxi driver who died in Tuesday’s mishap on the Eastern Freeway, appeared very angry and restless.

Drunk Mumbai lawyer got confused near home, started on the wrong way from Chembur  MUMBAI: On the night of her drunken rampage, corporate lawyer Janhavi Gadkar did not get on the wrong lane of the Eastern Freeway from P D’Mello Road itself, believe the police.  Spurred by accounts of two witnesses, the RCF police, investigating the case, are on the verge of concluding that a sozzled Janhavi drove down the length of the Freeway from south Mumbai down the correct carriageway, exited at Chembur but got confused at the seven-point Shivaji Chowk circle near her house and drove back up on the south-bound carriageway.  After crossing the Panjarpol tunnel, she realized she was going the wrong way and took an illegal and extremely dangerous U-turn on that carriageway and started driving north towards Chembur against the traffic.  She scraped two Swifts and collided with the taxi, killing two persons.  READ ALSO: Lawyer had 4 times more alcohol than permissible level, report saysDrunk woman lawyer rams Audi into cab on Eastern Freeway, kills 2 The police are studying CCTV footage from four cameras — two at P D’Mello Road, and one each at Shivaji Chowk and Panjarpol naka — to finalize the route Janhavi took.

Fewer night checks on women drivers  A number of the big drunk-driving crashes that turned fatal on Mumbaiâs streets since the 2006 Alistair Pereira case, it turns out, have involved women.  Legal experts and analysts alike believe thereâs a reason for this.  The most important is the reality on the ground: Mumbai cops do not have enough breath analysers or enough women to patrol the streets at night in order to get as close as possible to women drivers to detect whether they are smelling of alcohol. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nakabandis, which police have in place on a regular basis at night, often do so secure in the thought that cops rarely stop and sniff at a woman driverâs breath.  âAm never stopped by the police,â said a woman who lives at Walkeshwar.  âBut then I never drink beyond a glass of wine or a beer, in any case,â she added quickly, unwilling to let her name be used.  âEspecially if a dupatta is thrown over the shoulders, cops believe that women are still not likely to drive in a drunken state,â said another woman executive who did not wish to be identified. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Counsellors and sociologists say lack of nakabandi checks on women behind the wheel embolden many to not think twice before driving under influence of alcohol. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The slack enforcement of law, due to manpower crunch or pure faith in womenâs law-abiding nature, were women.  At the entrance to the Eastern Freeway from south Mumbai, the same one that accused law executive Janhavi Gadkar took before she killed two persons by crashing her Audi, there is a nakabandi every night, but for women itâs a green channel.  The Nooriya Haveliwala case of 2010 and the Aarti Shetty case of 2012 are other standout cases of women being involved in drunk driving cases that turned fatal.  Psychiatrist Harish Shetty says, âGenders are truly coming close as similar behaviour is seen across cross-sections. â,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Independence and gender neutrality at workplaces have led to more women drinking socially, said Anjali Chhabria,â concern from a friend is expected âespecially when it is clear that a woman is unable to think or drive carefully. â,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chhabria said alcohol disinhibits a person, makes a person more reckless, and also gives a person a false sense of confidence. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corporate lawyer Swapnil Kothari said, âThe key decision of not getting behind the wheel (after getting drunk) should prevail over everything else. â,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kothari added, âThe head of the Traffic Injury Research Foundation, and certain trends came to the fore â among them, that young women were drinking because other people were, and that some women had started drinking after the birth of their children. â TIMES VIEW: This incident shows the time has come for a stricter crackdown on the menace of driving after drinking.  Cops should revisit the time when they first started the crackdown in Mumbai and personnel on the ground should be equipped with an adequate number of breath analysers to ensure the system is fair and does not end in harassment of the law-abiding motorist.  It should also be emphasised to the cop on the street that corruption and boorish behaviour with motorists can end up defeating the purpose of such campaigns.

Lawyer who killed 2 in mishap out of police custody, seeks bail  MUMBAI: A day after it emerged that the alcohol content in Janhavi Gadkarâs blood was four times the allowed limit, to judicial custody. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The remand prompted an immediate plea for bail, which will be heard on Monday after Janhavi spends three nights in Byculla womenâs prison, where police do not have access to her for interrogation or their probe.  Police custody, on the other hand, allows the cops to interrogate an accused or take him/her again to the crime scene. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her bail plea, TOI found out, it focuses on her need to get proper treatment for her âvisibleââ injuries to her âswollenââ hand and how she will not abscond or tamper with evidence once released. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metropolitan magistrate Richa Khedekar of the Kurla court rapped the cops for making only an âoral pleaâ for Janhaviâs continued custody on grounds of further investigation and also reprimanded them for not making a diary entry of the probe, as required in law.  RCF police inspector Sunil Kamble said in court the entry was not made since they were busy with evidence collection. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But after hearing both sides, the magistrate quietly announced her decision to reject the police plea for two more daysâ custody,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Janhaviâs lawyer Mahesh Sabnis later said Janhaviâs family had expressed regret (over the incident).  âI spoke to her family and they have expressed regret over what happened.  They are willing to take care of the victimsâ medical expenses just as they would for Janhavi,â he told reporters. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police probe, however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sabnis had pleaded that no further police custody be granted and that it should only be judicial custody, since her custodial interrogation is no longer required for any further investigation which the cops may be doing.  Sabnis said Janhavi had cooperated all along and had returned to the police station at 8 am after she was left on a bond on the night of the incident and not arrested that night since she was a woman.  âShe returned on June 9 at 8 am as a respectable citizen to help the police probe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The defence again focused on the health aspect and wanted her out of the police lock-up to enforce her right to get proper treatment.  Sabnis said it was not as if she wasnât getting medical treatment in police custody, but she needed proper attention.  He also said the police must continue to carry out their probe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, the hearing, and in court wore slippers and kept crying and hiding her face in a kerchief and the dupatta, as she has been doing in the lock-up too, said sources.  Her mother, a former senior legal manager at BEST, was in court on Friday and appeared in charge of things.  She declined to comment when TOI approached her, before leaving the court premises from a side entrance, avoiding the photographers and cameras.  Janhaviâs estranged husband, Rahul Sarela, was also present. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The policeâs argument was that Janhavi was so intoxicated that she did not remember where she took the wrong lane on the Freeway.  âIf she was intoxicated, how could she tell them?

Lack of signs on roads worries traffic experts  MUMBAI: Sunday’s mishap on JJ flyover should not be treated as a one-off incident", say experts, who are worried about the sharp turn where it occurred.  Accidents are waiting to happen at this place and any untrained driver, who also speeds, is at high risk of losing control, they say. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Experts say speeds above 30 kmph at the bend can be a problem and want cops to launch an awareness campaign, targeting northbound motorists at the southern approach of the flyover.  Experts want the police to keep an eye on bikers as well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“On accident-prone areas, signboards warning of mishaps should be present.  These markings are significant and are present on most national highways.  But in cities,” said transport expert Jitendra Gupta.  “A regular driver might be aware of such sharp turns, but for a new driver they may pop up as surprises.  Therefore, whenever there are roads with sharp turns, all nuisance (like hoardings or billboards) should be done away with. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rishi Agarwal, a research fellow at Observer Research Foundation (ORF), who lost control of her vehicle and hit a taxi headlong) was driving at was too high for a sharp turn.  People feel if there’s an empty stretch on a flyover, speed limits do not apply.  If the highway engineer has mentioned that you need to drive under a certain limit, drivers should follow it. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To slow down motorists on flyovers and highways in the city, the traffic police have recommended the BMC to get speed guns.  The project can be undertaken in phases.  The speed limit on JJ flyover is 40 kmph.  Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Milind Bharambe said, JJ flyover, sea link, and Eastern and Western Express Highways. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He said, “It may be recollected that recently the BMC installed eight CCTV cameras at key points of the Eastern Freeway.  Each of these cameras provide a 360° view of its vicinity.  Footage from all eight can be monitored real-time on a single screen with eight frames.  Each frame can be enlarged at any time to view footage in magnification. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will prepare detailed project report for an elevated east-west corridor that will link P D’Mello Road, near the Eastern Freeway, to Girgaum Chowpatty.  The 4km link is proposed over Sardar Vallabhai Patel (SVP) Road and will cross the JJ flyover.  It is expected to reduce travel time from around 40 minutes to 10 minutes via Fort and Marine Drive.  The proposed link will provide integration with the coastal road, that is being planned between Kandivli and Nariman Point.  An MMRDA official said, “We will appoint an agency to prepare the report in two months.  The agency may take six months to prepare the report. ” The estimated cost of the project is likely to be less than Rs 300 crore for the 2+2 lane road.  The official said, “It will be a challenging project due to paucity of space on the narrow stretch of SVP Road.  The agency will have to identify hurdles and challenges for execution of the project in this part of the city, where land acquisition is an expensive and tedious process.  Besides, there will be a complicated maze of utilities from the British era. ” Also, work will have to be carried out above Central Railway and Western Railway tracks.  He said there were also environmental hurdles too as the western arm of the flyover will emerge very close to Girgaum, where coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) regulations are in place.  MMRDA has already formalized plans for another east-west connector in south Mumbai between Sewri-Worli.  The project will begin at Narayan Hardikar Marg in Worli and meet the planned Mumbai Trans Harbour Link at its Sewri interchange, near Sewri railway station.  He said, “The report will help provide us the estimated costs, challenges and tentative time required to execute the project. ”Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Drunk driving accused Janhavi Gadkar loses her licence  Mumbai: Corporate lawyer Janhavi Gadkar, accused of ramming her SUV into a taxi while driving drunk on the wrong lane of the Eastern Freeway and killing two on June 10, may not be able to drive again as the Wadala RTO revoked her driving licence on Wednesday. Regional transport officer (eastern suburbs) B I Ajri said Gadkar, who has spent 58 days in custody, was issued a showcause notice at her Chembur residence, asking why her licence should not be revoked.  Unimpressed with Gadkar’s defence, the RTO cancelled her licence. Gadkar can appeal against the order before transport commissioner Sonia Sethi. “We want to give a stern message to citizens that howsoever you are placed in society, we will cancel your licence permanently if you violate the road safety laws,” said Ajri.  “By revoking her licence, we have created a major deterrent for others. ”In her reply to the notice, Ajri said Gadkar pointed out she had not been involved in any tr-affic offence in the past.  Moreover, there was no conclusive evidence against her in the case, and since the matter is sub judice, cancellation of licence could have an impact on the court case. “But after going through the police FIR and conducting our inquiries, I came to the conclusion that it was justified to revoke her licence for drunk driving.  She is an advocate who knew the law very well; and it was callous on her part to drink and drive as it posed a major threat to road safety,” said Ajri.  The RTO had conducted its own investigation in the case and collected relevant documents from the police. “Revoking of licence is a drastic step as in most cases of drunk driving, the licence is suspended and the accused is sent for a refresher course at the RTO.  But the extreme step has been taken in view of the seriousness of this case,” said another senior transport official. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Rain, thunder on Saturday wipe sweat off city’s brow  Mumbai: Heavy rain and lightning was witnessed in several parts of Mumbai on Saturday evening.  Weather officials said that withdrawal symptoms of the monsoon coupled with a lot of cloudiness and moisture resulted in the showers.  The IMD has has forecast that frequent spells of rain accompanied with thunder showers will occur towards evening or night in the next 24 hours.  The rainfall recorded for a period of 12 hours from 8.30 am to 8.30 pm on Saturday in Colaba was 25.8 mm and while it was 8 mm in Santacruz.  Heavy rain showers in the city area and suburbs brought down maximum temperatures which almost touched 37.4 degrees last week.  The maximum temperature recorded at Colaba and Santacruz on Saturday was the same, 31.8 degrees Celsius.  The relative humidity recorded in Colaba was 75% and in Santacruz, it was 74%.  “The intensity of clouds over Mumbai is good which caused lighting.  There is a lot of cloudiness along the west coast over the land.  This is a typical withdrawal phenomenon when lightning and thunder showers are at the peak.  The monsoon withdrawal line has reached Porbunder and Bhavnagar in Gujarat and will take a fortnight before it reaches Maharashtra,” K S Hosalikar, deputy director-general (western region) India Meteorological Department told TOI.  Other parts of the state like Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli witnessed heavy rainfall as well.  King’s Circle resident Nikhil Desai that the heavy rains and loud thunder showers which Mumbai witnessed were like monsoon announcing its departure.  “There was some flooding in Gandhi Market area.  The rains however cooled the weather drastically,” said Desai.  There was flooding near Panjrapole tunnel towards north on the Eastern Freeway.  BEST bus traffic was closed at Hindmata from 8 pm and vehicles diverted. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Can smaller sample affect Janhavi case?  MUMBAI: Would drawing blood less than what the law stipulates for testing alcohol content be fatal to a case where lives were lost in what doesn’t amount to murder but is a culpable homicide? The answer may be in the negative, as is what happened when a trial judge in 2012 held a US national Nooriya Haveliwala guilty and sentenced her to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for mowing down, in a drunken state, two persons in 2010.  The police had drawn a blood sample less than the minimum 5ml prescribed by law and based on that sample she was found to be highly intoxicated.  The chargesheet in a more recent case, that of legal executive Janhavi Gadkar who after speeding at around 120 kmph in the wrong direction in her AudiQ3 on the Eastern Freeway late at night allegedly highly drunk, crashed head on with a cab killing its driver and a passenger in June, say the police similarly drew a sample of 3ml rather than 5ml.  Her lawyers appear excited at this “positive point’’ in her defence.  A “procedural lapse’’ seen by them as a potential glitch, which would mar the forensic lab results.  Gadkar’s blood-alcohol content, the chargesheet said was more than four times the normal level of .03%, an evidence if established that would prove most damning to her case.  Police said Janhavi had consumed at least 2-3 large pegs of whiskey at a Marine Drive hotel before consuming 1 litre of beer soon afterwards at a pub nearby in Kala Ghoda with a senior colleague to whom she described the death of two persons in the collision she had had, as a “small accident”.  Nooriya’s lawyers had raised the issue of procedural lapses in testing her blood alcohol, but the trial court had in its 2012 verdict accepted the test results and held her to be drunk in the January 2010 case where two persons, including a cop had died.  Now, out on bail from Bombay high court, where she has challenged her conviction, her lawyer, Aabad Ponda, is stressing on the “procedural violation”.  In 2013, he had argued that a medical report of the alcohol content in Nooriya’s blood was suspect as proper procedures were not followed.  Among the “lapse” he said was that a smaller blood sample was collected by doctors.  Nooriya’s breath-analyser test had said she had 450 milligrams of alcohol per 100 ml, which was so high that a person could not stand straight let alone drive, Ponda had argued.  Police tests showed an alcohol content of 457mg per 100ml in her blood stream, though the permissible limit is 30mg.  But forensic experts, like Rukmani Krishnamurthy,former director of the directorate of forensic science labs, who is now the chief of Helik Advisory, said breath-analysers can be quite accurate too.  Breath-testing is the most common method used by law enforcement to estimate blood alcohol content (BAC) because breath-analysis devices are lightweight, portable, and provide immediate results.

Goregaon-Mulund Road to have a tunnel  MUMBAI: The BMC has proposed to construct a tunnel as a part of its Rs,1,300 crore Goregaon Mulund Link Road (GMLR).  The revised alignment plan of GMLR was released at the political group leaders meeting held on Friday. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TOI had reported on July 6 that the BMC was considering to build a tunnel through the national park instead of constructing an elevated road to reduce ecological damage. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GMLR is a crucial east-west link designed to reduce traffic congestion.  It will begin from Western Express Highway and end on LBS Marg in Mulund.  The earlier alignment passed close to the reservoir in Bhandup and also affected tree cover.  It also passed through the land allotted for a water treatment plant. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the civic body has now proposed two tunnel alignment options.  According to the first option, which will run from under Vihar Lake located within Borivli national park .  Civic chief Ajoy Mehta said that permission would be sought for soil testing from the environment department. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Earlier this month I visited the site and realized that the earlier alignment proposed might not be feasible and therefore we have proposed a tunnel.  After presenting the proposal for the same to the group leaders in the civic House and mayor Snehal Ambekar we will now be seeking clearence from the environment department,” said Mehta. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The civic body plans to start work on the motorway in the next four months.  SP leader Rais Shaikh has suggested that instead of linking Goregaon and Mulund, the civic corporations should consider connecting Goregoan and Mankhurd.  “This will ensure that the vehicles that come from the Eastern Freeway, on Marine Drive itâs 60kmph  MUMBAI: The maximum speed limit for vehicles on Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Eastern Freeway, Eastern and Western Express Highways, Sion-Panvel Highway, Sion-Chembur Link Road and at Marine Drive has been increased by 20-30kmph from Friday midnight.  âThe speed limit on the sea link has been increased from 50kmph to 80kmph, and at the gate and the curves, vehicles can now drive at a maximum 40kmph, instead of 30kmph,â said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Milind Bharambe.  He added that the speed limit for vehicles on Eastern Freeway, Eastern and Western Express Highways, Sion-Panvel Highway and Sion-Chembur Link Road too has been increased from 50kmph to 80kmph and at Marine Drive, the maximum speed limit will be 60kmph from 40 kmph.

State should appeal against return of driving licence to Gadkar: Experts  MUMBAI: The state should appeal against the order of a sessions judge that gave back the driving licence to corporate legal executive Janhavi Gadkar", said legal experts.  Gadkar is accused of ramming her SUV into a taxi while driving drunk on the wrong lane of the Eastern Freeway and killing two persons in June.  Legal experts said on Saturday that the prosecution ought to first challenge the order of the deputy commissioner of RTO who set aside the revocation of her licence and also the return of the licence, pending a re-decision on revocation before an RTO officer.  “The licence ought not to be returned in its active state till the trial in the case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder is over,” said advocate Pranav Badheka.  The police too said the order should be appealed, as the prosecutor, while opposing her bail plea, had expressed fears that she may repeat the offence.  The RTO had revoked Gadkar’s licence on September 15 after issuing show-case notice and receiving her reply.  But she challenged the revocation before the deputy commissioner of the RTO Satish Sahastrabuddhe who on December 9 sent the matter to the RTO licensing officer for a hearing, after agreeing with her lawyer that there was no personal hearing given to her.  He set aside the revocation and directed that a hearing notice be issued to her.  But before any notice was issued by the RTO licensing officer, the sessions court ordered that her licence be returned on December 15.  However, in law, as even a legal expert pointed out, before an administrative officer, if an opportunity is given for a reply, which is tendered, it is not mandatory to give a personal hearing.  The state can challenge the setting aside of the revocation on this ground, said a lawyer.  Gadkar meanwhile is back at work, at her old office.  Her case was that in other similar cases of fatal crashes, for instance in the case of Nooriya Haveliwala, the RTO had not revoked driving licences.  Lawyers said a condition can be placed on her not to drive again till the trial is complete.  Gadkar had sought her licence back as part of “return of property” pending trial.

Mumbai Metro on track The 33.5-km-long Colaba-Bandra-Seepz Mumbai Metro III is the showpiece project of the Devendra Fadnavis government and intrinsic to the transformation of Mumbai into an International Finance Centre.  Mr Fadnavis had stayed the construction of a car shed at Aarey Milk Colony after environmentalists, and political parties such as the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena objected to the chopping of trees. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An expert committee that surveyed several locations has suggested an alternative land at Kanjurmarg.  However, Ashwini Bhide,000-crore rail project. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have the controversies around the project and complexities bogged you down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, I have handled several projects, just a fraction of this.  But it had more complexities – a mosque had to be shifted, a marble market had to be removed, it was the only East-West connectivity and traffic was high.  But we addressed the problems. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is the status of the Aarey Colony car shed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The expert committee suggested an alternative location at Kanjurmarg for the depot and a smaller plot at Aarey for 16 stabling lines.  The government is yet to take a decision on the report.  The Kanjurmarg plot is government land, but it is under litigation.  If the Kanjurmarg plot is not feasible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will the car shed controversy delay the project?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have completed a lot of paperwork and have to get permissions from various agencies, and departments, revenue, public works department, the BMC, Airport Authority of India, Bureau of Security, the Railway Board and the Mumbai police.  We have acquired 83 per cent of the land required for the project. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are now working on getting the remaining 17 per cent of land from the BMC.  There are 45 land parcels in this 17 per cent, some for temporary use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike previous projects I have undertaken, I have a witnessed a sea change — all the multiple agencies involved in the project are co-operating very well for this project. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What are the challenges of the project, considering you are virtually going to cut open half of Mumbai’s belly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The advantage in Mumbai Metro III is that the tunnel boring machine will work 25 metres below surface.  Utilities like telephone lines, electric cables are in first six metres below surface and will not be disturbed for the entire project by the tunnel work.  However,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So every one kilometre, we will have to cut open a rectangular box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In this project, there would be technological and geological challenges because of tunnelling.  We will be tunnelling through a complete hard rock and because it is hard rock,.  We have anticipated such challenges, and prepared the tender documents. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At what stage is the relief and rehabilitation of the Project Affected People?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight hundred families in Girgaum, Kalbadevi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are ready to give them temporary or even rented accommodation and are working on alternatives.  We are telling people that do not look at this project as threat, but as an opportunity.  I cannot claim a solution has been found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is there a trust deficit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People’s experiences with transit accommodation have not been very good, and that’s why they are apprehensive.  But people have to believe in agencies like MMRDA.  We are talking about smart cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But, whatever road projects we implemen, they are not going to be adequate.  There is no alternative to a metro like mass transit project. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today, we have 75 per cent of the population travelling by public transport, we can undertake such a project.  The more we delay, it will gradually become nearly impossible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the police, the skeleton was hidden in a hollow space in one of the girders supporting the freeway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police said the skeleton was discovered by some labourers on Thursday night while they were working on laying cables in the space. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The body had decomposed with only the skeleton remaining.  But the clothes were still recognisable.  Based on the T-shirt, trousers and threads tied around the wrist and neck,” said senior police inspector Suhas Garud of Wadala TT police. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police said Furkan stayed with his father, a taxi driver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was playing outside his house in Indira Nagar, Wadala on the evening of October 13, they approached the Wadala police and registered a missing person’s complaint. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the skeleton was found on Thursday night, the Wadala TT police sent out a wireless alert seeking information about missing minors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The level of decomposition makes it difficult to discern any assault that might have occurred, and we are awaiting reports of post-mortem examination,” Mr Garud added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police believe the skeleton was kept at the spot where it was found either on Thursday, at the most a day earlier. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officials said that it was highly unlikely that Furkan was killed and his body hidden immediately after the murder, as the stench created by the decomposition would have alerted passersby immediately.  Freeway mishap: lawyer remanded to judicial custody till Jun 26 Corporate lawyer Janhvi Gadkar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The alcohol level in the blood of 35-year-old Gadkar, who had allegedly drove the car allegedly after having drinks from a posh pub in south Mumbai, purportedly shot by a person who passed by the spot when the gruesome accident happened, showed that the woman was unperturbed, asking for her 'dupatta' from people who had gathered at the site. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the early hours of June 10, an Audi driven by Gadkar rammed into a taxi, on the Eastern Freeway here.  She was allegedly drunk at that time. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She had moved the sessions court after Kurla Metropolitan Magistrate Court rejected her bail plea twice. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gadkar, through her lawyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the prosecution had opposed it saying if she was released on bail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police had in their reply earlier said that Gadkar was also involved in accidents prior to the June 10 incident, and she was likely to repeat the offence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police had also said that an earlier accident allegedly committed by her prior to the June 10 incident was settled between the victim and Gadkar and hence, no case was filed against her. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gadkar, through her lawyer Amit Desai had told the Kurla court that the investigation in the case is over and her custody is no longer required. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The senior lawyer had contended that charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder is not attracted in the case but police should have imposed section 185 of Motor Vehicle Act that deals with drunken driving. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Desai also had told the court that the prosecution's claim that she will tamper with evidence or will go absconding does not hold ground as after the accident she was allowed to go back home and the police had called her the next day. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prosecutor Pralahad Mahajan had opposed the bail saying that some of the witnesses are friends of the accused and live in the same vicinity and hence she will tamper with evidence if released on bail. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pangam Bridge,"Malkanagiri receives 317.2 mm rainfall in 48 hours Heavy downpour triggered by depression over Bay of Bengal battered Odisha’s Malkanagiri district paralysing normal life and disrupting road communication badly. 
Malkanagiri recorded 317.2 mm of rainfall during past 48 hours which is enough to flood large parts of seven blocks in the district. 
According to office of Special Relief Commissioner, due to very heavy rainfall, communication to most part of the district was disrupted and flood water overtopped the roads and bridges at many places.  “Some villages especially in Kalimela and Korukonda blocks were marooned.  The telephone and mobile phone service was also partially affected,” the SRC office said. 
Korukonda block town of Malkanagiri, which had received 254 mm on Saturday, recorded 187 mm rainfall on Sunday.  Malkanagiri district headquarter town also recorded precipitation of 206 mm on Sunday. 
Reports from the district said situation improved as the rain stopped since Sunday morning.  “Connectivity on Jeypore and Malkangiri road has been restored as flood water has receded from Pangam Bridge and Saptadhara Bridge.  Similarly, connectivity from Malkangiri to Motu and Balimela has been made motorable.  It will take some more time for restoration of Kalimela-Padia road,” it said. 
Two units of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) from third battalion of Odisha State Armed Police with 16 personnel and required equipment reached Malkangiri to assist the District Administration in search, rescue, road clearance and other relief operation.

Kalan Masjid,"Fifth road rage accused arrested  NEW DELHI: The fifth accused in the Turkman Gate road rage incident, who was evading arrest from the past three days, was finally arrested from the Trans-Yamuna area on Wednesday.  Police said the accused has been identified as Aminuddin alias Amin Pahalwan.  The car involved in the case has been impounded. 
On the day of the incident, Pahalwan (50) was returning with his son Shahdab in their Hyundai i20 from Seelampur after attending a wedding.  When Shehnawaz’s bike brushed against their car, it led to a heated argument.  The five accused then thrashed, kicked and beat up Shehnawaz brutally leading to his death. 
“Twelve teams were formed to arrest the accused.  He was finally caught by a team including inspectors Satinder Mohan (special staff), Yash Veer Singh, Anil Sharma and VN Jha.  We received a tip-off about Amin’s movement and nabbed him from Anand Vihar ISBT.  Amin has more than seven cases lodged against him, including one of rioting,” said Parmaditya, DCP (central). 
During interrogation, it was revealed that Pahalwan had actively provoked his son Shahdab to beat up Shehnawaz.  The other accused, Saleemuddin, started beating the victim after he saw them get into an argument.  Amin confessed that he got angry when the bike touched his car. 
Pahalwan is well-known in the Walled City, but as his name suggests he has never been a wrestler.  He has 22 siblings and all are involved in construction and property dealing businesses since 2010, police said.  Originally from Meerut, Pahalwan stays with his wife, three sons and two daughters.  The family is known as “Kali Duniya Ke Loag” in the Walled City.  A police officer said the family lives near Kalan Masjid.  As in local dialect Kalan becomes Kali, the family is known by this name.

Rabindra Sarovar,"Minors gang-raped in New Alipore flat  KOLKATA: The Bansdroni police on Saturday arrested four youths from New Alipore, Behala and Thakurpukur for allegedly gang-raping two minor girls at a New Alipore flat on Thursday night. 
The accused had promised the girls â students of Class IX â an outing, but took them to the flat in New Alipore instead and raped them all through the night, says the complaint.  The two girls are close friends and study in a well known school. 
According to police, the girls came in contact with the prime accused, 20-year-old Anik Bhattacharya, on a social networking site.  He had allegedly used the âHokkolorobâ platform to befriend them.  Over time, the accused introduced some of his other friends to the girls. 
On Wednesday, Anik asked the girls to meet him and a few of his friends at Rabindra Sarovar on Thursday, say police.  The teenage girls agreed as they knew Anik and his group. 
When the girls didnât return home in time, their family started looking for them but drew a blank.  The families then lodged separate missing personâs complaints with Bansdroni police. 
Police said that after the girls met the accused at Sarovar, the youths executed the âsecond part of the planâ.  Anik allegedly lured the girls to visit his house in the upscale P-block of New Alipore.  Once there, the accused allegedly confined the two minors in a room and took turns to rape them throughout the night. 
According to the FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, the youths allegedly forced the schoolgirls to visit other places with them and clicked objectionable photographs of them.  They threatened to make these photographs public if the girls went to police, says the complaint. 
On Friday morning, the two girls returned home, battered and traumatized.  They stayed silent for most of the day but broke down in the evening and told their parents. 
After a case was registered at Bansdroni police station, the officers worked jointly with their counterparts at New Alipore.  Anik and his friend Avishek Tarafdar, a resident of Behalaâs Banamali Naskar Road, were arrested from Anikâs house on Saturday.  Their questioning led to the arrest of Sanket Ghosh (19) from Narkeldanga.  The cops rounded up a fourth accused, Soumajit Das alias Raj (18), from Thakurpukur. 
âWe have produced them in court.  The accused have been sent to police custody till March 26.  We have charged them with gang rape, criminal conspiracy, being procurator of a minor girl, wrongful confinement, watching a woman in a private act, criminal intimidation and sections 3 and 4 of the stringent POCSO Act that deals with sexual offences committed against minors,â said Santosh Pandey, DC, south suburban. 
Police sources said they have received complaints that the accused may have operated a racket in the garb of a friendship club.  âWe will look into this allegation too,â said an officer.

Calcutta Medical Research Institute launches ICU on-the-go  KOLKATA: The C K Birla Hospitals on Friday rolled out a fleet of ambulances with in-built ICU and facilities for transmission of patient’s vitals on the go, live monitoring via webcam and life-saving equipments and drugs.  Mayor Sovon Chatterjee and police commissioner Surajit Kar Purakayastha flagged off the ambulances at CMRI. 
The ambulances will be stationed at seven locations — Victoria Memorial, Park Circus, Sarat Bose Road, Hazra, Rabindra Sarovar, Howrah and Joka.  On this new fleet, medical care will be administered on the spot by trained paramedics, who will be guided by doctors via live video-streaming.  The live audio-video screening facility will connect the ambulance to the team of emergency care doctors at the hospital, which will also enable the team at the hospital to be prepared for the arriving patient, thereby mitigating any delays in the medical care, said hospital authorities.  The ambulances are also equipped to transmit ECG results and other vital parameters to the medical staff, so treatment for conditions like myocardial infarction and stroke can start on the ambulance itself, they pointed out. 
Chatterjee said: “It’s a big boost to medical facilities in Kolkata.  I’m more excited as five years ago, when I became mayor for the first time, I had an amnesty scheme where we raised some funds.  Now, with the Mamata Banerjee government in power, there are 21 trauma ambulances at various points of the city.  With these seven ambulances, it’s a step forward as they are state-of-the-art and we don’t have the infrastructure to have such advanced facilities in our ambulances. ”
Purakayastha recounted an overseas experience to explain the crucial role of an ambulance in the case of an accident.  “Several years ago, I was in an exchange program in the UK.  While having an interaction with a British cop at Leeds, we witnessed an accident.  When it happens here, we wait for the police to take the victim to hospital.  But there the cops did nothing.  I was surprised.  In less than 90 seconds, the siren of an ambulance was heard.  As soon as the victim was picked up, the police cordoned off the area and started investigating,” said the police commissioner. 
“In the UK, work areas are clearly defined and people are assigned to specific jobs.  That is a sign on developed nation.  Policemen are not trained to handle patients with serious injuries.  Mishandling can put the victim’s life at risk.  Lives lost in accidents are very high in Kolkata.  Even a single life saved is invaluable,” he added. 
Purakayastha then requested CMRI to plan an ambulance scheme for the Kolkata Police initiative ‘Pronam’ for senior citizens.  The hospital’s vice-president (operations) Jashodhara Ghosh responded: “We are happy to confirm our participation. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Tree hacked, rare birds lose their habitat  It was a condolence meeting for an untimely death of a tree that proved shelter for rare migratory birds at Rabindra Sarovar which blossomed into a spontaneous movement on Sunday morning.  The rare birds, they rued, would not come back again.  After setting a precedence in creating awareness, the organisers, a motely group of bird-watchers, morning walkers and nature lovers, now want to take the movement forward to ensure that whoever, an individual or government agency think twice before hacking a tree in a park or on the road side. 
The organisers put a wreath on the remainder of the hacked full-grown Segun tree (teak) at Safari Park, at Rabindra Sarovar, but the wide array of emotions it evoked on Sunday morning was quite extra-ordinary.  It was an opportunity for nature lovers to drive home the point that the loss was irreversible and it is high time to zero in on the perpetrators and punish them. 
“The hacking of the tree is shocking as we kept informing Safari Park officials how the small patch of land in the Safari Park has become a sanctuary of rare migratory birds.  We spotted on September 9 Indian Paradise Flycatcher, on 10 Brown Breasted Flycatcher, on 12, Asian Brown Flycatcher on 27 Forest Wagtail and on the same day a pair of Bluethroats,” said Sudip Ghosh, an avid bird-watcher, who was pleasantly surprised by the arrival of the rare guests.  “Where else in Kolkata could you find them?” he asked. 
“But to our shock, on September 29, we found the dense habitat completely destroyed.  Shegun trees and fruit bearing trees, thickets, undergrowth all cleared.  They could never gauge the irreversible damage they caused.  The birds would just fly away once they look down,” rued D J Ckakraborty, another passionate bird-watcher.  Their environment needs undergrowth, dead trees, thickets, bushes and not just lawns.  Safari park is a unique place where morning walkers and birds can live peacefully just that they need that small space, he added. 
S K Dubey, a keeper of the Lions Safari Park, owns up the responsibility of hacking the tree.  “I did not understand it, my mistake. ” But nature lovers are ready to accept his apology.  “He hacked it because it is Segun, knowing the value of timber.  It cannot be one-of-case.  They must have smuggled out many such trees,” said Chakraborty.  Environmentalists, who examined the natural damage, filed a complaint with the Lake Police Station on Friday 2 October 2015. 
“When inspected by nature-lovers on Friday morning, the tree stump was still oozing sap, indicating that the murder was recent.  The Safari Park showed ample evidence of the tree stem and branches being piled for onward disposal.  The evident reason for the hacking of the trees was the need for ‘forest’ clearance masterminded by the Lions Club of North Kolkata and the consequent ‘development’ of Safari Park,” said Mudar Patherya, another environmentalist. 
The increasing attempts of converting a naturally grown urban forest into a manicured park are evident all over the Safari Park.  A concrete base of a fountain has come up at a place where full grown tree once existed.  “The problem begins when we start thinking that even the nature belongs to us only.  All other creatures exist because of us.  So, we tend to bulldoze when nature does not conform our utilities,” said nature activist Arjan Basu Roy. 
Susmita Banerjee, a court appointed authority for Rabindra Sarovar’s greenery, tried to down play significance of the condolence meeting.  “I admit that a tree was hacked.  It is indeed a mistake.  But these people are trying make a mountain out of a mole. ” But her comment only drew the wrath of the nature lovers at the Park.  Please first read the laws and the legal provisions against their violations,” said Sanchita Dey.  Another campaigner.  The Safari Park, which enjoys a 300m frontage on Southern Avenue, has been leased for maintenance purposes by Kolkata Improvement Trust, a government body that owns the 192 acre Rabindra Sarobar. 
In the last couple of years, the Lions Club of North Kolkata has ‘developed’ Safari Park through concrete investments in a musical fountain, congregation platforms, deities of goddesses (transforming the park into an open air place of worship for members of a specific community) and home for the gardener.

Kolkata Metro Puja gift: Wi-Fi &amp; app to track trains  KOLKATA: Metro rolled out free Wi-Fi at Park Street and Maidan stations on Tuesday and promised to extend it along the length of the network very soon. 
Along with Puja gift came the announcement that Metro will run a record 738 services during the festive days, starting at 1.40pm on October 20, 21 and 22 and continuing till 4 am on October 22.  On October 23, services end at 11pm.  Metro has also launched an app through which passengers can track trains and stay updated about special services.

Commandos, ladies squads to be deployed by Kolkata Metro during Pujas  KOLKATA: Metro Railway will deploy a commando unit and three women squads for security during the four days of the Pujas this year.  A ‘striking reserve’ will also be stationed at Metro Bhavan to rush to any spot in case of an emergency.  The security personnel will be deployed in two shifts from 1.30pm to 4.30am, an official said. 
“This year, we will deploy 415 security personnel every day between October 20 and October 24.  In 2014, we deployed 350 security personnel.  They will be deployed in two shifts, from 1.30pm to 9.30pm and 9.30pm to 4.30am.  We shall also have three ladies squads comprising 11 personnel each.  These will be stationed at Dumdum, Sovabazar and Kalighat.  We have selected these stations as there is a lot of rush there during the Pujas.  Each squad will comprise a lady officer and five lady constables.  Every squad will also have five more constables.  They may be male or female, depending upon availability.  Last year, there was only one such squad for the entire stretch,” said Indrani Banerjee, Sr PRO, Metro Railway. 
The commando unit that will be deployed at Kalighat will comprise a dozen personnel.  According to Banerjee, the unit will have 11 trained commandos led by an officer.  They will also work both shifts and move to any station if there is trouble.  The ladies squads will be deployed on platforms, particularly after evening and throughout the night to check molestation and other crime against women. 
“We are also taking steps to prevent all sorts of crime including attempts by subversive elements to disrupt services.  The ‘striking reserve’ at our headquarters will remain alert to react to any situation.  The personnel will rush to any station at a moment’s notice.  In 2014, we had concentrated our security staff at Dumdum, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Chandni Chowk, Esplanade and Rabindra Sadan.  Apart from these stations, there will be deployments at Sovabazar, Jatin Das Park and Rabindra Sarovar this year.  We have added these three stations as well as there were huge crowds there last year.  Apart from all this, there will be special monitoring by the Kolkata Police.  Metro authorities will co-ordinate with all agencies to ensure a safe Puja for passengers,” Banerjee added.

The tallest ever Durga idol in the world has now found a place for itself in the Limca Book of Records, Asian Book of Records and Indian Book of Records.  It may also lead its way to the Guinness World Records. 
The idol, like its counterparts in the city, will not vanish into oblivion.  This fibreglass idol will be dismantled and re-assem bled at its new address.  It could be Eco Park or Rabindra Sarovar or any other place in the city.  Keeping in mind the huge traffic that brought the city to a standstill, the key criteria to find the goddess a new home would be traffic control capacities in the area.  The Durga Puja committee would be meeting on Tuesday evening to take a call on the same alongside deciding who walks away with the idol. 
Apart from the sole sponsors of the puja -Star Cement, others in the race to take up the preservation are city industrialists like Harshavardhan Neotia, the Birlas and several others whose names could not be ascertained.  Relocation of the idol would also call for a bit of remodeling in terms of the basic structure support. 
“A temporary bamboo structure was made because the idol was to be around only for the pujas.  A steel structure will have to be made to support the gigantic idol and ensure that it stays safe against natural calamities,“ said Sanjay Agarwal, director, Star Cement. 
Star Cement, the cement manufacturing company promoted by the Kolkata based Century Plyboards group, had invested Rs 6 crore in running the three-month close to long campaign promoting not just the Deshapriya Park puja but also the company.  The move was part of Star Cement's brand building exercise to increase its foothold in eastern India.  The campaign that ran across West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Agartala, Jharkhand and Bihar was designed by JWT who are pulling up their socks to design a fresh campaign revolving around the same idol.  However, this time the budget would be tighter.  The new campaign would be unveiled by the end of the week. 
Despite the controversy surrounding the puja, the sponsors (Star Cement) seems to have achieved targets in terms of grabbing eyeballs.  Thanks to the frenzy the campaign created, Star Cement is now a household name, at least in Bengal, added Agarwal.

Lakhan Ke Padde,"Badals bent upon framing Congress leaders in false cases: Bajwa CHANDIGARH: Accusing SAD of indulging in "" political vendetta"" , Congress today alleged that the top leadership of the ruling party was "" conspiring""  to implicate its leaders in false cases to gag the opposition voice. 
Punjab Congress president Partap Singh Bajwa slammed Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal alleging that they were "" intimidating, threatening and gaging voice of opposition"" . 
The "" Badal government is conspiring to frame""  Congress spokesperson Sukhpal Singh Khaira in a drug case, Bajwa said at a press meet here, also attended by former MLA Khaira, AICC secretary Kuljeet Singh Nagra and two other sitting MLAs. 
Khaira had been vocal against the Badal family for their alleged "" corrupt, tyrannical and unconstitutional rule. "" 
Unable to bear the brunt of the frontal attack launched by Congress, the Badal duo and their "" police militia""  have once again embarked on their favorite political vendetta drive, by singling out important party functionaries to gag the voice of the opposition, Bajwa alleged. 
Khaira said the Badal regime has registered six "" false FIRs""  against him during the past few years.  "" Not content with this political victimisation of Khaira and unable to coerce him into silence, the Badals are now conspiring to register more criminal cases against him,""  Bajwa said. 
Khaira said police had recently arrested former sarpanch of Lakhan Ke Padde village in Fazilka Gurdev Singh.  "" Police under political pressure recorded a false statement of Gurdev Singh after torturing him to implicate Khaira in the drug case,""  Bajwa said. 
The Badals have also "" falsely implicated""  two Independent MLAs from Ludhiana, who are brothers, recently, he claimed. 
Bajwa said Congress would soon meet the Governor to apprise him of this "" political vendetta""  against party functionaries and demanded that Special Investigation Teams be formed to look into the links of the Badals and Revenue Minister Bikram Singh Majithia with drug smugglers. 
Khaira said "" soon the government is going to book me in false cases, they have withdrawn by security cover and I am pretty sure that they are going to physically eliminate me by way of road accident as so many accidents take place. "" 
Meanwhile, Khaira ruled our joining Aam Aadmi Party.  He, however, admitted that at one point of time he wanted to join AAP as his NRI supporters asked him to do so.  "" But seeing AAP functioning as they expelled their founder members and dictatorial attitude, I decided to not to go ahead and decided to remain in Congress,""  Khaira said.

Four A garden of 190 plants of the Western Ghats tree species grown from irradiated seeds (exposed to Gamma rays) has come up on the Mangalagangotri campus of Mangalore University.  It boasts of plants of six species endemic to the Western Ghats, planted three months ago. 
It was the result of a four-year research project on ‘radiation effect on forest tree species’ by the Department of Applied Botany at the university under a Rs.  65-lakh project granted from the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS) under the Department of Atomic Energy.  It is said to be the first such study on forest species in the country. 
K. R.  Chandrashekar, professor, Department of Applied Botany and Principal Investigator of the project, said that seeds of 14 tree species of the Western Ghats belonging to 10 families were irradiated. 
The purpose was to evaluate the impact on the germination physiology and biochemical constituents of the seeds.  Irradiation has led to faster germination and faster growth with vigour in case of three species. 
Of the 14 species, six species were endemic to the Western Ghats, two belonged to the endangered category, two were threatened and four were wild medicinal plants. 
The samples were collected from their wild habitat and subjected to Gamma irradiation using the doses ranging from 25-300 Grays (a unit for measuring absorbed radiation). 
He said the forest plants have been classified for the first time on the basis of their response to Gamma radiation as tolerant, moderately sensitive and sensitive species. 
Tolerant plants can withstand certain doses of radiation and also show faster germination and faster growth.  For example, dormant wild species such as  Canarium strictum (dhoopa),  Terminalia chebula (alale) and  Terminalia arjuna (arjuna). 
The university will, in future, study whether irradiation has changed the medicinal properties of the plants. 
The BRNS has given “in-principle approval” to sanction Rs.  35 lakh for the study.  Additionally, more wild species endemic to Western Ghats will be taken up for seed irradiation.  Bio Mangalore University will introduce bio-metric with face interface attendance registering system for its students on its Mangalagangotri campus and its two constituent colleges from the academic year 2015-16. 
It would be introduced for teachers and non-teaching staff within two months from now, said Vice-Chancellor K.  Byrappa. 
Now 75 per cent attendance in each subject in an academic year is mandatory for a student to appear for any examination. 
The Academic Council in its meeting agreed to conduct special classes for foreign students of the university to meet the requirement of attendance as they usual join late after fulfilling certain requirements of the Ministry of External Affairs.  If they missed the semester examinations they could sit for them the next time, the council said.

Mangalore University to adopt villages for study Mangalore University is planning to adopt some villages for carrying out sector-specific studies and providing guidance for development, its Vice-Chancellor K.  Byrappa said here on Sunday. 
Replying to questions at a discussion on ‘Contributions of Mangalore University in Regional Development’, organised by Media Alumni Association of Mangalagangotri, the Vice-Chancellor said that the villages would be selected in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kodagu districts, the jurisdiction of the University.  “It is my dream,” the Vice-Chancellor said. 
He said that final semester students doing project works would be directed to visit such villages and submit study-based project works after identifying the issues. 
Mr.  Byrappa said that the University would ensure that more than 100 foreign students studied in its campus from the academic year 2015-16. 
He said that the University would release its vision 2030 document on its foundation day on September 10 this year.  The document would be prepared in consultation with experts in different sectors across the country. 
B. M.  Hegde, the former Vice-Chancellor, of the erstwhile Manipal Academy of Higher Education (now Manipal University), said that government control over universities should go and there should be autonomy to impart quality education.  “Now universities have become agents of the government,” he said, adding that the government should stop nominating its members (political appointments) to academic councils and syndicates of the university and instead should allow the university to select the members from among experts. 
Sripati Tantri, a former member of the Syndicate of the University, said that the University should introspect on whether it was imparting quality education. 
K.  Chinnappa Gowda, a professor of Kannada and the former Registrar (administration) of the University, said that the University in all these years has been able to identify traditional knowledge system of the region and foster it.  P. S.  Yadapadithaya, Registrar (administration), said that the university would shortly organise an open house to showcase its strength. 
Earlier, Manohar Prasad was felicitated on the occasion for his three decades of service as a journalist.  After felicitating him, the Vice-Chancellor announced that the University would appoint him as an adjunct professor at the university. 
Mangalore University will have a single entry point to its campus after 7 p. m.  after some months, said Vice-Chancellor K Byrappa. 
At a function here on Sunday he said that it would be done for security purposes.  The university is now taking steps for making a single entry point as researchers and students would be studying late in the night.  Mangalore University to conduct ‘open house’ on June 12, 13 Mangalore University, accredited with an A grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), will host for the first time next week, an open house to showcase its strength for the graduates who intend to join post-graduation courses in any of its institutions. 
The open house, a popular concept in foreign countries, would be conducted on June 12 and 13 at its Mangalagangotri campus, said K.  Chinnappa Gowda, professor and senior dean, and K. R.  Chandrashekar, professor and co-ordinator for the open house. 
According to Mr.  Chandrashekar, the university is the first among conventional universities in the State to conduct such a programme. 
Mr.  Gowda said the university offered 35 post-graduation courses through 27 departments on its campus, two colleges owned by it and at its post-graduation centre at Chikka Aluvara in Kodagu district. 
Degree holders and their parents could visit each department on the open house days and interact with faculty members on the scope of the courses, employment opportunities, specialisation available, past placements of students, etc. 
He said the university offered hostel, gym, sports, laboratory and library facilities.  It had about 18 study chairs that organised series of lectures by eminent persons.  It had many teachers with Ph. D.  degrees.  Such facilities would expose students to a better academic atmosphere. 
He said students in many colleges were not aware of the facilities available at the university.  If they got familiarised with the facilities it would help them take a decision on whether to join a post-graduation course of their choice in a degree college nearest to them or at the university. 
Visiting the departments and interacting with faculty members would help them shed inhibitions. 
Mr.  Chandrashekar said that each department would have their profiles to showcase their strength.  There would be help-desks to guide students and parents.  Highlights of each department would be exhibited through boards. 
Mr.  Gowda said the government wanted to increase the gross enrolment ratio of students to higher education.  Conducting an open house could prompt students to enrol for post-graduation courses.  Organising it was the brainchild of K.  Byrappa, Vice-Chancellor. 
The open house would be conducted between 10 a. m.  and 5 p. m.  If required, it would be extended to June 14.  Briefly Teacher training workshop
The International Geoscience Education Organisation would be organising a teacher training workshop at the Geological Survey of India, Mangaladevi Temple Road, between July 7 and 10, for teachers who teach earth science topics to students of high school.

‘Results available through Intranet on varsity campus’ University planning PG centre at Hiriyadkka After laying the foundation stone for an advanced science research centre at Belapu village in Udupi district recently, Mangalore University is now planning to open a postgraduate centre in the district. 
Addressing presspersons on Tuesday, K.  Byrappa, Vice-Chancellor, said that the university was examining the possibility of opening the centre at the Government First Grade College at Hiriyadkka, Udupi district. 
Discussion held
The college had 11 acres of land.  Adjoining the college, the university had identified about 39 acres suitable for the centre.  The Syndicate of the university had held a discussion on the issue. 
He said the centre would not be opened in the current academic year.  If all goes as per plans, it could be opened from the next academic year. 
Mr.  Byrappa said the university would offer postgraduate courses in Hindi and Sanskrit on the Mangalagangotri campus from the current academic year. 
A degree college, which would be a constituent college of the university, would be started at Konaje from the current academic year.  It would have B. A.  and B. Com.  courses. 
The evening college to be opened at the University College, Hampankatta, from the 2015-16 academic year, would also offer B. A.  and B. Com.  courses. 
Integrated course
He said that the university had introduced a five-year integrated course in tourism at its Field Marshal K. M.  Cariappa College. 
A student joining the course after II PU and completing first year would get a diploma in tourism; after second year an advanced diploma; and a BBM degree after three years; a honours degree after four years and an MBA in integrated tourism after five years. 
In addition, a two-year postgraduate course in MBA (tourism administration) too has been started at FMKMC College. 
A second batch for the evening M. Com.  course would be started at University College if there was demand, he added.  University to offer courses in yogic sciences Mangalore University will offer certificate and diploma courses in yogic sciences at its University College in the city from this August, according to K.  Byrappa, Vice-Chancellor. 
Speaking to presspersons on the sidelines of the International Yoga Day celebrations at the University on Sunday, he said that the certificate course would be of six months and diploma course would be of one year. 
Minimum qualification
The classes would be conducted from 6.30 a. m.  to 8.30 a. m.  There would be no upper age limit to join the courses.  The minimum qualification to join the courses would be pass in the SSLC. 
The University has been offering a regular postgraduation course (M. Sc. ) in Human Consciousness and Yogic Sciences at the University campus in Mangalagangotri for over a decade. 
It was the pioneer university in the State to offer a M. Sc.  course in yoga with yoga therapy. 
Earlier, addressing a gathering during the celebrations, the Vice-Chancellor said that the need of the hour was to study the biochemical reactions in the body after doing yoga and document them.  There was a need to conduct research on this aspect and publish the findings, he said. 
Yoga lab
The Vice-Chancellor said that Govardhan Mehta, former director, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, who visited the university campus last week, showed keen interest in the M. Sc.  course in yoga offered by the university and suggested to set up a full-fledged laboratory to study the biological changes in body after yoga scientifically. 
The faculty of the Department of Human Consciousness and Yogic Sciences taught simple yoga to teachers, non-teaching staff and students at the university campus on the occasion.  No entrance test for certain courses Mangalore University, henceforth, will not conduct entrance tests for such postgraduation courses, which have received applications below the sanctioned intake seats. 
The academic council of the university, in a special meeting on Saturday, endorsed a decision taken to this effect at a meeting of chairpersons of different departments on July 17. 
K.  Byrappa, Vice-Chancellor, told the academic council meeting that the university conducted entrance tests for admission to some postgraduate courses.  There was no point in conducting entrance tests for such courses, if the number of applicants was below the number of sanctioned seats. 
The tests would have to be conducted only if the applications exceeded the sanctioned number of seats.  The academic council decided not to introduce revised syllabi for undergraduate and postgraduate courses offered under correspondence mode from the current academic year.  It was because the study material of those courses, as per the revised syllabi, was not ready. 
Hence, the courses would be offered as per the old (existing) syllabi.  The meeting was told that the council had, in its earlier meetings, approved the revised syllabi of various courses offered by the Directorate of Correspondence Courses.  Though the syllabi were ready, some expert teachers have not yet submitted the study material. 
Hence, the revised syllabi would be implemented from the academic year 2016-17. 
The council approved the draft statute governing the establishment of University Evening College at the University College premises, Hampankatta, and creation of 27 posts, including that of principal and 13 assistant professors. 
It approved the draft statute for establishing University First Grade College at university campus, Mangalagangotri, and creation of 27 posts. 
It decided to sanction an additional M. Com.  batch for G.  Shankar Government Women’s First Grade College, Udupi, for 2015-16, with certain conditions. 
To a question by a member, B.  Narayana, Registrar (Evaluation) said that the results of re-evaluation of answer scripts of undergraduate courses would be announced within August 2.  When Amrut Shenoy, a member, asked about the revised examination manual not being uploaded on the website and teachers not having access to it, Mr.  Narayana said that it would be uploaded shortly. 
‘No point in conducing test
if number of applicants is less than number of sanctioned seats’ ABVP stages protest demanding payment category fee reduction Activists of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) staged a dharna on the Mangalagangotri campus of Mangalore University on Monday urging the university to reduce payment category fees of various postgraduate courses for 2015-16. 
They squatted in front of the Mangala auditorium, where a six-day centralised counselling for admission to postgraduate courses began from Monday. 
In a memorandum submitted to the university, Jayesh P. K. , city unit secretary, ABVP, said that the university had reduced the fees hiked only for merit category seats but not for payment category seats.  According to the university now, the hike in fees for merit category seats was 10 to 12 per cent from what it was during 2014-15.  He said that all courses had limited number of merit category seats. 
Hence all applicants could not get seats under merit category.  There were many students from economically poor sections of the society who would be deprived from getting admission as the payment category fees still stood high. 
The memorandum said that fees for Applied Botany and Applied Zoology courses now stood at Rs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chattanchal,"CPI(M) Kasaragod district conference from January 9 : The three-day district conference of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), beginning January 9 at Koliyadukkam, near here, will strive to streamline the functioning of the party in its traditional stronghold, which has sizeable population of minority communities. 
The delegates meeting, to be attended by senior party leaders, will be inaugurated by Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan at 10 a. m.  The meeting will be attended by 282 delegates, who comprise 31 district committee members and 251 representatives elected from 12 party area committees and 113 local committees, district committee secretary K. P.  Satheesh Chandran told a press conference here on Tuesday. 
The valedictory session of the meeting will be held on January 11 at Chattanchal.  As many as 50,000 party workers are expected to take part. 
The delegates meeting will be inaugurated by Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.  Chandy facilitating graft: Kodiyeri The State is witnessing a phase of bad governance with scams and corruption rocking the Oommen Chandy Cabinet every day, Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI-M] Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has said. 
The Chief Minister should resign as he was facilitating corruption and pursuing anti-people policies, he said inaugurating the three-day district conference of the party at Koliyadukkam, near Chattanchal, on Friday. 
The district meet was a precursor to the party State meet in February. 
The High Court had stated that the State government cannot seek to withdraw the palmolein import case.  This clearly pointed a finger at Mr.  Chandy. 
The government was unable to implement any welfare projects for the common man, he said. 
The BJP government was pursuing neo-liberal policies more vigorously than the previous Congress government.  It promoted religious conversions.  Mr.  Chandy was extending support to the Sangh Parivar’s agenda by maintaining that the State had not witnessed any forcible conversions, he said. 
The policies of the Centre had been creating unrest in among the working class and the deprived sections. 
The Left Democratic Front (LDF) assumed significance at this point and the political climate in the State was conducive to it coming to power in the upcoming local body elections. 
The party was trying to streamline the political and organisational setup ahead of the party congress in Visakhapatnam in April. 
A. K.  Narayanan, party district committee member, presided over the function.  CM to flag off torch With days left for the commencement of the 35th National Games in Kerala, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy would flag off the Statewide relay for the games torch here on January 23.  The relay that would conclude in Thiruvananthapuram would be flagged off by Mr.  Chandy at a function scheduled at the Government college premises here at 9.30 a. m.  A meeting chaired by Collector P. S.  Muhammed Sagir in his chamber on Wednesday evolved strategies for the successful hosting of the programme.   The function will also honour sports persons from the State who took part in the previous National Games.  The authorities here have decided to accord a rousing reception to the torch relay in eight centres – Cherkala, Chattanchal, Periye, Kanhangad, Neeleshwaram, Cheruvathur and Kalikadavu, official sources here said.  The meeting was also attended by ADM H.  Dineshan besides other senior district officials and senior office-bearers of the district sports council and other sports bodies.

A piece of land for all his music Only music could be more sweet for vocalist Ustad Hassan Bhai.  On Tuesday, the 71-year-old ace musician got the title deed for five cents of land at a revenue adalat here. 
Ustad, as he is fondly called, is well-versed in Carnatic, Hindustani, and Western vocal.  This former disciple of Shehnai maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan had been staying in a rented house at Koliyadukkam in Chemnad grama panchayat. 
He had to dispose of his 20 cents of land to marry off his three daughters.  He and his ailing wife then shifted to the rented house, he said. 
He had been surviving on the meagre salary paid by the Saraswathi Sangeetha Kala Kshethra at Paravanadukkam.  He also taught children at Palakkunu, Vellarikundu, Bovikkanam, Kanhangad, and Kannur, sources said. 
Ustad Hassan Bhai, who can reportedly play 30 varieties of musical instruments, opted not to take hefty remunerations for his recitals in the true traditions of music.  His plot was at Chattanchal, sources said.  Ustad Hassan Bhai was all thanks to the district for having included his name for the title deed.  The music does not stop as Hassan Bhai intends to build a house on the plot.  Assembly furore: LDF pickets key offices The dramatic incidents and unprecedented chaotic scenes witnessed during the budget presentation in the State Assembly on Friday had its repercussion here with the LDF activists picketing taluk, village, and sub-registrar offices in the district. 
Raising slogan against the UDF government accusing K. M.  Mani as tainted Finance Minister, the LDF activists laid siege of the key seats of power in the five Assembly segments in the district partially disrupting the functioning of the offices. 
The protesters picketed taluk offices in Manjeshwaram, Kasaragod, and Hosdurg (Kanhangad), village office at Chattanchal, and Sub-Registrar office in Trikaripur. 
The protesters resented the moves to deploy heavy posse of watch-and-ward personnel and police inside and outside the Assembly, during the budget presentation. 
Large numbers of police personnel were deployed at the picketing venues as the LDF activists took out a march in Kanhangad.  UDF observes ‘black day’ The United Democratic Front (UDF) observed ‘black day’ on Sunday in protest against the conduct of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) MLAs in the Assembly during the Budget presentation on Friday. 
Inaugurating a public meeting, DCC president C. K.  Sreedharan said the display of violence in the Assembly to prevent Finance Minister K. M.  Mani from presenting the budget, terming him a tainted Minister, was a pointer to the fact that the CPI(M)-led LDF was deviating from taking up issues of public concern and appeared to be isolating itself by launching ‘anti-people’ agitations. 
The Left parties in recent times were bent upon adopting any means to ensure that the elected government failed to discharge its responsibilities, he alleged. 
Leaders of various UDF constituent parties took part in a public meeting, organised by the UDF district committee, at Chattanchal, some 12 km from here. 
A similar meeting organised by the UDF Kanhangad mandalam committee was inaugurated by KPCC executive member M. C.  Jose at Kottachery.  Burglars decamp with postal parcels Thieves decamped with parcel bags from the Kudlu RD Nagar branch post office, near here.  The incident came to notice when the postal employees opened the office on Thursday after two consecutive holidays. 
A complaint lodged at the Town police station here said that 15 parcel bags were stolen by the burglars who broke open the front door of the building. 
The burglary is the third in recent times.  Burglars had earlier targeted post offices at Shiribagilu and Chattanchal earlier.  The incidents have brought to light the need for enhancing vigil at building housing post offices.  Temple burglary: 2 held with idols The police here have arrested two persons, including the prime accused, in connection with the burglary at Kammadam Bhagavathi temple near Chittarikkal.  The police team led by Vellarikundu Circle Inspector T. P.  Sumesh arrested Ahamed Kabir, 25, the prime accused, and K. V.  Sadanandan, 39.  The police are on the lookout for the absconding Tajuddin, a resident of Mangad near Uduma.  Superintendent of Police K.  Srinivas at a press conference on Monday said the accused stole the panchaloha and brass idols.  The duo were remanded to 14 days custody by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II in Kanhangad.  The idols, which are valued over Rs.16 lakh, were found kept in a sack in the house of Ahammed Kabir at Chattanchal.

The SAY examination will be held at 128 centres on August 2.

The accident occurred around 1.30 p. m.  when the private bus plying on the Kanhangad-Kasaragod route collided with the fish-laden truck while negotiating a sharp curve, the police said. 
Jamila, 44, a resident of Kunnupara near Chattanchal, was taken to a hospital in Mangalore with critical injuries while 10 others, including the bus driver, were admitted to E. K.  Nayanar Cooperative hospital at Chengala. 
Traffic was disrupted for over an hour on the busy and narrow NH stretch because of the accident.  Rs.9.74 lakh lost during bike ride Cash worth Rs.9.74 lakh is said to have been lost while carrying it in a motorcycle after withdrawing it from a treasury here on Friday. 
The cash, said to be salary and Onam allowance for the staff members of Government High School, Pakkam, near Bekal, was reportedly lost while carrying it in a motorcycle after withdrawing the amount from the Sub-treasury at Chattanchal. 
Rajesh, a teacher of the school carrying the cash bag hooked to his motorcycle, realised the loss as he reached Kuniya locality by riding through the badly damaged National Highway, according to a complaint filed with the Bekal police, said.

Besant Nagar,"Party begins early as Chennai rings in new year  CHENNAI: The bubbly was uncorked early as the city got ready to usher in the New Year.  Some attended midnight mass at church before partying, while a few others tucked in early to make sure they would wake up soon for a visit to a temple. 
A vibrant energy infused the air in the city on New Year's eve.  From normally surly autorickshaw drivers wishing their passengers a good year to strangers embracing each other in shops, restaurants and even among speeding vehicles, almost everyone wanted to greet everyone else. 
Ravi Raghavan and his wife were among the energetic all-nighters.  "" We usually start New Year's Eve with a round of golf, relax at a club, get drinks and dinner delivered at home and head out for dessert at 1am and filter coffee at 4am,""  Raghavan said.  "" This time there will be a trip to the temple as January 1 is vaikunta ekadasi. "" 
More than 15,000 police personnel were on the roads to maintain law and order and ensure the celebrations were safe and stress-free.  Following the bomb blast in Bengaluru, all places where parties were planned were told to compulsorily install CCTV cameras at entry and exit points.  Restaurants were warned against serving liquor after 1am. 
Several companies let their employees go home early to spend time with friends and family.  "" We were let off by 2pm after which our company organised games and distributed prizes,""  said Shiva Ranjan, a banking app designer.  But getting home was not easy.  Places like General Patters Road and Nungambakkam High Road were choked with vehicles as people headed out to party or worship. 
The city's beaches were swamped with revellers.  The famous Elliot's Beach in Besant Nagar was completely packed as was the nearby Velankanni church.  Vehicles were stopped much ahead of the beach promenade. 
In the kuppam (fishing hamlet) at Kottivakkam, the 'line' was clearly drawn - the men celebrated on one side with Tamil 'gaana' numbers, while their women huddled on the other, quietly talking. 
The trend of house parties was also in evidence.  "" Clubs are way too crowded and expensive.  At house parties there is a closed circle and we have the kind of fun we want,""  said Sinduri Shyam Sundar of Adyar.  "" We are also safer inside and we can stay back and not drive in the middle of the night,""  added Reema Mukherjee, who threw a party at her Alwarpet residence, complete with a dress code. 
These parties are also an alternative for those who miss booking tables at hotels.  "" Many hotels offer packages where you can have dinner, party and stay in a room to avoid drunk driving,""  said Pradeep Kumar. 
For Suganthi K, attending midnight mass on New Year eve has been a ritual since her school days.  Now, her husband accompanies her.  "" We attend a midnight mass and then go to a temple nearby,""  she said.  The mother of two said she felt at peace while attending a mass.  "" I feel positive that the year ahead will be good,""  she said.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  New Year parties peaceful in Chennai barring minor accidents  CHENNAI: The celebrations in the city to usher in the New Year were relatively peaceful but there were some accidents despite police’s careful preparations.  At least 300 people were injured in minor accidents, mostly on interior roads, in Chennai and its suburbs, while three people were killed. 
More than 18,000 police personnel, including senior officers, were out on the roads, some until 3am, to ensure there were no untoward incidents.  They were largely successful.  No cases of drunk driving were registered but those found driving while drunk were told to stop at the place and proceed only after they got sober. 
As on previous occasions, the city’s beaches bore the brunt of the revelry.  While the famous Marina, where at least 7 lakh people partied into the wee hours, generated 4.5 tonnes of garbage, while the Elliot’s beach in Besant Nagar generated 2.5 tonnes of waste.

Action taken on plaints, fibs Chennai corporation  CHENNAI: Since it was launched to allow residents to complain about grievances, the city corporation’s toll-free number 1913 has been inundated with calls.  The staff manning the line call complainants to enquire about the ‘service’ and the corporation sends ‘action taken’ messages.  However, residents say, problems remain.  Last month, V S Lingaperumal of Velachery complained about hawkers completely taking over the pavements on CSIR Road in Taramani.  “Four days later, I got an “action taken” message and then a “complaint closed” message but the encroachers are still there,” he said.  “I rang up all officers in the zone but everyone was vague,” he said.  Curious, he chatted with the encroachers.  “They told me they pay the ward councillor 10,000 a year. ” Others have had experiences ranging from the bizarre to funny.  A day after T D Babu of Shastri Nagar complained of a tea stall encroaching upon a pavement, a corporation dog-catching van landed up at his house.  “The staff took a dog menace complaint,” he said, laughing.  “ What is the point in having this system or complaining online which doesn’t free us from hassles when we still have to personally chase officials?” Babu says he’s made at least one complaint a day but has never been satisfied.  Bharath,* of Besant Nagar, says he has been making the same complaint for three years, in vain.  “A company is using a residential building for commercial purposes without corporation approval.  But no action was taken.  We are worried this will be unofficially regularised and our residential locality will turn commercial,” he said.  The corporation admits to such “errors” and says it is sensitising employees to respond better.  “Prompt action is taken in complaints about garbage, street lights, mosquitoes, dog menace.  But complaints such as encroachments and unauthorised constructions take more time to be redressed.  Some may be tangled in legal disputes,” said an official.  “Some employees close cases to show statistics and to ensure they are not hauled up but we are addressing this issue. ” The system works like this: A resident calls 1913 and makes a complaint.  The operator registers it online with the complainant’s name, address and mobile number.  This is forwarded to the assistant engineer and only he/she can close the complaint after informing the complainant.  “We call and check if the complaint has been taken care of as we get many calls saying the complaint has been closed without action being taken,” said a member of ‘1913’.  “If it has been falsely closed, we inform the AE but our role stops there,” he said.

It used photograph identification software to weed out as many as 15,736 duplicate entries of voters in Chennai. 
"" The elections department developed software for a pilot de-duplication drive.  Officials used the software to scan photographs of voters and found 15,736 multiple entries,""  chief electoral officer Sandeep Saxena said.  "" We deleted the names of these voters after issuing notices to them. "" 
The software initially identified a list of 58,000 possible duplicate entries by photographic comparison.  It scans facial dimensions and features to identify individuals but has a margin of error and may identify different individuals as the same person. 
But armed with the list of possible duplicate entries, election officials conducted a field verification and found that in 15,736 instances the software correctly identified replica entries. Saxena said officials will use the software to identify multiple voter entries in the rolls in other districts in the coming months.  Officials deleted a total of 2.87 lakh entries in the summary revision. 
Chennai district election officer Vikram Kapur released the final electoral roll at Ripon Buildings.  Statistics from the Chennai district election office show Velachery, which includes Gandhi Nagar, Besant Nagar, Kasturba Nagar and Taramani, has 2.85 lakh voters, more than any other constituency.  It is followed by Perambur (2.77 lakh), Virugambakkam (2.76 lakh), Anna Nagar (2.75 lakh) and Saidapet (2.69 lakh). 
Women voters have outnumbered men in the electoral rolls in Chennai district.  Of the total 38.34 lakh voters enrolled, 19.11 lakh were men, 19.21 lakh were women and 769 were transgenders. 
Kapur said 57,922 new voters were included on the electoral rolls since October 15, 2014, of which 25,407 reached the age of 18 after the last election. 
Officials will distribute voter ID cards at polling stations on January 25, National Voters Day.  Voters can check to see if their names are included on the rolls in the corporation's zonal offices.

No more rain likely in Chennai, says Met office but predicts more misty mornings  CHENNAI: The northeast monsoon has ended and there will be no more rain this season, the regional meteorological office has declared.  City residents can, however, expect misty mornings as long as winter lasts, officials said. 
While the city was enveloped in mist early on Saturday and Sunday, even throwing flights off schedule at the Chennai airport, by Monday the visibility had improved considerably.  "" Mist is usually a seasonal occurrence, but it may even appear in March or April.  The city can expect misty mornings on any day through the winter,""  said area cyclone warning centre director S R Ramanan. 
Over the weekend, northerly winds caused the humid city air to condense, resulting in mist.  "" Mist occurs when cool winds blowing from the northern part of the country interact with humid air in the city causing condensation,""  said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist of private weather forecasting agency Skymet. 
Mist may also occur after a cold night just after sunrise if the skies are clear and air still, he said.  "" After a warm day, the surface of the earth heats up.  As night falls and temperature drops, the earth surface begins to cool, turning coldest just before sunrise.  At sunrise when the temperature rises, air turns warm and humid.  The cool earth surface turns the warm, humid air into mist which eventually evaporates.  This may not occur if the sky is cloudy as it traps humid air from escaping,""  added Palawat. 
While Chennai airport officials had a torrid time rescheduling and rerouting flights during the weekend, morning walkers said they look forward to winters to experience the mist.  Jogger V Karthikeyan said, "" I visit the Marina every year during the winters just to enjoy the mist.  Today, a soothing coolness and reduced visibility cloaked the city.  It was a relaxing break from the humid mornings. "" 
However motorists were not so thrilled.  "" It is safer to drive slowly when you are enveloped in mist.  I ended up reaching office late on Saturday,""  IT employee R Jagannathan said.  Most areas, including Triplicane, East Coast Road and Besant Nagar, were covered in mist over the weekend. 
This week the sky over the city will be partly cloudy with the maximum temperature at 31 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature 24 degrees Celsius, as per the met website.  However, all it takes is for the sky to be clear for a few hours in the morning for mist to form, officials said. 
The city received 129cm of rain in 2014, including the rain from the southwest monsoon, against the 109cm of rain in 2013.  The northeast monsoon that set in on October 21, 2014 brought 75cm of rain against the 44cm of rain brought by the previous northeast monsoon.

Veteran actor V S Raghavan dead  CHENNAI: Tamil film actor V S Raghavan passed away in his sleep at a hospital in T Nagar on Saturday evening after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  He was 89 and is survived by his sons K R Srinivasan and K R Krishna, daughters-in-law and a grandson. 
A seasoned veteran of more than 1,000 films, Raghavan was seen recently in âOru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavaanikalumâ (2014) and TV serials Valli, En Iniya Thozhi and Uyirmei.  He began his career as a sub-editor at Maalathi magazine and went on to act in stage plays.  After acting in a play âVairamaalaiâ, Raghavan went on to make his film debut in the screen adaptation of the play under the same title in 1954. 
Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa paid tributes to the veteran artist in a press release: âHe treated everybody with love and affection.  His death is a great loss to the film industry.  I convey my heartfelt condolences to his family and his friends in the film fraternitym,â she said. 
One of the few actors to have played âfatherâ to legends M G Ramachandran and Sivaji Ganesan in several films, Raghavanâs most memorable movies include âNenjil Ore Aalayamâ (1962), âKarnanâ (1964), âKaadhalikka Neramillaiâ (1964), âBommaiâ (1964), âIru Kodugalâ (1969) and âUrimaikkuralâ (1974). 
He shared a special friendship with late director K Balachander who directed him in several films.  Raghavan was noted for his role in Balachander-directed tele-serial Anni in the early 2000s and headed the Tamil Nadu Iyal Isai Naadaga Manram in the early 1990s.

Silambarasan, accompanied by his father Suresh and 15 other relatives, was playing with his sister near the water.  Suddenly he was dragged in to the water by a huge tidal wave.

While 171 dead turtles were washed ashore in 2012, the number rose to 185 in 2014.  In 2015, with more than half the season to go, the death toll has already touched 100 between Napiers Bridge and Srinivasapuram and 151 between Neelankarai and Besant Nagar.  The number of death turtles in just the first week of February is 66, said SSTCN reports. 
To put this number in perspective, activists cite the situation in 1982, when 20 dead turtles washed ashore. 
“Since the nesting along the Madras Beach can be categorised as only ‘ thin’ or moderate, mortality due to incidental catch in fishing operations of nesting females could have an adverse effect on the breeding population visiting the coast and consequently on recruitment. 
A careful study of this is needed in order to advice any preventive and precautionary regulatory measures to be adopted in specific type of fishing operations during the nesting season,” reads the report ‘Recovery programme for Olive Ridleys (Lepidochelys Olivacea) along the Madras coast by E G Silas and M Rajagopalan, published by Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute in 1982. 
More than 30 years later, the threat of ‘unregulated fishing operations’ is as persistent as ever.  In a petition filed in the Madras high court, the amicus argued that Chennai’s coast was on the migratory route for these turtles to reach the coasts of Odisha and other nesting grounds along the east coast.  “The culling of turtles along our coast therefore does not affect only the turtles that approach our shores to nest but results in a massacre of the migrating turtles as well,” read the petition.  The biggest danger to the turtles are the nets used by trawlers and gill nets used by smaller fisherman.  Conservationists advocate the use of turtle-excluding devices to save Olive Ridleys.  “They can cost as little as 5,000 to install but can save thousands of turtles,” said Akila Balu of SSTCN. 
Turtles come to Chennai and other parts of the eastern coast between late December and early April.  Each turtle lays eggs at least two times with each nest having around 100 eggs. 
While nests are sometime poached, hatchlings are often eaten by dogs or die of dehydration when they get distracted by street lights and head towards the road instead of the sea.  With such low survival rates, conservationists estimate that only one in 1,000 eggs reaches adulthood.  Adult turtles, on the other hand, get entangled in nets.  They either drown or have their flippers cut off fishermen who want to get rid of the turtle without damaging their nets.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Ambulance on Marina sands to rescue visitors from drowning  CHENNAI: Drowning off the Marina has become too frequent an incident, and rescuers are finding it difficult to take the victims to hospitals in time.  They have to be first carried across the beach to the ambulance on the service lane, sometimes a few hundred metres away, and precious time is lost.  Now, a four-wheel drive ambulance from the ‘108’ service promises to pick up the victims from the shoreline, cutting time and saving lives. 
The service begins on Thursday.  The all-terrain vehicle can move on the sand and provide first-aid to people being rescued from the water and move them quickly to a hospital.  Every week more than four people drown off the city beaches, but the government hasn’t found it necessary to post life guards.  When authorities argue that guards cannot be posted as swimming here is per se illegal, the four-wheel drive ambulance on the beach is an improvement to the grave situation. 
“These ambulances are equipped to attend to emergencies in non-motorable areas,” said B Prabhudoss, regional manager of GVK EMRI that operates 108 in Tamil Nadu.  “To begin with, we will employ them in and around Marina beach.  “Except for the size of the vehicle, which is smaller than the regular ambulance on road to facilitate quicker reach, the facilities in the ambulance will be the same. ” They will attend to emergencies of visitors as well as residents of the neighbouring fishing hamlets. ” 108 will soon launch more ambulances at beaches in Besant Nagar, Mahabalipuram and Pazhaverkadu. 
The city police have been taking efforts to keep a tab on swimmers at the beach by deploying personnel on beach buggies.  Coastal Security Group also keep vigil along the coast on all-terrain vehicles.  Despite all this, many venture into the sea. 
The National Crime Records Bureau statistics show that in 2013, Chennai reported 265 drowning cases, which was the highest among 53 major cities in the country.  At least four cases were reported last week.  The ‘108’ ambulance vehicles attend to about 50 cases a month on the city beaches.  The government-run service, which has a fleet of 684 ambulances, has 30 all-terrain vehicles for hilly regions of the state.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Demand for organic products up in Chennai  CHENNAI: When Supriya Arokyaraj developed a skin condition, she realised that the soaps and detergents she used to wash her clothes were aggravating it.  She began hunting for organic products made purely out of plant extracts. 
âI began using a neem soap and an organic detergent and my skin has improved,â says the 35-year-old, who now only uses organic soaps, detergents and floor cleaners.  âThey are also environment-friendly. â
With increasing awareness, a market for organic household cleaning and personal care products is emerging in the city.  Slowly, stores and manufacturers are catering to this segment. 
Nadeera Harris of Desi Basics on Greams Road sources and sells organic kitchenware as well as cosmetics and cleaning products.  âFor the past three years, we have been selling organic soaps, shampoos, and shower gels as well as indigo hair dye made of indigo and henna powder.  They are all totally herbal, free of chemicals and have not been tested on animals,â says Nadeera, who will showcase her products at The Annual Redwood Organic Fair at The Redwood Montessori School LLP in Besant Nagar from 4pm to 7pm on Saturday. 
At Desi Basics, customers can pick from neem, tulsi, vettiver, or lavender soaps as well as organic mosquito repellents made of lemon grass and eucalyptus. 
Srinivas Krishnaswamy and Preethi Sukumaran, co-founders of Krya, have been manufacturing organic cleaning products for the last three years.  âWe have a detergent for clothes as well as a dish wash product, and are working on other cleaning products,â says Srinivas. 
Their detergent is made of certified organic soap berries, processed in a particular way so as to make it suitable for a washing machine.  âThe dish washing product has soap berry, neem leaf, and lemongrass,â says Srinivas. 
Chemical ingredients and bleaching agents pollute the environment.  âFrom the washing machine, these ingredients go into the sewage system and ultimately the sea or river or some other water body.  Every day, so much chemical goes out of Indian homes,â says Srinivas, whose products are not only organic but also packaged in recycled brown paper cartons. 
Events such as The Annual Redwood Organic Fair, being held for the fifth time, help consumers source organic products.  It will feature everything from organic food to clothing, and oils.  âWhen we started the school, we wanted to provide organic food to the children and had to search for places selling organic produce,â says Shankari Subbiah, principal, who decided to organize the Fair along with Madhura Visweswaran, correspondent.  âSo we thought it is important to tell the community at large where it is available. â Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Besant Nagar man, 93, missing after walk  CHENNAI: A 93-year-old resident of Besant Nagar who left home for a walk three days ago, has not returned.  R Sampath Kumar, an ex-serviceman, woke up and had a cup of tea on Thursday before stepping out. 
His son S Parthasarathy, 68, said he tried to dissuade him, but could not.  "" He normally did not go for morning walks, but on Thursday he insisted on stepping out after his tea.  And since then he's been missing. ""  The family has searched hospitals in the city and got in touch with relatives in his native Srirangam to carry out inquiries, but to no avail. 
"" I have searched all the hospitals and old age homes.  My relatives in Srirangam have also not been able to locate him,""  said Parthasarathy.  Police have registered a complaint and circulated his photograph among patrol vehicles. 
Sampath Kumar, who spent most of his life in Assam, retired as a food analyst at an army facility.  The family described him as keeping fairly good health although getting a bit forgetful of late.  "" He was an army man so he would never use his walking stick and always walked upright.  He had hearing problems and at times ask us who he was,""  said P.  Rukmani, the missing man's daughter-in-law. 
Parthasarathy said a few years ago his father took off on a moped to visit the army canteen and had a fall near the Monroe statue.  A few people rushed him to the general hospital but took away the Rs 3,000 he had on him, he said.  "" I would keep advising him not to go out alone but he would say he was bored and needed a walk. ""  The son said most of the time he would allow his father to go out for a walk alone, but would follow him at a distance to keep an eye on him till he returned home.  "" He was a regular at the temple and we searched there but could not find him. "" 
Parthasarathy said, "" there are times when he has gone missing and I have managed to trace him as I know the route he takes for a walk.  He will not go outside Besant Nagar.  My appeal to the general public is to please call us on 9840112225 if you spot him anywhere. "" 
Sampath Kumar was dressed in an olive green shirt and a dhoti.  Rukmani said she hoped he was unharmed since he always carried cash on him.  "" Once he went to the bank and by just telling his name got the withdrawal form filled up and brought Rs.10,000 in cash home. "" 
"" There is absolute silence in the house without him and I hope to find him and bring him home soon,""  added Parthasarathy.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Missing 93-year-old found 20km from home  CHENNAI: Six days after a 93-year-old resident of Besant Nagar, ex-serviceman with dementia and a hearing impairment, went missing while out on a morning walk, a scrap merchant who found him unconscious near a mosque in Kundrathur, more than 20km away, reunited him with his family on Tuesday. 
Sampath Kumar’s son S Parthasarathy, 68, who in a frantic search for his father since he vanished last Thursday had distributed photographs of the elderly man among autorickshaw drivers in an attempt to track him down, says he was in Guindy on Tuesday morning when he received a call. 
“The caller identified himself as Sadiq Ali,” Parthasarathy said.  “He told me he had seen an advertisement I had taken out for my missing father in a Tamil daily on Tuesday and said he believed he had found my father.  I rushed to Chengalpet Government Hospital where Ali had admitted my father.  ”
Sampath Kumar’s daughter-in-law P Rukmani said it was nothing short of providential that someone had traced the elderly man in a city as large as Chennai, given that dementia has reduced him to a childlike stage with almost complete loss of memory. 
Visibly relieved to be back home, Sampath Kumar said, “I don’t know where I went, but that family really treated me well. ” He was referring to the family of another patient in the hospital who shared their food with him.  “I don’t mean to be a trouble to anyone and have even kept money ready for my funeral expenses,” he said.  “They helped me.  People should help others in need. ”
Ali, 42, a scrap merchant, said he found the man in an unconscious state outside a mosque in Kundrathur at 11am on Monday. 
“I realised that he had probably collapsed due to weakness.  His clothes were soiled,” he said.  “I called some friends and we cleaned him up and changed his clothes.  We knew he was hungry so we bought him idlis.  I decided to take him to hospital and then inform police. ”
“By Tuesday morning he could tell me his name.  I recalled seeing an advertisement for a missing senior citizen in a newspaper that day.  When I checked the ad again I realised that I had found Parthasarathy’s father,” Ali said.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Corporation removes bio-toilet from Besant Nagar beach  CHENNAI: More than nine months after it was installed, the bio-toilet meant to keep the famous Elliot’s beach in Besant Nagar clean has been removed.  The city corporation has landscaped the area and barricaded it with steel railings.  "" We have now sought permission from Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) authorities to shift the toilet close to Urur Olcott Kuppam,""  a corporation official said. 
The toilet complex for men and women had come up in June last year but remained locked since then after residents of the area and beachgoers protested against its location — next to the police booth smack in the middle of the beach.  The corporation had put up the 8.5 lakh toilet as part of its efforts to provide toilets on beaches for not just visitors but also for slum dwellers settled there. 
"" Even when the toilet was next to the police booth it violated CRZ norms.  And it deprived people of their sitting space,""  said Kamakshi Subramaniyan, co-founder of Spark, a Besant Nagar-based civic forum.  The organisation waged a long battle, including launching a signature campaign, for shifting the toilet.  "" They spent 8.5 lakh on the toilet and it has to be opened at the earliest in a proper location,""  said Subramaniyan. 
Corporation officials defended the move to locate the toilet next to the police booth but had to give in under pressure from residents.  A few months ago, mayor Saidai S Duraisamy inspected the place and instructed officials to shift it based on public suggestion. 
"" Beach goers wanting to use a toilet have to walk to nearby restaurants and most people end up urinating on the beach,""  said Kennith Rosario who took public opinions on the locked toilet and uploaded them on YouTube.  "" It is a shame the corporation has done so little when it comes to toilets at one of the city’s major tourist spots. ""  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Besant Nagar elders gather to regain their paradise  CHENNAI: Soon after he moved to a house on Third Avenue, Besant Nagar in 1987, T S Swaminathan, 85, would walk every morning to Elliot’s Beach.  And then, a couple of years ago he stopped going to the beach.  “It isn’t a beach any more,” said the retired IAS officer.  “And the roads leading to the beach, dug up, have become too dangerous to walk on. ”
Swaminathan says the beach has become more of an eating place.  Senior citizens like him got together on Monday evening to brainstorm to regain Besant Nagar’s charm and make the neighbourhood a better place to live in.  Organised by the Senior Citizen Group of Besant Nagar, whose members are mostly septuagenarians, the group felt that their locality, once a pensioner’s paradise, has become a senior citizen’s nightmare. 
The loss of trees over the years, an increase in stray dog menace, encroachments, and garbage on the roads prompted their initiative.  The members voiced their concern over civic issues and lack of safety.  “Vendors have taken over all the pavements, and there is no space for pedestrians,” said former Anna University professor V Chandrasekhar, who is the president of the group. 
The beauty and tranquillity associated with Besant Nagar has vanished, the lamented, the place has become noisy and polluted.  “We can barely see the sea anymore.  It is full of encroachments,” said 73- year-old Sankar Raja.  “Where is the need to have so many vendors? Authorities must license them and allot separate space for the hawkers on the fringes of the beach.  We can no longer enjoy the breeze or watch the waves. ”
Despite making several complaints, authorities have not taken any action, particularly on the issue of garbage, they say.  “There are not enough garbage bins and garbage is collected only once in three or four days,” said an elderly woman seeking anonymity.  “We are scared to leave home after sunset because of chain snatching incidents,” she said. 
The group members will take up an issue each and approach the concerned government department seeking a solution.  And there were specific suggestions at the meeting.  “The traffic police may restrict vehicles for two hours in the morning and evening near the beac",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the agency, which also supplies eggs to the state for its free noon-meal scheme.  Political parties had accused the firm of supplying eggs at a higher cost to the government.

Chennai’s wide pavement plan hits a roadblock  CHENNAI: Two years after mayor Saidai S Duraisamy announced that Chennai would get 400 pedestrian-friendly roads in four years, the project is far from reality.  Till now, only 26 of the 71 wider pavements in the first phase have been completed.  Among metros, Chennai witnesses the maximum number of road accidents, and 40% of the victims are pedestrians. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corporation officials are clueless about the deadline of the project.  “It’s difficult to widen 400 pavements in the next two years but we want to complete at least 71 with better pedestrian facilities.  The designing and consultation with stakeholders are taking more time,” said a senior corporation official. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many commuters say they are forced to walk on the middle of the road because of encroachments on pavements.  “I have been in several cities but Chennai appears to be the least pedestrian-friendly place.  Why doesn’t the corporation regulate hawkers and stop bikers from riding on the pavements?” said K Saraswathy, a regular commuter on Greams Road. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smart toilets in Chennai finally open to public  CHENNAI: The way public toilets are used in Chennai might soon undergo a change.  The Corporation of Chennai has begun installing 348 fully automated toilets across the city to promote better public health and sanitation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The corporation had earlier installed modular toilets, but they lay unused with no water and sewage connection.  Now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are a mix of electronically operated bio-toilets as well as toilets meant for women.  They are being installed in Royapuram, Medavakkam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
âWe are building these toilets in specific spots, which are otherwise infamous for rampant open defecation, officials said.  All the 348 toilets will be functional from July. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In many places Corporation had installed the modular toilet structure but they had been lying unused due to lack of water and sewage connection.  Work has recently started to provide sewage connections to these toilets. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a city where open defecation is a common menace, the government is following a wait-and-watch policy to see how people respond to the project. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officials admit that people are apprehensive about entering these modular toilets as they fear getting locked inside.  âI have so far seen urinals with half-open doors,â said advertising professional Varsha Varadarajan.  For women professionals like her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
âIf they keep the toilets dry and clean all the time, this is a good effort, we find people washing their hands and feet.  Wet toilets are really uncomfortable. â To counter lack of public bathroom etiquette, these new toilets have automated flushing facilities.  After five uses, the unit mechanically cleans the entire toilet.  These will be unmanned to prevent unscrupulous people from charging money from public when they use the facility. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The governmentâs policy is to keep public sanitation free.  All the units are fitted with GPRS devices to alert officials in the event of any vandalism. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
âThis is a good scheme but corporation must take public feedback on these toilets once they are operational,â said Kamakshi Subramanian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The forum convinced corporation to move bio-toilets on Elliotâs beach as they were installed in an area with no public access.  âPublic should be comfortable using these toilets so their locations matter.  They shouldnât hoodwink public by sheer number. â,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chennai has a little more than 900 public toilets, inadequate for its 65 lakh population.  These new toilets may come as a dignified intervention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groundwater level up, but no proper tapping yet  There is a misconception that the deeper one digs, say experts. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Groundwater tends to turn salty in sandy areas under the sea level, but shallow aquifers contain clean water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metrowater officials have attributed the rise in the water level to about 8 lakh rainwater harvesting structures in the city .  The level rose the highest in Sholinganallur where the water table jumped to 2.62m from last year's 3.79m.  Among sandy areas, Thiruvottiyur has the highest water table at 3.77m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As opposed to the general perception that areas close to the sea have salty groundwater, Raghavan, we found that about 600 homes had shallow wells of about 20-foot depth,“ he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At residential areas like Kodambakkam and Anna Nagar, which have clayey soil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But not much has been done to map shallow aquifers or devise ways to tap them.  While Metrowater and the Public Works Department have observation wells across the state, they are limited to checking the fluctuation in the levels alone.  In an effort to quantify the storage capacity of city aquifers,“ said J Saravanan, consultant hydrologist, who is part of the survey .  “While the Central government has initiated massive exercises to map aquifers in terms of their vertical and spatial disposition, there is little done to assess their water holding capacity and yield,“ he said.

Speed bumps get better", some still killers  CHENNAI: Corporation of Chennai, to its everlasting credit, has wised up. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over the past year it has removed the huge humps that did more damage to motorists and vehicles than they made the city's roads safer and replaced them with close to 1,000 Indian Road Congress compliant speed-breakers. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new speed-breakers are wider, have the prescribed gradual incline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The city's speed-breakers, once infamous for being back breakers -in some instances even leading to fatal accidents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Others were in a sorry state, with rubberized speed-breakers on interior roads in localities like Besant Nagar and Thiruvanmiyur wearing away ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But a majority of Chennai's speed-breakers still do not conform to IRC norms.  Huge humps are still a menace in localities like T Nagar, Madipakkam and Anna Nagar. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In many cases, residents themselves have laid them so as to force vehicles to slow down and make their roads safer, to put up a speed-breaker of any shape just about anywhere. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Road experts and doctors say using such stretches of road on a daily basis could cause back and spine problems and other repetitive strain injuries while also damaging vehicles and making their maintenance a costly business. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But corporation officials say they plan to replace the faulty speed bumps with the new speed-breakers and motorists have welcomed the plan, having endured spine-janglers or much too long. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The corporation will next stall warning signs 40 metres ahead of all speed-breakers, an official said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The death of state food and cooperation minister Sellur K Raja's on, who fell from his motorbike after hit ing a speed bump in 2012 triggered the plan to re-do the city's speed-breakers.

 The corporation focused on interior roads so far and will now apply road science to speed-breakers on the 194 bus route roads that are being milled and relaid,"  he said """" We won't install speed-breakers on VIP routes such as Cathedral Road and Sardar Patel Road.

"Motorists say the new speed-breakers allow them to slow down gradually .  """" These speed-breakers have been installed on newly-laid roads and they make for a smooth ride",  says Karthik Sai, walkers cry for pavements to be reclaimed  COIMBATORE: Fitness enthusiasts in Coimbatore who love to take a walk or jog outdoors have to either wake up early and wind up their run by 7am or do it on the Race Course Road.  This is not because of the weather," but simply because they don't have anywhere to walk post 7am.  """" The city does not have well-built footpaths and so we are forced to run on the road.  This becomes impossible after 7am", except on Race Course Road, as traffic begins to grow,  says M Ramesh, a city-based marathon runner. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although, Coimbatore has many well-planned residential areas like those in R S Puram," not a single-one of them have well-planned pavement free from encroachment.  """" The pavements are hardly 3ft to 4ft wide and every 20 to 30 steps has either a sugarcane juice stall or two-wheelers parked",  said Ajit Kumar Jabakh," an avid walker and a member of the Mayflower Runners Club.  """" Uneven pavements make it difficult to walk on",  he added.  Recently," the Institute of Transport Development and Policy (ITDP) submitted a proposal to upgrade around 9km of footpaths spread across seven roads.  """" Some of the roads included in the proposal are VKK Menon Road off Gandhipuram", NSR Road in Saibaba Colony, D B Road and T V Samy Road in R S Puram, State Bank Road and Krishnasamy Road,  said Kashmira Medhora Dubhash, of ITDP, adding," """" we have chosen those stretches that extend from 1km to 1.8km and that have pavements but are not used by pedestrians due to certain issues",  she said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The problems are plenty -pavements being too narrow for two people to walk side-by-side, trees or electric junction boxes obstructing the pathway or damaged pavements that make it difficult for walkers. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to Indian Road Congress standards, a pavement needs to be clearly demarcated into three zones-the frontage zone," electricity junction boxes and transformer poles.  """" The pedestrian zone has to be at least 1.8-m to 2-m wide", so that a wheelchair can pass through comfortably and two people can walk side-by-side on an even platform without any obstruction,  said Dubhash. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The frontage zone that is to be 0.5m wide can accommodate spillover from shops,  she added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This model has been successful in several cities including Chennai where 18km of footpaths across 26 roads were upgraded.  """" In many areas like Besant Nagar", residents now want more footpaths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In fact," the city corporation was urged to get an expert in urban designing to help design the footpaths.  """" As architects", urban designer and partner of a Chennai-based architecture firm that had designed the Besant Nagar footpaths. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Folk images on modernist canvas  By M D Muthukumaraswamy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inside the tranquil Besant Nagar residence-cum-studio of K Muralidharan, his new modernist painting of the Vaishnavite poetess Andal startles you with its alluring imagery as a piece of folk art.  On a closer look at the familiar features of Andal -the side hair bun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Masked in crimson, a large peacock, and numerous little creatures divine and natural share their colours with the flower in Andal's hand.  When you realize that behind the painting's charm there lies a mastery of portraiture you begin to wonder whether the semblance of his works to folk arts is only a pretense.  Muralidharan says in one of his exhibition brochures, “I wouldn't call mine folk art, and it would be more appropriate to call it naïve art“. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The goddess Meenakshi painting shares several of the stylistic features of Andal but it appears to be more fantastic with Meenakshi's wild Medusa-like hair, and the hands making a magical appearance from the masked universe of the crimson background.  Comparing the paintings of Andal and Meenakshi one would discern that what Muralidharan calls his naiveté is actually an innocence with which he approaches his subjects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Muralidharan's present sets of paintings are, in fact, one can see his tendencies towards creating involved portraits and surfaces with rich textures. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Muralidharan says that his shift in the choice of themes occurred in the mid-1980s when he was visiting Hampi.  Sitting in the sprawling ruins of Hampi, Muralidharan decided that the conversation between conservation of tradition and chronicle of change would be integral to his paintings. He found the inventory of his fantasies in his immediate environment and neighbourhoods: the elephants of Thiruvallikeni temple, and animals, birds, and humans coexisting on the same plane. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In Muralidharan's paintings of the 1990s we see his impressionist portrayals of gods, goddesses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The artistic achievement of Muralidharan's present set of paintings is spectacular not only for himself but also for his methodological inheritance from the Madras school of art which set out to discover our cultural roots and their modern expressions.  Muralidharan's folkloric motifs, and the images of popular religious folklore such as goddess Lakshmi and Saraswati do not abandon the traditional decorative patterning but they reinvent them and reposition them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another characteristic of Muralidharan's paintings is that he does a series of paintings on the same subject.  Whether it is an elephant or a Kamadhenu, Muralidharan presents a set of variations on the same theme, continue to experiment, if I should be relevant and meaningful to the society I live in.  To me artistic achievement, success and being different is not a fixed point from where you can talk down to people.  It is a state of flux and I am part of it. “ The good news is that K Muralidharan's Andal is a masterpiece. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cook two extra meals, gently approaching the homeless people resting on the pavements.

âI had stupidly assumed that food is not a problem for poor people in Chennai as all religious institutions do annadanam.  Then I went for a drive with the Robin Hood Army and saw so many people sleeping hungry,â she says.  âThey donât have the facilities or ability to cook.  There are old people and those with leprosy. â Even if they were able to buy a small meal from a roadside stall, cooked with love and care. â,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The idea is simple: Take a walk through your locality and see how many homeless people are there.  If possible, try and engage in a conversation to see if they have eaten or not.

âPeople with leprosy cannot tear apart a chapathi,â says Bhuvana Rajaram, she and a few other people gather near the TTD temple and go through the area, distributing tamarind rice, lemon rice or curd rice, sometimes idli and sambar.  âWe network through a WhatsApp group,â she says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sneha Mohandoss,23, not many people came forward, but we have now done it 10 times and people are contributing,â says Ramdoss who started Food Bank Chennai, an initiative where people can share extra food.  âThis initiative, however, is more effective with people cooking fresh food just to feed the less privileged,â says Ramdoss, who handles Anna Nagar, Teynampet, and Nungambakkam on Thursdays and Saturdays. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More importantly, the volunteers feel that they themselves benefit from participating in the drive.  âI hate cooking and have a cook at home but I personally make these meals as tasty and nutritious as possible, arts, and politics. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
âChennai may not have the coffee house culture of Kolkata or the numerous durbars at homes of people with repute in Delhi where everyone is invited.  But people here gather in more private spaces at each otherâs homes in a personal capacity and almost all creative people host people.  But that is all in an informal way not leading to an intellectual debate,â says art critic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But others may disagree with the idea that these discussions are lightweight.  The argumentative Tamil has found in homes a venue for arguments for argumentsâ sake, creative stimulus and engagement with the community.  Late writer Jayakanthanâs home in KK Nagar was seen by many creative minds in the city as a place to wrestle with their thoughts and forge ideas.  In the evenings, actor Sreekanth and translator K S Subramanian would debate any topic, recollects Jayakanthanâs close associate and poet Ilayabharathi. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More than an âaddaâ, it was Jayakanthanâs âsabhaâ.  âIt was not really a discussion but an opportunity for us to listen to him talk.  Through these, and preserve Tamil culture,â says former vice-chancellor of Tamil university M Rajendran, a monthly visitor to the writerâs den since 1995. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A need for such a liberated environment probably came from Jayakanthanâs own experience in the late 1940s when he used to regularly meet communist stalwarts such as P Jeevanandam and garner ideas about world literature, culture and politics.  His association with them helped shape his thoughts and was reflected in his writings.  Later he took this concept of social gatherings to a room in Alwarpet where it was an open house and people would assemble every evening for a piece of Jayakanthanâs mind. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This kind of atmosphere of academic and literary discussion in Chennai has been sustained today by playwright Gnani Sankaran.  âIt was one in one such meeting that the idea for my theatre group Pareeksha was born.  These discussions also led to the protest against MGRâs world Tamil conference by writers and artists as it was seen as a politically motivated move,â says Gnani. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The playwright with his writer friend Bhaskar Shakthi has been holding meetings every month for the past six years at his home in K K Nagar.  The Keni meetings, as they are called, the actor Vinodhini performed a skit on her play.  So there are many impromptu acts,â says Gnani. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Areas like T Nagar, Nungambakkam High Road and Choolaimedu are hubs for transgender prostitution,â says Diya, who prefers to ask her customers if they are willing to take her to a decent place.

The sites identified are Race Course (2.56km), D B Road (1.6km), Sanganoor Road (2.6km) and Masakkalipalayam road (3.22km).  These footpaths will be continuous which means ramps would be set up in areas where there would be a cut road or a residence that would hinder the footpath.  This would enable even differently abled people to access them easily. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lawyer murder on ECR: Cops probe role of another gangster  CHENNAI: Police suspect the involvement of a north Chennai gang in the murder of lawyer Kamesh Srinivasan, who was shot dead near Mamallapuram on Monday.  Police have included the name of another lawyer, âSamboâ Senthil, in the first information report (FIR) and launched a hunt for him. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Senthil is a close relative of a gangster in north Chennai.  The Mamallapuram police had arrested Eshwaran, a client of Kamesh, was killed when he was returning from Puducherry with Eshwaran.  Like Kameshâs family members, police personnel probing the case are also not convinced by Eshwaranâs version of the story that he accidentally pulled the trigger of the pistol, sending a bullet through Kameshâs lower abdomen. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The investigation officer said Kamesh was known for his proximity to criminals.  Eshwaran was involved in two murder cases.  They had gone to meet another âclientâ in Puducherry to settle a deal there. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police said Kamesh worked as a junior lawyer to âSamboâ Senthil for some time before he started on his own.  As more criminals shifted their allegiance from Senthil to Kamesh, Senthil turned jealous.  This may have provoked him to eliminate Kamesh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kamesh often appeared for another rowdy of north Chennai, and the dispute between two rowdy groups may have also triggered the lawyerâs killing.

A patient ear is all it takes for better bonding with kids  CHENNAI: Why does teenage create a dizzy among parents? Is it because they feel âalienatedâ from their childâs life? Or is it because they havenât learnt to let go? âAnxiousâ parenting versus âchillâ parenting can be a problem says Dr Vijay Nagaswami, at a panel discussion with educationist Uma Shanker on Sunday.  The discussion on Introspecting Respect,â says Nagaswami, a psychiatrist, therapist and author.  According to him, parents need to master the art of listening.  âThey need to focus on listening, engaging and coaching.  They must talk to their children and not lecture them,â he says.  Whether its sex, drugs or dating, an open, non-judgmental talk with children on taboo topics is crucial especially when biology classes on sex education suck out the romance from lovemaking, says Nagaswami and adds, that it is the parents who need to move from a âno sexâ to the âsafe sexâ approach.  The next big question is: Does the teenage package include responsibility? âA responsible teenager is an oxymoron! But to inculcate responsibility, parents need to set certain ground rules like no drugs or self-harm,â says Nagaswami, adding that explaining the reason for such rules is essential.  Traditionally, children are taught to ârespect elders. â One of the first sayings they learn is âGive respect, take respect. â But usually, the first half of this saying falls flat in parent-child interactions.  âRespect starts from infancy and how attentive parents are to varied expressions of the child,â says Uma Shanker, who has over 30 years of experience in the Montessori method of education, adding that parents must legitimise a babyâs cry by giving it vocals rather than stop it from expressing emotions.  Her role play on how gadgets have snapped the bond between parents and children struck a chord with the audience.  Shanker says parents need to be watchful of their tone and body language as children pick up on emotions quickly.  âUsually, children have all those characteristics that adults aspire to have.  They have an infinite capacity to forgive and be compassionate.  If we listen to them carefully, we can learn a lot from them,â explains Shanker.

Hawkers are an integral part of any city but the corporation is yet to constitute a Town Vending Committee (TVC) to regulate vendors despite the Supreme Court passing an order to this effect in September 2013. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Lok Sabha passed the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Bill on September 6 and, three days later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Civic bodies in cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune have already constituted TVCs to demarcate hawking spaces and prevent encroachments. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officials admit that the city has 3,966 registered hawkers but more than 1 lakh operate without licences. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Madras high court last Tuesday asked the civic body to make the busy stretch of between Parry’s Corner and Flower Bazaar police station on NSC Bose Road a no-hawking zone in accordance with the apex court order.  But hawkers have encroached on footpaths on several roads in Purasawalkam, Royapuram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“The pavements got wider but now hawkers have set up shop so one has to walk on the road,” said Ram Kumar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The width of road shrunk after the corporation widened the pavement, resulting in traffic congestion. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corporation officials say they have not received any instructions from the state government on formation of TVCs.  They say they designed the newly widened pavements so they can accommodate pedestrians, vendors and utility cables. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National Association of Street Vendors of India executive committee member V Maheswaran said the authorities may have vested reasons for delaying the formation of a TVC. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Politicians and officials may not able to take money once the corporation forms a TVC,” he said.  “Many hawkers facing harassment from officials and pay them bribes to do business. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every Friday, she ensures it is a balanced meal, complete with rice, dal and veggies.  As dusk falls, she joins a band of volunteers who walk through the streets of Chennai's Besant Nagar," handing out packets of food to the homeless.  """" There are about 15 to 20 of us", and on an average, we distribute about 70 packets,"  says the 34-year-old.  """" It's a simple thing to do but can make a huge difference to someone out there. """"  The price of pulses is soaring and everyone in India is feeling the pinch.  But in Chennai", people are getting together to ensure the homeless don't go hungry at night.

"""" I had stupidly assumed that food is not a problem for poor people in Chennai as all religious institutions do annadanam","  she says.  A drive with the Robin Hood Army -a volunteer-driven NGO - opened her eyes.  """" There are many homeless people who don't have the facilities or ability to cook.  There are people with leprosy and old people who have no motor skills",  she says.  Aarti began making sambar sadam for five people.  When she posted it on Facebook, she was deluged with queries from people who wanted to know how they could help.  Today, there are groups across the city who serve the homeless in their respective localities.  Each group does the drive on a specific day of the week.  People can join the group as they go about distributing food or drop it off at a common point.  Sometimes," volunteers collect the food from people's homes.  """" Whoever is free to do it comes along.  We ask people to keep the food ready by 7pm and start distributing it by 8pm",  says Archana.

The initiative encourages people to share extra food made in their homes, says Sneha, who runs her own event management company.  Despite rising food prices, people are still willing to make that extra portion," say volunteers.  """" It is the time and effort involved in distributing it that often poses a problem", especially as the majority of the volunteers are women,  says Bhuvana.  Her initiative has also spread to other parts of the country, thanks to social media.  'Food Bank -Chennai' now has branches in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, and Faridabad.  In a bid to simplify logistics and improve nutrition levels," Aarti launched 'Fruit on Friday' last month.  The initiative encourages people to give a fruit to an underprivileged person every Friday.  """" Poor people do not buy fruits", and lack of adequate nutrition renders them more vulnerable to illness,  writes Aarti on the group's FB page.  The initiative has already caught on, with people posting photos and videos.

And the rain predicted for Saturday could make things messier.  Overflowing dustbins on sub-arterial roads such as Kalakshetra Road raise the risk of a disease outbreak.  Lime bleach powder sprayed around dustbins on Thursday was not seen on Friday.  The corporation park on Sivasundar Avenue 2 {+n} {+d} Street has been flooded since rain started a month ago.

Nowhere to drain: Shoreline under water  CHENNAI: It's bad news for those living along the south eastern coast.  They will have to live amid the stagnant pools of water brought by the record spells of rain over the past few weeks as there is no way for the water to drain.  The water table along the Thiruvanmiyur", Kottivakkam and Neelankarai beaches is already so high that water on the surface cannot percolate.  While most residents in some of these localities have been living amid the pools since the torrential rain began more than two weeks ago a few of them had to shift to areas in the core city.  The situation, experts warn, will continue for some more time and the residents will have to wait until the water seeps into the soil naturally.  Even when water was being drained out of low-lying areas such as Velachery," residents of some coastal areas didn't have a breather and the continued rain only compounded the issue.  """" Water can be drained to nearby aquifers in Velachery but in localities along the east coast", water will continue to stagnate even if there are drains because it has gone above the saturation level,"  said marine biologist T D Babu.  These are localities that don't have a storm water drain system yet.  """" A drain system wouldn't help this place either.  It would in fact be detrimental to the process of recharging groundwater.  This is a rare phenomenon along this stretch of the coast","  he said.  Corporation workers have been using earthmovers and laying wet mixes on streets that remain under water.  """" East Coast Road has sandy soil which absorbs water so we didn't think the situation would be like this","  said a senior Metrowater official.  """" When the downpour began", water entered even our bathrooms, so we shifted to homes of relatives in the centre of the city.  We came back home a week later only to find the same level of water stagnated,  said a Palavakkam resident seeking anonymity.  Surprisingly," people living in houses opposite Elliot's beach in Besant Nagar do not face such a situation as the houses are on higher ground.  """" Development has not been as fast in Besant Nagar as on ECR where several coastal regulatory zone norms are violated","  said Babu.

Ramkumar is one of a special tribe of people - lensmen, priests, make-up artists, caterers - that was active during the first week of December.  Chennai was locked down but the weddings couldn't be cancelled and photographers were as much a part of these weddings as the bride and the groom.  To some, a wedding celebration this week in Chennai may have looked as surreal as the orchestra playing on the 'Titanic' when it was going under.  But the flood will recede and the skies will clear up, and families would have lost lakhs of rupees," relatives would have had to come back again and intimate family moments would have been lost if the weddings had to be postponed.  """" I was only doing my job by getting to the venue","  said Ramkumar.  """" Yes it rained", and yes we went ahead with the marriage,  was the reaction of most families TOI spoke to.  They added they owe it to those who ensured the day was special.  Malathi, of Virugambakkam, spent last month preparing for her brother's December 2 wedding.  She was sure there would be a few watery moments, but the amount of water astonished her, she says.  Her family had spent more than Rs 4 lakh - 5 lakh on the wedding -- for the halls, the caterers and the decoration.  They were expecting nearly 400 people, but only 60-70 people turned up.  She says the wedding caterers had only brought enough food for the first day, the day of the reception.  They had to use the same ingredients the next day and tweak it for variety in the wedding menu.  Though the weddings were washouts," the brides and grooms didn't let that dampen spirits.  """" Flooded wedding! I never thought I will experience one.  It was a complete washout but it had its own charm.  My make-up was fine but My new sari was wet since the rainwater had come inside the marriage hall.  I was feeling awkward", was wondering if my husband was looking better, but I was surprised to see his new trousers rolled up too,  says Megna from Besant Nagar.  Santhosh Kumar and his bride Dhivya may not have been big fans of 'janavasam' - the ritual the day before the wedding when the groom rides a convertible and comes in a procession.  They dispensed with the car ride but the fun was not to be missed.  The newly-wed couple, in all their bejewelled glory, needed a boat to leave the wedding hall.  Kamini, who landed here from the US for her marriage," had her plans and dreams sorted.  """" I got married in Tiruneermalai temple.  My hubby and I wanted to feel positive and optimistic.  Every time I saw my friend's face"," I realised how important I was to them since very few skipped the event. """"  Forty-five year-old Veera Raghavan of Mylapore took nearly four hours to reach Velachery on December 1 for a wedding.  The priest says he's officiated for almost 40 weddings"," but this one was his most memorable.  """" I had many near-death experiences while going to marriage halls.

The couple thanked Yunus by naming their daughter after him, with the businessman now promising to take care of his namesake's educational expenses. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Narrating the experience, Yunus said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The screams of a woman in the area initially sounded like a frightened reaction to Yunus and his friends," but """" later I realised she was undergoing labour pain"""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 At first, my objective was to take her and the family to a safer place and we moved her to nearby Perungalathur by boat.  That 15-minute journey is unforgettable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, he got the surprise of his life when Mohan informed him that he has named his daughter Yunus. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a text message to Yunus, Mohan informed him of the birth of his daughter and his decision to name her after the Muslim postgraduate. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We take pride in this,  Mohan had told him. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having himself been a victim of a disaster, Mohan has vowed to contribute 50% of his salary for the needy. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asked whether he had time to pay a visit to the child, Yunus said he was still helping those affected with his 15- member team. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fear of infections haunts elderly in city post floods  When a disaster strikes, children, pregnant women, the elderly and those who are ill are particularly vulnerable to infections and take a relatively high share of the disease burden associated with emergencies.  And now that the floods have receded, one of the biggest worries that people, especially the frail and elderly, have to grapple with is the spread of infections. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ramamurthy,97, live alone in their ground floor apartment in T Nagar.  When the flood water entered their house," they could not escape as they had no place to go and had to bear the stench and mosquito menace.  """" For the past week", it feels like we've been living on an island.  The government must remove the sewage water immediately,  says Ramamurthy. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Confined to their residence, the couple fear they may contract infections due to the stagnant water mixed with sewage seeping into their home. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Our drinking water has a bad smell.  With the help of neighbours, we have stocked up on medicines and food.  We have closed all our doors because of the mosquito menace,  he added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The locality's welfare association says that though local councillors and MLAs met the old couple," no action has been taken.  """" Living here is dangerous.  A family with a four-month-old baby also lives here but at least they have been able to take refuge at a relative's residence", he added.  Another nonagenarian, Kesavan*,92, who is recovering from an illness, has also been left in the lurch, as there is knee deep contaminated water at the entrance of his first floor residence in Besant Nagar.  Several commercial establishments and residents affected here have made complaints to Metrowater, Corporation of Chennai," ward councillors and MLAs but it has gone in vain.  """" The water has been stagnant for more than 10 days and it even entered our staircase.  We are really worried about falling sick",  said Kesavan's wife. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, The Senior Citizens Group of Besant Nagar (SCGOBN) has been collecting and distributing old clothes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Water has been stagnating in the streets since it rained during Diwali and now the entire locality is flooded,” said secretary of the residents’ welfare association P Natarajan. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We have been working with corporation staff and pumping out water, but water from multiple sources keeps ending up here and the problem continues.  We take turns daily to take a day off from work and pump out the water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The protest was held before the residents went to work and college.  “The place stinks as well because sewage has been leaking.  Metrowater and the corporation need to coordinate better so that we do not suffer,” he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Several localities are still waterlogged and sewage has mixed with floodwater in many neighbourhoods causing infections and severe mosquito menace.  In Besant Nagar, 7th Avenue despite repeated calls for help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“A couple in their 90s haven’t been able to come out of their home for two weeks because sewage has leaked into the stagnant water,” said a shopowner on the street.  “My textile shop has been destroyed.  There was a drain here which was blocked after they widened the pavement.  That led to the waterlogging.  We have made several calls to the corporation, losing textbooks, notes and record books apart from three weeks of classes.  With syllabi remaining incomplete, this would adversely affect preparations of students appearing for the board exams this year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Students from slums will not be able to afford private tuition classes.  We can't blame the schools; hence we are reaching out to relatives and friends who can take tuitions at a convenient time and place for these children,  said Professor V Chandrasekhar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly , officials of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) of the Chennai division have selected a few schools in Vyasarpadi and Perambur where their volunteers will take classes in subjects like Maths and Science for Class 10 students. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 We have been allotted one classroom by school authorities.  Tuitions will be given by family members and friends of railway officials on a daily basis,  said KK Ashraf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of these volunteer-teachers are also graduates in psychology and can counsel students traumatised by the floods so that they can conduct the classes in a relaxed manner, Ashraf said.

Failure of corporation and metrowater leaves residents fuming  CHENNAI: A combined failure of the city corporation and Metrowater has left Kalakshetra Colony and surrounding areas in a mess, has been blocked since November as workers are pumping out water from a blocked storm water drain into another drain across the street.  Several manholes are overflowing with sewage and a dug-up trench, the size of a single cot, has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, residents say, adding that the agencies concerned have done little apart from blaming each other.  Some residents even staged a ‘road roko’ but in vain.  “Mosquito menace is the main issue,” said Lakshmi Sundaram, a resident.  “We didn’t have any problems till the trench was dug up.  Workers are pumping water from other apartments into this trench flooding our street.  The trench serves no purpose as it isn’t connected to any water or sewage network but authorities aren’t closing it. ” Officials building a drain on the stretch had to leave it half done in 2012 when Vice-President Hamid Ansari visited the Kalakshetra Foundation started by the legendary Rukmini Devi Arundale, say residents.  “Two people on their bikes fell down near the trench as there was only one barricade,” said Anuradha Ramakrishnan, another resident.  On-going work has made the road inaccessible.  “For more than a month, we have been taking a detour to LB road,” said an auto driver.  Water from LIC Colony, Sriram Nagar and RK Nagar is being pumped from inside the drain.  “This drain is blocked and water is overflowing from manholes,” said a corporation engineer.  “So we are taking water to the other side of the road where water flows smoothly into drains.  If we stop doing this, the roads will get flooded.  We are getting a contractor to dig up the place and repair the blocks in the drains. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  15 dead Olive Ridleys on city beaches worry conservationists  CHENNAI: In a worrying sign for conservationists, 15 Olive Ridley turtles, an endangered species, have washed ashore dead on Chennai beaches ahead of the nesting season.  “There were 11 along Marina beach and four on Elliot’s Beach,” said Shravan Krishnan, a volunteer with Student Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finding so many dead turtles even before nesting has begun is not good, say conservationists.  “Last year,” said SSTCN coordinator V Arun. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The forest department has set up hatcheries near Broken Bridge in Adyar trained more than 60 rangers from nine coastal districts on tracking turtle nests and their relocation as well as on data collection.  “Now, there are hatcheries in Besant Nagar and at Kovalam in Kancheepuram district.  Over the next few weeks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trawlers are the biggest threat to turtles.  They often get entangled in the nets and the trawler operator just cut off the flippers as untangling is time-consuming and expensive.  Turtles, which have to come up for air every 30mins to 40mins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The artificial lights on roads lining city beaches are another problem.  In natural conditions, turtles that have just hatched would drift to the sea but artificial lights on the opposite side draw them towards land where they are either eaten by dogs and crows or die of dehydration.  Baby turtles have about 48 hours of food supplies when they hatch. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This year, the tonnes of garbage washed up on the beaches after the floods threatened to disrupt the natural nesting process of Olive Ridleys but hundreds of volunteers got together to clear the beaches — making it possible for turtles to nest again. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turtles, which have being nesting along the country’s coast for 110 million years, you will hear an announcement about the next bus stop. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don’t be surprised by this, as it is a new Global Positioning System-based announcement made available in 20 buses, and 47 Besant Nagar – Villivakkam routes.  Five buses in each route will have the new facility, the officer said.  After the announcement, the passengers will be treated to a film song.  Once the bus reaches the next stop, the song will be muted, for the announcement.  “This is done to help the passengers alight at the right stops,” the officer says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Right now, the system is on trial in the 20 buses.  Once the testing is complete, there is some problem with the software and this is affecting the announcement.  “We are looking at the problematic ones and the software issues will be sorted out soon,” and soon it will be alright,” the officer says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GPS-based facility will allow more passenger-friendly announcements in future.  For example, the time at which the vehicle will reach the next stop can be announced.  Information on the operational route of the buses, especially for tourists and elderly people, a commuter says.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Death in nesting season The nesting season of Olive Ridley turtles has begun on a death note. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About 250 dead turtles have been washed ashore along the 100-km stretch of East Coast from Besant Nagar in the city to Madhuranthagam in Kancheepuram district. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The past three to four years have witnessed too many deaths of the sea turtles,” says Arun of Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The student volunteer network that has been patrolling the city’s beaches from the late 1980s found 65 dead turtles since the New Year’s day. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tree Foundation volunteers are involved in conservation of the critically endangered turtles from Neelankarai to Marakkanam.  “Almost 123 dead turtles were washed ashore between December 20 and January 13,” says Supraja Dharini of the foundation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On Saturday alone, more than 60 turtles were ashore dead from Neelankarai to Alambarai.  Conservationists say that the main reason for such high sea turtle mortality is due to commercial trawl fishing nets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The turtles need to come to the surface of the sea every 40-45 minutes to breathe.  Trapped in the fishing net, they can’t come up.  Once the net is raised,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Many of the dead turtles are washed deep into the sea as well,” says Mr.  Arun.  Local fishermen have also been reporting that they have observed many dead turtles floating in the sea this season. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The conservationists have been waging a relentless war with the State government for years now for a law to ban the killer nets like in many western countries.  A week ago, the Fisheries Department held a meeting with the fishermen. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fishermen were told to fish beyond five km from the shore and boat owners were asked to instruct the workers not to fish in regions off shore to estuaries.  They were also asked to pull up their nets every one hour. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a major step towards conservation of the city’s flagship species, the Fisheries Department in association with the Tree Foundation will be organising a demonstration of the Turtle Excluder Device (TED) next week for all the trawl boat owners. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scientists from Central Institute of Fisheries Technology will display indigenously designed TED to the boat owners.  “TEDs are low-cost devices and the loss will only be marginal,” says Mr.  Arun.

A press release said areas such as Adyar, Velachery, Neelankarai, Sholinganallur, Kottivakkam, Palavakkam and Perungudi will be supplied from other water sources.

C. R. , Neelankarai, Sholinganallur).  Commuters stumped by new bus numbers Commuters in south Chennai were in for a shock when they noticed Metropolitan Transport Corporation buses (MTC) with unfamiliar route numbers on Tuesday. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kalyani Vijayaraghavan, a resident of K. K.  Nagar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She said that MTC should have properly informed commuters about the changes to route numbers which were effected from Tuesday. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Similarly, confusion prevailed on Rajiv Gandhi Salai in the morning as commuters wondered where their regular T51 bus was.  The route number plying instead was 95.  Many commuters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In East Tambaram bus terminus, however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the route numbers that gave way to new ones on Tuesday include 21H (102), T21 (102K), and it took a few weeks for commuters to get used to them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MTC officials maintained that these changes were made in accordance with the areas from where the buses originate.  For example, buses from Adyar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“These are some of the problems that occur whenever we introduce a new system.  We have informed depots and arranged for a public address system to inform the commuters about these changes, wherever possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He added that stickers have been pasted on the windscreens to inform commuters about the change.  Millets on the menu for the health conscious It is not as if millets as a food group conventionally evokes the idea of a mouth-watering meal, let alone something worth paying for.  However,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prem’s Graama Bhojanam (PGB) in Adyar is arguably the city’s first restaurant to offer a platter of rural dishes prepared exclusively from millets. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Samai kuzhipaniyaaram, varagu idli, kavuni idiyappam, samai thayir sadham and thoothuvalai rasam saadham are some of the dishes they offer. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its founder N. S Krishnamoorthi, who has worked in the food industry with Hindustan Lever for over three decades, ” he says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None the less, the demand has been heartening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Without investing in heavy advertising, Krishnamurthi has managed to attract a wide clientele of young professionals, Zomato and food groups on Facebook” he says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer Institute: Thanksgiving Day, Dr. S. Krishnamurthi campus, 5.30 p. m.  40 bus routes to get priority makeover Following persistent delays in shifting of utilities by line agencies, the Chennai Corporation has decided to prioritise the makeover of 40 bus routes, likely to be frequented by delegates of the Global Investors’ Meet in May. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘Legal challenges’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The work order was delayed because of various legal challenges.  The line agencies are yet to complete digging work.  We will complete work on 40 important roads by May 15,” said an official. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The roads include stretches leading up to heritage sites, the Secretariat, the airport and port.  The civic body has issued work order for 194 roads, and they will have better pedestrian facilities, including zebra crossing and footpaths. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Corporation has planned to reduce the number of roads covered under the project following a study of pavement conditions done using advanced technology. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-invasive technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After screening 197 roads using non-invasive technology, a private agency has recommended shelving of work on some roads that are in good condition. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“This is the first time roads are getting a makeover based on analysis of data collected using non-invasive technology,” said an official. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kamarajar Salai in Virugambakkam, 3{+r}{+d}Main Road in Besant Nagar and Water Tank Road in Arumbakkam are among the roads found to be in good condition. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No relaying work will be taken up on such roads, officials added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“A few of the roads relaid two years ago were included in the list generated for relaying,” said an official. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In addition to shelving some road work, the civic body is also likely to postpone work on 50 roads because of digging of roads for fault rectification by Tangedco.  Metrowater will also dig 10 of the roads.  Relaying will begin only after completion of the work. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By July, the civic body will relay all 194 bus route roads.  The new roads will be ready before the monsoon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peak hour charges irk cab commuters Trying to book a call taxi during peak hours? You might want to keep an eye on the meter to see how much they are charging you.  Most call-taxi services in the city are now levying ‘peak hour charges’ which are much higher than regular charges of the taxi service. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For many passengers, the final bill comes as a shock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R.  Christina, a resident of Besant Nagar who frequently uses call taxis, they all charge around double of the normal rates,” she says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even haggling with autorickshaws works out cheaper, during the peak hours from 7 a. m.  to 10 a. m. , and even on their websites, many cab services do not mention a peak hour charge.  It is only at the end of the trip we know how much we have been charged,” she says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to M.  Anand, orthopaedic surgeon at Fortis Malar, there were multiple fractures to her toes, and her big toe was crushed.

The other toes were bound with plaster of Paris, he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was also a minor blood clot on Sandhya’s left leg which is being treated with ice packs and medication.  “She is doing well and is stable now,” said Dr.  Anand. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“The building housing the water motor was dilapidated and believed to be constructed in the late 70s.

Dr.  Anand said the entire healing process could take two to three months, after which she can return to school.  Peak hour charges irk cab commuters Trying to book a call taxi during peak hours? You might want to keep an eye on the meter to see how much they are charging you.  Most call-taxi services in Chennai are now levying ‘peak hour charges’ which are much higher than regular charges of the taxi service. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For many passengers, the final bill comes as a shock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R.  Christina, a resident of Besant Nagar who frequently uses call taxis, they all charge around double of the normal rates,” she says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even haggling with autorickshaws works out cheaper, during the peak hours from 7 a. m.  to 10 a. m. , and even on their websites, many cab services do not mention a peak hour charge.  It is only at the end of the trip we know how much we have been charged,” she says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the government has been planning to fix the rates, nothing has happened so far.  “We are currently working on a plan to ensure both autorickshaw drivers and call-taxi drivers can survive together.

Commuters look forward to more airconditioned buses to beat the heat. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As on date, Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) operates 100 airconditioned buses.  However, for better revenue. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Due to this there are no such buses connecting destinations within the city.  Commuters have no option but to bear the heat,” says J.  Shanmugavelu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commuters want MTC to increase the number of airconditioned buses on routes that have malls and other places of entertainment, as it is holiday season.  “There should also be such buses from and to Chennai Central and Koyambedu bus terminus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She says the Chennai Corporation should also install proper shelters at bus stops.  “In many places, there is no roof.

Trained at the K. K.  Nagar-based institution Kidobotikz, these children have worked for weeks to create the fully-functional robot that has participated in various beach clean-up events.

However, the Kidobotikz stars have bigger plans.  While the robot segregates the garbage to a point,” she says.  In search of the Pride of Madras If you know of any senior citizens in the city who have made a difference to society, or have gone beyond the call of duty to bring pride to Chennai, be sure to nominate them for the ‘Pride of Madras’ awards. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The presentation of the awards, instituted by the Senior Citizens Group of Besant Nagar, president of the association, said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nominations may be sent to Mr.  Chandrasekhar atseniorcitizensofbesantnaga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
r@gmail. com or by hard copy to B 12/12, 25th cross, you would not have missed the difference from say, a year ago.  The beach, which was like any other in the city – badly maintained with garbage strewn everywhere — seems to have been transformed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The difference is especially noticeable considering the fact that the two iconic beaches of the city, the Marina and Elliots Beach in Besant Nagar are prime examples of poor maintenance. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cleaning drives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Walkers associations and social activists in Thiruvanmiyur had been trying for long improve the civic condition of the beach by installing seating facilities for the public and organising cleaning drives. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, their efforts got a major boost when a private company Rialto adopted the beach under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E.  Senthil Murugan, who works in the company and is involved in the CSR initiative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He says that by involving the Chennai Corporation and private conservancy operator Ramky, garbage collection has been fully streamlined. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oher benefits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other benefits from the adoption have been the greening of the beach by watering the avenue trees, installing tree guards and re-arranging and repairing the concrete benches,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chanderswamy, who initiated the CSR activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He adds that by bringing all the stakeholders including the civic body and the private conservancy operator into the picture, the beach has become a paradise for walkers.  No single technique will do t is no longer about rainwater harvesting.  It is about applying the right harvesting technique in a given situation.  According to a study conducted by Rain Centre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The study has divided the city into four recharge zones, based on soil formation and recharge potential. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to the study, areas along the coast and river banks such as Besant Nagar, Royapuram, Spurtank Road and Gandhi Nagar have the potential to recharge every drop of rainwater that falls on their soil.  Besides sandy soil, these areas also have a low water table before the onset of the monsoon, which favours faster percolation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The study has urged residents to ensure utmost harnessing of rainwater at their houses, including driveway runoffs.  It has asked the government to dig recharge wells along road margins to replenish groundwater.  Recharge wells dug on the roadside at Kalakshetra Colony, parts of West Mambalam, Kilpauk and Ayanavaram fall under recharge zone II, which is characterised by sandy soil, but has a high water table. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, areas that have clayey soil and rocky terrain need a different rainwater harnessing technique to sustain groundwater source. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr.  Raghavan said these areas, with their clayey soil are categorised as recharge zone III,” he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are certain other areas in the city where harnessing rainwater may prove difficult owing to rocky terrain, says the study.  In areas such as Little Mount, Alandur and St.  Thomas Mount, residents may have to put up a combination of a recharge well and a borewell pit. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Rain Centre also plans to survey rainwater harvesting structures and provide suggestions to residents.  People may either contact the Centre on ph: 24918415 or 9677043869, or the Chennai Metrowater at ph: 28454080 and 45674567 to clarify doubts on the maintenance of such structures.

“Stopping the screening of the film based on a law written in 1957 is highly objectionable.

Bharathi from Besant Nagar would drop her son at pre-school, she would notice the other parents speaking fluent, flawless English.  Unable to fully join in their conversation, she decided to enroll in an English class. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“I realised the importance of studying English, not only to speak,” Bharathi said.  Like her, many adults are moving away from merely picking up tips on spoken English to learning the language as a whole, experts say. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to Vijaya Srinivasa, senior assessment services manager, people are slowly realising there is no place where only spoken English can be used.  “Every opportunity to speak English needs you to listen, understand, and possibly even send emails.  Just learning a few ‘important’ phrases in English is not enough,” she said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even institutes that used to offer spoken English classes seem to have changed their focus, and are offering English as a language.  “Over the past five or six years, and where they need to improve,” she added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to Judy Selvam, senior Manager, who has been running their adult English courses for the past six years, there has been a significant increase in the number of adults opting to learn English.  “While a majority of our learners are engineering students, we also get a significant number of housewives, business people and people in mid-career,” she said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each one comes to learn English for a different reason.  “While homemakers want to be able to teach their children, people who have successful businesses come in so they can expand their knowledge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British Council offers five levels of English, based on an initial assessment that they conduct of the students.  They also offer students the option of General English, IELTS preparation, teacher training and short workshops.  “We ensure that along with speaking, all our students learn the basics of functional grammar, and how to communicate in different scenarios,” she said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to learning the language as a whole Football gains ground in Chennai n 2011, Slum Soccer operated from a poky little office on Lazarus Church Road at Santhome. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Four years on, it functions at an office on First Cross Street,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Football in Chennai has many things going for it.  With the advent of the Indian Super League (ISL), the city’s youngsters now have footballers with a ‘glocal’ identity as idols.  Chennaiyin FC, whipping up a passion for the sport.  Many schools are holding football academies, some of which are helmed by former footballers.  Facilities for football keep coming up, sometimes in unbelievably attractive ways. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R.  Mohanakrishnan, who was goalkeeper to Tamil Nadu in many a national football tournament between 1964 and 1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Besides students at this institution, children from other Corporation schools are brought to this ground and coached in football,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Individually, retired footballers are holding coaching programmes. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The demand for coaching is the result of an increase in football tournaments for youngsters, especially schoolgoers.  In fact,’ it seeks to identify promising footballers under the age of 15 by casting the net across 650 schools in 15 Indian cities. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to a press release by the organisers, the programme is expected to reach 4, 16 will be sent to Spain to cut their football teeth with the advantage of having international coaches, it adds. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Akshay Vishnu Madhavan, chief operating officer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Earlier, if we missed a few days and went back, we see them still playing football,” says Mr.  Madhavan. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that football is being used as a tool for social reform is what is partly helping it expand in the city. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Benefits of the Slum Soccer programmes are evident to everyone.  The children are given addiction awareness, environmental awareness and they are taught financial literacy, a factor that indirectly helps the sport. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Street children are also touched by reform programmes centred on football. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For them, the zenith is participation in what is called the Street Child World Cup and the hope of a better future. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The last edition of the Steet Child World Cup, which takes place once in four years and follows the FIFA World Cup,” says Paul Sunder Singh, secretary of Karunalaya. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Street Child Football is aimed at challenging the negative perceptions about street children, make them aware of their rights and help them overcome negative traits and imbibe noble values,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A synergistic approach among NGOs working in this space seems to be contributing to the effectiveness of social exercises carried out with the help of football. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We associate with Slum Soccer, because they help us identify the children who could be part of the programme.  They conduct tournaments for our children.  Sometime ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the end of the day, what warms the heart is that there are no losers.  Only winners.  One of those winners towers over the rest — that is the sport of football. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Football has proved to be an effective tool for social transformation Chennai today RELIGION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advocate shot dead by client in Chennai 34-year-old advocate was allegedly shot dead by his client, Eesa alias Eswaran, a history-sheeter, in Mahabalipuram on Sunday night. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police claim they have nabbed Eswaran who has been previously involved in many other murder cases. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The victim Kamesh, an advocate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to his brother-in-law Dhinakaran, a doctor, speaking to The Hindu. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After this, he called his wife around 9.30 p. m.  and told her that he was nearing Mahabalipuram and that he would call back in an hour.  “Around midnight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Selvam told the family that Kamesh, who had rung him around 10.30 p. m. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We tried getting some CCTV footages from the toll gates on ECR, but it can be obtained only with police permission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sources say that Kamesh was shot on his left leg and the bullet has passed out from the right hip.  “Kamesh did not own a gun.  We suspect it belongs to Eswaran.  But we want the police to thoroughly investigate this case as something seems to be fishy here,” said Kamesh’s father Srinivasan. Kamesh’s friends who were shocked on hearing about his death arrived at the mortuary.  “He has been practicing law for the past four years and was initially a junior lawyer helping many senior advocates before he began working independently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile the post mortem was completed and the body was handed over to the family in the evening.  The Mahabalipuram police have registered a case and are investigating the same.  “Eswaran initially said that he shot Kamesh by accident near Mahabalipuram, but later he said that he committed the crime in Marakkanam near Puducherry.  We are investigating this angle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Statistics of National Crime Records Bureau may project Chennai to be safe with very few cases under the Arms Act when compared to other metro cities. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But, Sunday’s shooting in Mahabalipuram with 9 mm pistol is a cause of concern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only five incidents under the Arms Act have been recorded in Chennai during 2014, however Bangalore has 15, in Tamil Nadu a total of 275 cases have been reported under the Act and 172 arms have been seized during the same year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though sale of guns in the city is not easy, senior police officers suspect that the weapons may have been smuggled from Northern States.  “On Sunday,” said a police source.  According to the source, there are country-made guns available in northern India that can fire 9 mm bullets.  “But the projectiles cannot be locally made.  It can be purchased only from ordinance factories.  In case the lawyer was shot with such a cartridge, it should have been stolen or procured from the black market.  Such bullets are available in Maharashtra, and must have come from there,” he added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides, other officers feel that it is not easy to fire such guns without proper training.  “There have been unconfirmed reports of guns being hidden inside logs and smuggled into the state from North India.  We are investigating such reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Church, Moolakadai; and The Lady of the Light Church, Luz Church Rd. , Mylapore, 7 p. m.  For these youths, Ultimate Frisbee is a game changer When 22-year-old Praveen Kumar first showed his friends a flying disc, they thought it was a plate.  Now, Praveen and his friends travel the world to play Ultimate Frisbee.  Praveen, from Urur Kuppam, is one of eight players from Besant Nagar to represent India at the World Under-23 Ultimate Championship in London.  The team, which was trained by an Australian coach, finished ninth.  The eight youngsters are from a modest background. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The trip to London was sponsored by two corporate firms.  Crowd-funding helped meet a part of the expenses.  “Ultimate Frisbee is now a serious sport.  It is now recognised by the International Olympic Council.  The sponsors want to see results,” says Manu Karan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For Praveen and Ramakrishnan N. ,21, these youngsters have developed social skills and self-confidence.  It has also meant respect in the eyes of their family.  M.  Ganesan, also from Urur Kuppam, says, “Initially, my parents would ask me to not waste time at the beach.  Now, they are my fans.  When I went to Dubai for a tournament, my entire family came over to see me off.  When I got selected for the tournament at London, their joy was boundless. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Frisbee has become a vital part of Besant Nagar and has had an impact on many lives and not just on the players.  Local vendors get business during these tournaments.  It has brought people from different walks of life together.  So many people — from the elaneer seller to staff of the neighbouring restaurants — play the sport,” says Manu.

Ramachandran founded the party in 1972. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The outreach programme, dubbed ‘My Leader’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The elections are around the corner and a significant percentage of voters are going to be first timers.  We thought it only makes sense to address them directly,” said a member of the AIADMK’s IT wing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Renowned drummer ‘Drums’ Kumaran opened the act along with a beat boxer as he went through what has become the usual routine: western beats punctuated by local Chennai rhythm. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Pallavaram-based hip hop group then took the spotlight as they broke into a dance to ‘Billy Jean’ and other hits in front of a sizable crowd. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the performance, the cadres of the AIADMK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The event, organised by the party’s IT wing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The party just had a one-member team during the last election but now it has expanded.  The party high command recognises the need for a strong social media presence,” said a member from the IT wing.  An IT wing member said that they were chalking out a plan to counter the strong presence of the DMK on social media platforms. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We will challenge them on social media too.  We do have a plan,” the AIADMK member said.  Chennai today RELIGION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Illegal roads off ECR a cause for concern According to Coastal Resource Centre, the roads laid by the Chennai Corporation and local bodies for a distance of 5.8 kilometres between Thiruvanmiyur and Muttukadu along the East Coast Road (ECR) are a violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification 2011,. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coastal Resource Centre seeks to support coastal communities in challenging destructive developmental activities. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Centre has released a report ‘Road Rolling Laws’ documenting the 10 illegal side roads laid by the civic body and other local bodies. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“In almost all of these areas, these illegal roads are accompanied by the construction of illegal buildings, a fisherman from Urur Kuppam, a coastal hamlet in Besant Nagar. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“These development activities rob the fisher-folk of livelihood and living spaces, and affect the natural ecology of the coast.  Rise in the built-up area near the waterline increases the area’s vulnerability to natural disasters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr.  Saravanan pointed out that the CRZ states that no developmental activities should take place between the Low Tide Line and the High Tide Line.  Further, there should not be any activity, special and rare cases) in this regard.  But, no approval has been sought in this regard.  Akila Balu, coordinator, Student Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN), said, “The development activity not only affects the natural ecology of the coastline, but also the marine life.  The sea turtles need to come beyond the High Tide line to lay the eggs.  It is important that we protect their habitat.  The mortality rate of these turtles is high. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The turtles are sensitive to light.  Some years ago, following a request from conservationists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coastal Resource Centre has released a report ‘Road Rolling Laws’ documenting 10 illegal side roads that have been laid by the civic body and other local bodies More fire engines on standby for Deepavali With Deepavali just around the corner, the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services Department,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A senior official of the Fire and Rescue Services Department said around 34 spots in the city and suburbs have been identified as vulnerable during the Deepavali season. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, with a view to reinforce the manpower and ensure a quick response in case of an emergency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The official pointed out the stepped-up safety arrangements will be in place from November 8-12, when the shopping season will be at its peak. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The vulnerable spots where the fire vehicles will be deployed include MGR Nagar in Nesapakkam, Ayodhya Mandapam in Triplicane, near Vadapalani signal, Velachery bus stand and Tambaram Bazaar. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The deployment of vehicles and other safety measures are part of a wider strategy, where the Fire Department will coordinate with the police personnel to ensure a safe and sound Deepavali for residents of the city. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maanja crackdown continues For over a month now, kite flying and ‘maanja’ thread have been among the most frequently used terms in communications between policemen at the control room of the Chennai city police headquarters and police stations. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This comes after the city police said that loss of life due to the flying of kites with maanja thread could be treated as causing death due to negligence or even culpable homicide under the Indian Penal Code.  Recently, a five-year-old boy had died on Perambur flyover when a kite thread slit his throat.  “We have identified certain areas such as slums and government housing quarters where such kite flying is widely prevalent, GKM Colony in Peravallaur, Madurai Swami Madam in Perambur, Kannigapuram and Railway’s Manga Thoppu in Pulianthope, Washermenpet are famous for this practice. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Residents use the terraces of many of the housing board quarters in these areas to make maanja.  The lack of staircases in such buildings makes it easy to evade the police. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Chennai Corporation sources, residents of 248 neighbourhoods reported water stagnation.  There were four reported cases of tree falls. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Considering the heavy rains did not last long, it is surprising that complaints were flying thick and fast. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vijayanagar-Velachery, Maduvankarai in Guindy Race Course,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite the Corporation commissioning new structures to drain water on these roads, maintenance of chambers in new pipelines installed along them – Sterling Road being a classic example – remains a challenge for zonal level staff.  The Corporation was unable to commission new drains on such roads due to the presence of other civic utilities underneath. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Minister for Municipal Administration S. P.  Velumani and Mayor Saidai Duraisamy visited Santhome, Anna Nagar and Kodungaiyur to inspect measures taken to reduce water stagnation and improve public health.  Fewer cases of water stagnation were reported on 191 bus routes developed by Chennai Corporation for the Global Investors’ Meet.  Most of the water stagnation was reported from 52 km of highway roads and 33, Porur Junction on Arcot Road, OTA on GST Road, Vysarpadi subway, YMCA, EGA Theatre and Iswarya Mandapam in Koyambedu reported severe waterlogging.  Highways and Chennai Corporation used pumpsets to bale out water in such areas. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paper Mills Road and key stretches in Besant Nagar and Sastri Nagar reported reduced water stagnation owing to rainwater harvesting structures commissioned in the past few months. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stretches including Demellows Road in Choolai reported reduced water stagnation due to super sucker machines.  Such roads used to report severe water stagnation in the past.  The Corporation used 43 super sucker machines, 60 jet-rodding machines and 150 desilting machines. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Corporation plans to ask educational institutions on stretches such as Santhome High Road to commission rainwater harvesting structures to prevent waterlogging.  Waterlogging plagues arterial roads Enthusiastic shoppers ventured out of their homes on a bright sunny morning on Sunday, only to be trapped in massive traffic snarls owing to heavy rain later in the day. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Across Chennai, thousands were caught in traffic jams, people had a very tough time reaching both sides. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“It took us around an hour and a half to get from West Mambalam to Pondy Bazaar, and finally we went to Rangarajapuram and used the two-wheeler subway because Duraisamy Subway was blocked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since it was a Sunday, however, who decided to watch movies on her laptop.  “I normally go out on Sundays because it is my only day off, but with the rain, I decided it was better to stay at home,” she said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The heavy downpour in the city left roads and subways flooded, leaving motorists stranded in traffic.

Motorists bound for Velachery as water filled up the Thillai Ganga Nagar subway.  Motorists proceeding towards the southern arm of the Inner Ring Road from Nanganallur had to take a detour via Adambakkam or Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road after rain water stagnated in the subway for more than a feet. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sources in Aavin said that despite waist-deep water-logging in one of its dairies, milk was despatched at the usual time.

Dhauli Hills,"Light vehicles to take visitors atop Dhauli in Bhubaneswar  BHUBANESWAR: Tourists, visiting the famous peace pagoda at Dhauli Hills on the outskirts of the city, would soon have a pleasant time as the state government has decided to introduce light vehicles to carry them from foothills to hilltop.  The decision was taken in the wake of frequent accidents of tourist buses at the hills.  “The tourism department has decided to introduce eight 32-seater vehicles.  The government would sanction funds for the vehicles in the next annual budget,” culture and tourism minister Ashok Panda told TOI. 
Nearly 1,000 tourists, including foreigners, visit Dhauli every day, tourism department sources said. 
On February 7, 2012, four persons were killed and 30 injured as the tourist bus, carrying them, skidded off the road while descending.  Overshooting the concrete fence, bordering the hilly roads, the bus crashed down nearly 40 feet and got stuck in trees. 
In another incident on October 9 last year, a tourist from Nadia district in West Bengal was killed as the bus, he along with others was travelling in, fell into a gorge. 
To draw more visitors to Dhauli, the tourism department has also decided to introduce ropeway.  “We had a preliminary discussion on the issue at a meeting.  Ropeway has already been introduced at Nandankanan here and Taratarini Temple in Ganjam district.  We would invite the operators to finalize the proposal,” Panda said. 
The tourism minister said the government has also decided expedite the process to install light and sound show at Dhauli.  In October, the state government signed an MoU with Indian Tourism Development Corporation in this regard.  The project is hanging fire since 2010. 
Construction of a market complex to rehabilitate local traders, development of tourist police and earmarking places for picnickers were also discussed.

Archaeologists dig deep to uncover evidence of ancient civilization  BHUBANESWAR: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has started extensive excavation at Suabarai village in Pipili block about 15 km from here after indications emerged in June last year of the presence of a civilization that flourished nearly 3,500 years ago during the Chalcolithic Age. 
“We can’t say anything until we find some concrete evidence about the existence of an ancient civilization here,” said deputy director of ASI Jeevan Patnaik. 
The excavation began on a mound amidst paddy fields located on the banks of the Daya river and at the southern end of the historic Dhauli Hills.  This is the same place where the famous Kalinga War was fought in 261 BC.  Some 1,50,000 fought in the war and about 1,00,000 were slain, according to a rock edict from the period found on the hills. 
During excavation in June 2014, the ASI team had found some remnants of earthen pots, fragments of pots made of red soil, and ancient stones that pointed to the existence of a human civilization.  Also the excavators found deer horns, two animal teeth measuring two inches each and skeletal remains of birds and animals at the site. 
“ASI decided to start excavation on the site after villagers unearthed two four-feet tall ancient stone sculptures from the mound while digging a pit in April 2013,” an official source said. 
The excavation has been undertaken by a technical team consisting of archaeologists Sanjay Panda and Suvendu Kumar Khuntia.  The digging will continue till the onset of the rainy season, sources said. 
“It is possible that human skeletons may be found at the site.  So, digging work is being done very carefully,” said an officer. 
Anthropologists from Utkal University in Bhubaneswar had unearthed two human skeletons at Banga in Harirajpur area under Delanga block in Puri district, about 25 km from the city in 2013. The remnants were said to be around 3,500 to 4,000 years old and from the Chalcolithic Age. 
The excavation also has significance as it may throw light on the development and growth of the ancient civilization at Sishupalgarh on the outskirts of the city.  Sishupalgarh was an urban centre with a population of more than 20,000 that flourished between 500 BC and 600 AD.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Diphu Polytechnic,"Diphu Polytechnic running sans AICTE approval Correspondent DIPHU, July 5  The students of Diphu Polytechnic are in a bind as the institute has not received the approval of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). 
According to reports, the Diphu Polytechnic has been running without approval from the AICTE for past few years.  As a result, the students who are studying or have completed their courses are in a state of utter confusion over the fact that their engineering diplomas might be derecognised any moment. It may be noted that the reason that the Diphu Polytechnic has not received the required approval are the various allegations against the then principal Ram Chandra Das.  Sources said that due to his negligence of duty, the institution failed to obtain AICTE approval.  He, even concealed the status of the official progress works, students alleged. As per information received under the RTI Act, there are altogether 10 polytechnics in the State including the Diphu Polytechnic.  AICTE approval has been obtained for all polytechnics for the years 2015-16, 2014-15, and 2013-14 except that of Diphu Polytechnic. The Directorate of Technical Education, Guwahati, in its RTI reply stated that Ram Chandra Das, the principal of the Diphu Polytechnic was instructed to apply online for the consideration of AICTE approval for the year 2015-16, but he did not submit the online application.  It further mentioned that for the year 2013-14, Ram Chandra Das failed to attend the concerned meeting convened by the AICTE for consideration of approval.  It was further said that like the other nine polytechnics and four engineering colleges in the State, it was the responsibility of the principal, of the Diphu Polytechnic to submit the online application to the AICTE for approval. It needs to be mentioned here that the principal was specially reminded to submit the online application and resolve the matter with AICTE several times vide letter Nos TE(P) Scheme-4/86/1406 dated 31/03/2015, TEC.  148/2004/65 dated 22-04-2015, TE(P) Scheme-20/2013/3096 dated 10/07/2013 and TE(P) Scheme-4/86/1499 dated 11/04/2013 respectively. It is amazing that at the end, though the Deputy Secretary to the Government of Assam, Higher Education (Technical) Department directed the principal to submit the online application to AICTE for getting its approval for the year 2015-16 through letter No TE (P) Scheme-4/86/1406 dated 31 March, 2015, but no efforts were made by him. It is interesting to know that despite knowing well about his failure and negligence, he was then posted as the Controller of Examination at the State Council for Technical Education, by the concerned authority on April 27, 2015. Meanwhile, the local people have demanded of the Government to solve the long-pending problems of the institution immediately.

Sathyamurthy Bhavan," Congress appointments upset Tamil Nadu party men  CHENNAI: The Congress high command has appointed AICC treasurer Motilal Vora and Indiaâs last Governor General C Rajagopalachariâs great grandson C R Kesavan to the TNCC Trust, which is the custodian of three properties in the heart of Chennai valued at several crores of rupees.  They fill the vacancies caused by the resignations of former Union ministers G K Vasan and Jayanthi Natarajan from the party. 
The appointments have upset Congress cadres in Tamil Nadu as neither Vora nor Kesavan have contributed to the growth of the state Congress and they expected senior state workers to be picked as trustees, informed sources told TOI.  It is understood that partymen are particularly unhappy over the choice of Kesavan as he is the great grandson of Rajaji, who was chief minister of Madras presidency and had split the party in the 1960âs to form the Swatantra Party, which helped DMK to come to power in 1967 defeating Congress.  Vora, a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, is considered an outsider. 
In a statement, TNCC chief E V K S Elangovan said Congress president Sonia Gandhi has appointed Vora and Kesavan to the trust which is the custodian of the party headquarters (Sathyamurthy Bhavan) at Royapettah, the Congress grounds and the buildings at Teynampet including the Kamarajar Arangam, a popular venue for theatre and performing arts. 
The trust was reduced to three members -- Elangovan as executive member, former MLA D Yasodha and Rajya Sabha MP Sudarsana Natchiappan -- following the exit of Vasan, who formed a new party, and Jayanthi Natarajan. 
Following his return from the United States, Kesavan joined Congress in 2001 on the advice of veteran party member K Natwar Singh and was later appointed as director of the Rajiv Gandhi National Institute for Youth Development at Sriperumbudur.  âIt is an honour to be nominated member of this prestigious trust and I will strive to work for its improvement in cooperation with the existing members,â Kesavan told TOI.

Following his return from the United States, Kesavan joined Congress in 2001 on the advice of veteran party member K Natwar Singh and was later appointed as director of the Rajiv Gandhi National Institute for Youth Development at Sriperumbudur.  “It is an honour to be nominated member of this prestigious trust and I will strive to work for its improvement in cooperation with the existing members,” Kesavan told TOI.

HC: Protest not at the cost of public order  CHENNAI: The right to protest cannot include right to cause nuisance or harassment to public at large, the Madras high court has said. 
Disapproving of police permission for a caste outfit to hold demonstration in front of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) headquarters on December 12, 2014, the first bench said: “The concept of holding demonstrations propounding or rejecting a political and social philosophy would be questionable, especially when it is outside the residence of some people or in busy traffic areas.  ”
A P Suryaprakasam filed a PIL seeking action against police personnel who permitted the agitation outside TNCC’s Sathyamurthy Bhavan in Royapettah, and people who had participated in it.  The protest was staged against certain comments made by Karti Chidambaram on former TN chief minister K Kamaraj. 
In the petition, Suryaprakasam alleged that there were designated spots in Chennai for holding protests, it is illegal on the part of police to permit demonstration in front of the TNCC headquarters on December 12, 2014 .

Cong MLA files police complaint against state chief  CHENNAI: Unseemly factionalism racked the Tamil Nadu unit of the Congress once again, with the party’s Mahila Congress leader S Vijayadharani accusing TNCC chief EVKS Elangovan of using abusive language.  An Elangovan supporter in turn accused Vijayadharani of hurling at her abuses with a caste tone. 
Following complaints from both factions, Anna Salai police invoked IPC sections 506 (I) (criminal intimidation), 323 (assault), 284 (B) (abuse) and 354 (outraging the modesty of woman), section 4 of Tamil Nadu Women Harassment (Prevention) Act against Elangovan and three of his colleagues, including the newly appointed traders’ wing secretary M S Dhiraviyam.  A case has also been registered under sections 506 (I) (criminal intimidation) and Prevention of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against four persons, including Vijayadharani and Mahila Congress vice-president M Manasa. 
On Friday, Vijayadharani wrote a letter to AICC president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi, demanding action against the PCC chief.  On Saturday noon, state Mahila Congress vice-presidents R Santha Sreni and Manasa lodged a complaint with police, charging Elangovan and three functionaries with verbally abusing them, including Vijayadharani.  The two complainants said they were also roughed up by some of the partymen. 
There was more drama later in the evening, with Alis alias Manohari, another vice-president of TN Mahila Congress and Elangovan supporter lodging a complaint against Vijayadharani and Manasa, under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.  Manohari, accompanied by some senior party functionaries and some women wing members, all from the Elangovan camp, accused four partymen and women, including Vijayadharani and Manasa, of hurling abuse at her with caste overtones. 
Only recently, a group of senior leaders from the state, led by former Union minister P Chidambaram, had met Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to demand Elangovan’s ouster and his replacement with a new PCC chief capable of taking leaders and cadres along with him.  The move brought former PCC chief K V Thangkabalu in direct confrontation with Elangovan, with both leaders aiming barbs at each other in public forums.  On Thursday, TNCC vice president and businessman H Vasanthakumar raised the banner of revolt, questioning Elangovan’s authority in removing him from the post of traders’ wing secretary.  He had been among those who demanded Elangovan’s removal. 
In her letter to party high-command, Vijayadharani said the PCC chief had been harassing women, which was bound to erode the party's women support base in the state ahead of the May 2016 assembly election.  In August, Elangovan invited the wrath of AIADMK cadres for his distasteful remarks about PM Narendra Modi’s visit to CM J Jayalalithaa’s residence. 
Party sources said there was high drama at the headquarters, Sathyamurthy Bhavan on Friday after some cadres ripped off banners put up in the premises to mark former PM Indira Gandhi's birth anniversary.  Vijayadharani met Elangovan and demanded action against the offenders.  “Instead of taking action, Elangovan used filthy language and told me to quit the party,” Vijayadharani said, adding she staged a sit-in protest for two hours, despite Elangovan walking out of his chamber soon after.  The vice-presidents, who accompanied Vijayadharani alleged that some Elangovan supporters roughed them up. 
Vijayadharani, who was made state Mahila Congress president in August, said because of Elangovan's attitude, efforts taken to win over the confidence of women proved futile.  “Elangovan cannot ask me to quit the party, whose ideology I love most.  Things are becoming unpleasant with him in the state,” she said. 
When contacted, Elangovan denied the allegations.  “It is a democratic party and any one can air their views.  I only told Vijayadharani not to shout and make a big noise and to lower her voice.  There are eyewitnesses to the incident,” he told TOI.  Insiders say that Elangovan’s remarks made in the ‘heat of the moment’ had vitiated the party atmosphere further.  Actor Nagma, who is also in-charge of the state Mahila unit, said, “Things have to be sorted out between the two presidents.  Any action can be taken only by our party high-command. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Elangovan, Karti Chidambaram resume war of words After a brief lull, the war of words between Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) leader E. V. K. S.  Elangovan and AICC member Karti P.  Chidambaram resumed and this time it is over the latter’s tweet congratulating Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Chief Minister-elect Arvind Kejriwal. 
In his tweet, Mr.  Karti said: “Lessons from #AAPSweep, no one is invincible, state politics needs a credible leader n an agenda.  People want leadership at their doorstep. ”
Congratulating the AAP and Mr.  Kejriwal for the big win, he said, “Many lessons to learn for the Congress particularly for us in the#TNCC.  Need a face n an agenda.  Will we?”
Reacting strongly to the message, Mr.  Elangovan said If Mr.  Karti was looking for a leader like Mr.  Kejriwal why should he search elsewhere.  “He is free to join the AAP.  He has said many things against the Congress party and it is for the high command to look into this issue and initiate action,” he said. 
Talking to reporters at Sathyamurthy Bhavan, he said Mr.  Karti was asking for trouble and he was not ready to play into his hands.  “The high command will deal with him. ”
Asked about Mr.  Elangovan’s remarks, Mr.  Karti said he was not ready to join issue with the TNCC leader.  “I stand by my tweet,” he asserted. 
Show-cause notice
A fortnight ago, Mr.  Elangovan slapped a show-cause notice on Mr.  Karti after he took a new initiative called 'G67' involving party workers. 
Mr.  Karti had explained that the idea behind the initiative was to bring together the generation born after 1967, the year the Congress lost power in the State, to modernise the party’s outlook. 
Karti’s tweet praising Arvind Kejriwal
irks Elangovan Jnanapith winner Jayakanthan dead Firebrand writer Jayakanthan, considered a colossus in Tamil literature, died here on Wednesday night after a prolonged illness. 
He was 81 and is survived by wife, two daughters and a son.  He won both the Jnanpith and Sahitya Akademi Awards. 
Jayakanthan never hesitated to swim against the current
Tamil novelist, short-story writer and essayist Jayakanthan significantly enriched modern Tamil literature by portraying the lives of those on the fringes society.  And he shocked the same society with his nonconformist views, often questioning long-held views on women and chastity. 
Sri Lankan Tamil literary critic K.  Sivathamby used to say that one of the greatest contributions of Jayakanthan was the change he brought about in the “process of thinking” in the Tamil literary world. 
“He wrote about the subjects not explored by others.  He identified the agon, a literary device in Greek tragedy indicating conflict, in the lives of the subaltern and popularised it,” he said. 
Born in 1934 in Cuddalore, Jayakanthan ran away from home to Madras and became a member of the Communist party at a very young age. 
His first short story appeared in a little known magazine Sowbakiyavathi.  He went on to become a prolific writer, authoring over 35 novels and novellas, innumerable short stories and two autobiographies—Oru Ilakkiyavathiyin Arasiyal Anubavangal and Oru Arasiyalvathiyin Ilakkiya Anubavangal—besides writing articles and composing poems. 
His novels Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal, Oru Nadigai Nadagam Paarkiral, Yaarukkaga Azhudhaan and Cinemavukku Pona Chithalu were adapted as films.  Jayakanthan himself experimented with film-making and directed Yarukkaka Azhudhaan, Unnai Pol Oruvan and Paathai Theiryuthu Paar. 
His novels and short stories published in literary magazines and popular journals made him a household name in Tamil society.  And in a state where Brahmins are at a receiving end, Jayakanthan viewed the community sympathetically and his works bear testimony to his views. 
In the Communist party, he was close to K.  Baladhandayutham.  JK, as he was known, said in his autobiography that it was Baladhandayutham, just released after serving a life term, who drew him to politics with his thunderous speeches. 
He took enormous pride in his skills as a writer and fiery orator.  He spoke his mind candidly, undaunted by anyone or anything.  At a meeting organised at Sathyamurthy Bhavan to condole the death of Chief Minister C. N.  Annadurai, he made the leaders squirm by lambasting Anna and the DMK. 
But he mellowed down with the passage of time and DMK leader M.  Karunanidhi, despite Jayakanathan’s contempt for the Dravidian movement, respected him and finally won him over.  “I have always been against the Dravidian movement.  But the leaders have always been kind to me,” he said at a meeting later. 
He shared the passion of many CPI leaders for Nehruvian socialism and had great respect for Indira Gandhi.  He later joined the Tamil Desiya Katchi launched by E. V. K.  Sampath and both of them, along with poet Kannadasan, went over to the Congress subsequently. 
He also edited a pro-Congress daily Navasakthi for a while. 
Once his popularity as a writer declined, and as the Congress’s political fortunes too nosedived, he withdrew into a shell.  Yet, his courage of conviction was something very rare, and he never hesitated to swim against the current.  Long before Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, he denounced the LTTE as a fascist organisation at every opportunity, much to the chagrin of Tamil nationalists. 
He wrote very little in the last phase of his life, but used to be the centre of a regular adda at his room or in his residence in Chennai.  Firebrand writer who dared to question social mores Tamil novelist, short-story writer and essayist Jayakanthan significantly enriched modern Tamil literature by portraying the lives of those on the fringes of society.  And he shocked the same society with his nonconformist views, often questioning long-held views on women and chastity.

Born in 1934 in Cuddalore, Jayakanthan ran away from home to Madras and became a member of the Communist Party at a very young age. 
While writing about his life in Chennai he would say, “I counted among my close friends rickshaw pullers, prostitutes, rowdies, pocket-pickers and rag-pickers.  That is why I never hated them.  In fact, I have an affinity towards them.  His first short story appeared in a little known magazine Sowbakiyavathi.

He wrote very little in the last phase of his life.  AP govt. misused power: M.K. Stalin DMK treasurer M. K.  Stalin on Wednesday said though he was against felling of trees and smuggling of forest timbers, the Andhra Pradesh government had misused its power by killing 20 persons in the name of preventing red sanders smuggling.  In a statement here, he said the action of the Andhra Pradesh police not only violated human rights, but also inhuman.  He also wanted an inquiry into the incident by a sitting judge.  Pointing to reports that the killing of 20 persons in police firing was a pre-planned murder, he said the failure of the Tamil Nadu government to act despite the tense situation on the State’s border was highly condemnable. 
‘A pre-meditated encounter’
TNCC president E. V. K. S.  Elanogovan said the bullet injuries received by the victims had proved that they were shot from a close range.  “It seems it was a pre-meditated encounter,” he told reporters at Sathyamurthy Bhavan.  He also demanded a CBI inquiry into the suicide of senior engineer of the agriculture department Muthukumarasamy.  Jayakanthan’s views closer to Dravidian ideology, says Kanimozhi Forty-six years after writer Jayakanthan lambasted the Dravidian Movement and DMK founder C. N.  Annadurai at Sathyamurthy Bhavan, DMK MP Kanimozhi on Wednesday declared at the same venue that the late writer’s views were close to the Dravidian ideology. 
“He was never in favour of a nation in which Tamils or other nationalities would lose their identity and rights.  He also wondered whose interest the Indian Constitution was representing and argued that a Constitution denying self-determination to States was nothing but a slave manual,” she said at a condolence meeting for Jayakanthan organised at the Congress headquarters by the Desiya Murasu reader’s circle. 
Ms.  Kanimozhi said there was no difference between the State autonomy propagated by the DMK and Jayakanthan’s views on the subject.  She said even though Jayakanthan was highly critical of Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar, the grand old man appreciated every word Jayakanthan spoke at the Tamil writers’ conference. 
Writer S.  Ramakrishnan said though the Communist Movement taught and shaped Jayakanthan, Jawaharlal Nehru remained an inspiration for him.  “Nehruvian idealism found expression in his characters,” he said, rejecting the allegation that Jayakanthan’s works smacked of propaganda.  “He himself said one of the functions of literature is propaganda,” said Mr Ramakrishnan. 
CPI leader K.  Subbarayan said Jayakanthan was a continuation of the long tradition and greatness of Tamil land and its great men delved deep in wisdom.  CPI (M) MP T. K.  Rangarajan, Jayakanthan’s friend P. S.  Kuppusamy and senior Congress leader and editor of Desiya Murasu A.  Gopanna spoke.  Chennai today RELIGION

Congress men block road, seek action against AIADMK cadres Condemning the continuing incidents of burning of effigy of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president E. V. K. S.  Elangovan and Monday’s attack on TNCC headquarters ‘Sathyamurthy Bhavan’ in Chennai by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam cadres, Congress cadres blocked the road in front of their party office at Kokkirakulam here on Tuesday. 
Raising slogans against Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the Congress cadres, led by former Union Minister R.  Dhanushkodi Athithan, blocked the road, disrupting vehicular traffic on the busy thoroughfare for a while.  They also tried to rip off the poster of Ms.  Jayalalithaa, but the attempt was thwarted by police. 
When the police warned them of stern action, the Congress cadres wound up their agitation immediately and went inside their party office.  The protesting Congress functionaries said that if the police decided to register a case against the Congress cadres for the agitation, they should first register a case against those who had been burning the effigies of Mr.  Elangovan since Monday.  Maintain law and order: Vasan Tamil Maanila Congress president G. K.  Vasan hoped that the ruling party will realise its prime responsibility for upkeep of law and order in the context of protests by AIADMK partymen against Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president E. V. K. S.  Elangovan. 
Mr.  Vasan, who was here to take part in the conference of TMC’s agricultural wing, told reporters on Wednesday that agitations must not cause public inconvenience and that people were keenly watching utterances by leaders of political parties. 
Leaders can no longer assume that they can expand vote bank by exceeding their brief while criticising political rivals, Mr.  Vasan said, in an apparent reference to Mr.  Elangovan’s portrayal of the recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.  “Those in responsible positions must not insult duly elected representatives,” Mr.  Vasan said, but added the TMC did not endorse the protests by AIADMK in front of Sathyamurthy Bhavan, the Congress headquarters. 
Total prohibition
On total prohibition, Mr.  Vasan said it could be practically implemented in stages.  AIADMK stages protests against TNCC chief E V K S Elangovan CHENNAI: AIADMK workers today staged protests here and in several other parts of the State against Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief E V K S Elangovan for criticising the recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and their party supremo and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. 
After Modi called on Jayalalithaa here on August 7, Elangovan had slammed both AIADMK and BJP and in reference to the meeting he had used some words which were allegedly derogatory. 
Condemning him, ruling party workers staged protests and burnt his effigies in locations including T Nagar, Anna Salai and Manapakkam where Elangovan's residence was located. 
AIADMK workers, who tried to march towards Elangovan's residence and Congress headquarters Sathyamurthy Bhavan, were blocked by police. 
Tamil Nadu BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan said her party would stage protests across the state tomorrow against Elangovan for his "" uncivilised criticism. "" 
While ally of the ruling party, AISMK chief Sarathkumar condemned Elangovan for his remarks, opposition parties have expressed support for the TNCC chief. 
"" AIADMK regime can as usual file defamatory cases or could express their views democratically.  However, burning his effigies or violence is unacceptable,""  Karunanidhi said here in a statement condemning the protests by the ruling party. 
MDMK chief Vaiko too condemned the protests. 
Effigies of Elangovan were burnt in Salem and Coimbatore and other parts. 
AIADMK workers, led by MLAs, staged demonstrations at various places in Coimbatore. 
Elangovan had made the controversial remarks here on August 14 while participating in a protest organised by his party seeking liquor ban in Tamil Nadu. 
Meanwhile, Congress workers staged a protest inside the party headquarters here against AIADMK.  Congress men tried to burn an effigy of Jayalalithaa.  However, it was thwarted by police. 
Following the protests and counter protests, a strong posse of police has been deployed in Congress and AIADMK offices.

Wanowrie Bazaar,"Defence Minister:  PCB members urge defence authorities to reopen roads  PUNE: The elected members of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) on Wednesday demanded the defence authorities reopen the Elite Lines Road on Ghorpadi village and Right Flank Road in Wanowrie Bazaar for public use.  According to the members, the defence authorities closed the roads without following a legal procedure.  The members pointed out that defence minister Manohar Parrikar, during his visit to the city on January 7, had directed the defence authorities to reopen the roads, but the latter have not followed the directives yet.  During the general body meeting, the members threatened to launch an agitation if their demands are not considered.  PCB vice-president Kiran Mantri alleged that the defence authorities are closing city roads citing security reasons without issuing a public notice to invite suggestions and objections from them.  “Local residents who take the Elite Lines Road linking Kalyaninagar and Koregaon Park are now forced to use longer routes to reach the same destinations.  The road should be reopened as there is no security threat to the army units,” Mantri said.  Senior PCB member Vinod Mathurawala said the wall constructed on the Right Flank Road linking Wanowrie Bazaar to the surrounding areas should be demolished and the road should be reopened for the smooth flow of traffic as it is maintained by the PCB.  The road was closed without issuing public intimation.  Mathurawala pointed out that the PCB has erected street light poles on the stretch and it has been maintaining the roads for several years now.  Another PCB member Vivek Yadav said the defence authorities should discuss the issue with the PCB officials, elected members and public representatives like MPs and MLAs.  “The defence authorities did not consult the principal director of defence estates, Southern Command Headquarters before closing the roads.  This caused a lot of inconvenience to the public,” Yadav said.  Other members Dilip Giramkar and Atul Gaikwad said the army should improve its security arrangements and construct a wall outside its units instead of closing the roads to avoid direct confrontation with people.  The members appealed to the PCB president Brigadier A K Tyagi to issue an order to reopen the roads.  Tyagi told the members that he is not the final authority to take any decision on the issue.  But, he assured the members that he will convey their demands to his superiors.  The decision to close the roads was taken as per law, he added.

Cantonment roads closure: Members call on Parrikar  PUNE: Elected members of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) have once again sought the intervention of defence minister Manohar Parrikar to re-issue directions to the defence authorities in Pune to reopen the Elliot Lines Road in Ghorpadi and Right Flank Road in Wanowrie Bazaar. 
PCB vice president Kiran Tushar Mantri, in the presence of MP Anil Shirole, has handed over a memorandum demanding the immediate opening of both the roads, among other demands, to Parrikar at the New Circuit House on Saturday. 
The other demands include relaxing the stringent floor space index norms, revoking the decision of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Southern Command, Pune of curtailing over Rs 7.86 crore from the annual budget of the PCB for 2015-16, action against defence authorities not paying service charges of nearly Rs 276 crore to the PCB and the state government collecting local body tax from traders on behalf of the PCB. 
The government has abolished the LBT collected by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) with effect from August 1, 2015. 
PCB members Priyanka Shrigiri, Atul Gaikwad, Dilip Giramkar and Vivek Yadav representing the BJP were present on the occasion. 
Mantri, in her memorandum, said Parrikar, during his visit to Pune on January 7, had issued directions to local military authorities to re-open the closed roads, but they had opened only two of the four roads.  She appealed to Parrikar to re-issue directions to re-open the Elliot Line Road linking Kalyaninagar and Koregaon Park and Right Flank Lines Road linking Wanowrie Bazaar to the surrounding areas as it was causing severe inconvenience to local residents, forcing them to use longer routes to reach destinations. 
The road closure issue had rocked the general body meeting of PCB on March 18.  The members had appealed to PCB president Brigadier A K Tyagi to issue an order to reopen the roads.  Tyagi had told the members that he was not the decision-making authority, but had assured the members that he will convey their demands to his superiors.  The decision to close the roads was taken as per law, he had said. 
Mantri also demanded the relaxation of FSI norms, which is one in the civil area and 0.5 in the bungalow area, as residents were unable to obtain permissions for conducting repairs and reconstructing old and dilapidated buildings.  The FSI restrictions came into force in 1988.  The Southern Command had rejected the PCB’s proposal to increase the FSI because of environmental concerns.  Mantri also demanded that the proposal of the new building bye laws be approved in public interest. 
On budget curtailment, she said the PCB had made a provision of over Rs 19 crores in the annual body for 2015-16, but the principal director of defence estates had curtailed the budget of over Rs 5.36 crore, which was further reduced to over Rs 7.86 crore by the GOC-in-C when it was sent for his sanction.  There is no need to reduce the budget as maximum income is generated from local sources, she added. 
The vice president said defence authorities had not paid service charges of nearly Rs 276 crore to the PCB.  The authorities had released funds of Rs 1 crore for 2014-15.  Parrikar’s intervention was also sought to release the service charges as soon as possible as it was affecting developmental work in the cantonment area. 
The board was getting its octroi share of Rs 18 crore from the PMC after deducting water charges.  After octroi was abolished in 2013, the PMC had stopped paying this sum to the board.  The civic body had started the LBT on April 1, 2013 which will be abolished from August 1, 2015. 
Mantri urged the government to pay the pending octroi dues to the board as compensation as the board is not authorized to collect LBT from traders. 
Parrikar held discussions with J Sharma, principal director of defence estates, Southern Command and others.  He assured the members that he would look into their demands.  An email sent by TOI to the defence spokesperson was unanswered.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Wanowrie area celebrates a more meaningful Eid  PUNE: At a time when festival celebrations are getting louder, this gesture by residents of Wanowrie, Ram Tekdi and surrounding areas comes as a trendsetter. 
There was a time when a wall of close to 20 to 25 loud speakers would blare music and 150 to 200 flex boards and banners would be unfurled at various junctions in the area for Eid-ul-Fitr. 
However, Eid on Saturday, was different.  Not only did the residents stay away from the loudspeakers and flex banners routine, they also donated food items and new clothes to 100 poor Muslim families in Ramtekdi so that they could celebrate the festival. 
They collected close to Rs 90,000 after deciding to do away with the sound and visual pollution.  The initiative, an effort from the Wanowrie police station and Maharashtra Muslim Front, started with regular interactions with the residents of these areas in the month of Ramzan.  Senior inspector Bapu Kale, in-charge of Wanowrie police station, said, "" For a month we conducted meetings with youths, various mandals, senior citizens, NGOs and maulanas of the areas falling under our police station.  During these meetings, we appealed to the groups to celebrate Eid peacefully.  We requested them not to display banners and restrict loud speakers.  We convinced them that with the same money, some charity could be done. "" 
To their credit, citizens responded positively and it was evident on Saturday when not a single loud speaker or banner was seen in these areas.  There are 11 mosques in Ghorpadi, Wanowrie, Wanowrie Bazaar, Wanowrie gaon, Ramtekdi and Salunke Vihar Road.  All these places did not have loud music nor the banners.  Nadeem Shafi Mujawar of the Maharashtra Muslim Front said, "" Many families in Ramtekdi cannot afford daily meals.  Besides, the ingredients to cook the Eid feast are expensive.  We were happy that we could help these 100 families and at the same time celebrate the festival peacefully. "" 
Mujawar along with other members of the organization including Shahaji Sawant, Sharif Khan, Hasan Quereshi and others bought new clothes including sarees for ladies, dry fruits, milk and rice and this was distributed to poor families. 
Police took utmost precaution in Ramtekdi area due to the recent clashes between citizens, but the festival was celebrated peacefully.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Duo attack three with sickles in Wanowrie  PUNE: Two men, brandishing sickles, went on an attacking spree injuring four men over a petty dispute in Wanowrie village around 11pm on Saturday.  The condition of one of the injured is serious while three others sustained minor injuries.  Police arrested one of the assailants on Sunday while a hunt has been launched to trace his aide.  "" The assailants, Dadya alias Swapnil Waghmare (27) and Mazhar Shaikh (28), both from Wanowrie Bazaar, beat Abid alias Amit Ramesh Sasane (29) and attacked him on his head with a sickle.  Waghmare and Sasane had had a dispute some time back and the attack was in response to the quarrel,""  said senior inspector Bapu Kale, in-charge of the Wanowrie police station.  Kale said, "" The assailants also attacked Tejas Nivrutti Chopade (24) and Abhijeet Deepak Gaikwad (21), who live nearby, when they tried to intervene.  The assailants ran away after villagers rushed to the spot. ""  Sikander Khaivalya (38), who lives in the area, chased the attackers and tried to overpower one of them after some distance.  But they turned back and beat Khaivalya before escaping.  The villagers admitted Sasane in a private hospital.  A police team arrested Waghmare from his hideout on Sunday morning.  "" Waghmare has confessed to attacking Sasane and others.  Shaikh, who is still missing, has been booked for abetment.  Sasane and Waghmare did small-time jobs together,""  Kale said.  Police could not record Sasane's statement because he is not in a position to speak.  The Pune cantonment court has sent Waghmare in police custody remand till July 22 for recovering the weapon and for ascertaining the motive behind the attack.  Pervez Inamdar, managing director of Inamdar Hospital in Fatimanagar where Sasane is being treated, said, "" Sasane has suffered several injuries before.  He underwent a CT scan, but we did not find any major abnormalities.  His family members have sought his discharge from the hospital against medical advice. ""  The victim's cousin, Atul Ganesh Wanawadikar (29), has lodged a complaint against the assailants which has been registered under section 307 (attempt to commit murder) of the Indian Penal Code.  Police have beefed up bandobast in the area although no untoward incident was reported from Wanowrie village after the attack.  Kale said, "" No law and order problem has been reported in the area.

Mattuthavani,"Seven shops sealed for not paying rent  MADURAI: Cracking the whip on erring shopkeepers in Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminal, city corporation commissioner, who conducted an inspection, ordered the closure of about seven shops, which had been eluding from paying the rent for the last three months.  Officials said the major crackdown on Wednesday against the shopkeepers was conducted after receiving a large number of complaints.  The shopkeepers were encroaching public space creating hardship for the passengers.  There are roughly 180 shops constructed by the corporation.  Many violations were identified during the inspection.  About seven shops have been closed down and the rest of the shops have been severely warned.  Many shops do not even have the shutters to close and seal.  Commissioner C Kathiravan ordered his officials to fine each shop without shutters with Rs 30, 000 and force them to install it immediately.  Cleanliness was not properly maintained and shops were found modified without the consent of the civic authorities.  Even as the shops were not permitted to use stoves to prepare food many were found doing it.  Items kept outside, encroaching the public space including eatables were seized.  He ordered the officials to raze down the modifications made by the shopkeepers. 
Kathiravan said, “Almost all the shops here violated the rules ultimately creating hardship for the passengers.  More than 20% of the shops here have not paid the rent for the past three months.  It is clearly evident that the monitoring officials have failed to look into the issues.  Although action has not been initiated this time, they will be taken to task if they continue with the same attitude,” he said. 
Expecting that the officials and shopkeepers would not follow his instructions, the commissioner came back in a few minutes by leaving his vehicle outside and true to his expectations he found the officials having left the place without carrying out the works assigned to them and the shopkeepers continuing with their business leaving his instructions to the wind.  He then instructed the officials to seal the erring shops, make the changes he had instructed about and asked them to send the photos of completed tasks. 
Having seized a large amount of edible items like biscuits, fruits and sweets in the sudden eviction drive the civic body donated them to old age and children’s homes in the city.  The officials seized materials like school bags which were sold encroaching the public area.  The school bags were asked to be donated to corporation school students who needed one.  Office space likely Corporation authorities who inspected the Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminal after receiving complaints from the public are planning to construct spaces which can be occupied for office use on rental.  C Kathiravan, corporation commissioner, along with officials including A Devadoss, assistant commissioner inspected the buildings which house the shops had a short discussion with engineering section officials too.  The commissioner mooted the plan of constructing a first floor which can be rented to private parties as office building.  There is space to the tune of thousands of square feet.  Buildings with the participation of private sector can be constructed there without much investment from corporation side and can be given on rent.  While the corporation is need of fund, the rental amount from the space could add the revenue.  The commissioner instructed the officials to plan something for office buildings instead of small shops as they would further create problems in the bus terminal, he said.

Bus operators claim toll fee on ring road is unauthorised  MADURAI: Aggrieved over the order by a single judge of the Madras high court Madurai bench in collection of user fee on Madurai's Inner Ring Road, an appeal has been filed at the high court bench.  Virudhunagar District Bus Owners Association (VDBOA) represented by its secretary has preferred the appeal against the single judge's order passed on October 31, 2014 partly allowing the VDBOA's earlier petition.  The members of VDBOA are the stage carriage operators operating either within Virudhunagar district or on inter-district routes between Madurai and Virudhunagar.  To ease traffic congestion, the government had established an integrated bus stand at Mattuthavani and an Inner Ring Road on the northern side of Madurai.  It was opened for public and vehicular operation from November 1, 2000, by virtue of government order of the municipal administration and water supply (MC. II) department, dated October 23, 2000 and toll fee was fixed for using the said road.  By the same order, the municipal administration and water supply department had notified permitting the Madurai Corporation to collect toll fee for the first five years with an annual rate of 8 per cent.  However, the toll collection continued even after the cut-off period without further notification.  Challenging it the VDBOW filed a case seeking to direct the corporation to refund the amount collected from its members from December 1, 2005 till date and further forbear it from collecting any toll fee for using Inner Ring Road in Madurai city.  The corporation told that it is entitled to collect toll fee for 15 years and as per the government order passed in January 2014, it has been granted permission for collection of toll fee up to October 31, 2014 with increase of 8 per cent.  After hearing it, the judge quashed the January 2014 order but rejected the petitioner's refund claim.  Aggrieved over it, it has now filed an appeal stating that the order is suffering from improprieties, perversities and illegalities, and hence it needs interference of the court.  The appellant obtained information under the RTI Act about the collection of user fee on the ring road from November 1, 2000 to April 30, 2014.  As per the information, the collection came to around Rs 120 crore.  Actually, the corporation had to pay only Rs 64 crore inclusive of interest towards the borrowed amount from TNUDF.  When it achieved the target, it still collects fee at the rate of 8% every year, the appellant said.  When the matter came up for hearing, the division bench comprising justices S Tamilvanan and V S Ravi ordered notice to be issued to the municipal administration and water supply secretary and Madurai corporation commissioner.

Worn-out city buses offer a rough ride  MADURAI: A journey in city buses here is no joy ride, as jerky vehicles and worn-out seats are putting passengers to physical hardship.  Just 10 minutes' observation of buses at the Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminal is enough to give a clear picture of the state of buses operating under the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) here.  Many buses are found without window shields.  The sheets covering the body of the buses are flaky.  Passengers also complain that shock absorbers in buses have little effect, leaving them with back pains.  The seats are also in a miserable condition.  Commuters are now increasingly dumping TNSTC buses, which are usually the preferred mode of transportation, for share autos.  P Santhalakshmi has not enjoyed a ride in a city bus for at least five years now.  "" We last felt pleasure of travelling in a city bus when new buses (under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewable Mission) were introduced some five years ago.  The buses nowadays have a worn-out look and travelling in one is no longer a pleasure,""  she said.  "" In several buses, the window shields are stuck, broken or not found.  They cannot be used when needed.  During rains and heavy wind, we cannot sit beside the windows as there is no protection and we are directly exposed to it,""  said V Manikandan from Melur.  According to officials, there are 2,596 buses under TNSTC Madurai region, which also includes Virudhunagar, Dindigul and Theni districts.  There are 1,180 buses in Madurai alone.  Of these, 300 buses were received under JnNURM.  Besides places in the city, buses connecting other towns like Tirumangalam, Tiruparankundram, Usilampatti and Melur are also operated from here.  R Vasudevan, general secretary, CITU (TNSTC), Madurai, said the condition of buses used to be much worse.  At least now officials had intervened to sort out the shock absorber problem, he said.  When contacted, a senior official from TNSTC, Madurai region, said they are now looking into the issue.  "" I have been concentrating on problems connected with shock absorbers in the buses provided under JnNURM.  The work is over and we have set right the problem in around 225 buses out of the total 300.  Now, it's time for us to concentrate on the body of the bus.  The issue will be sorted soon,""  he said.

No major announcements, focus on revenue generation  MADURAI: For the second time in a row, the city corporation has presented a deficit budget, with the civic budget announced for the financial year 2015-16 estimating a deficit of close to Rs 6.24 crore.  V V Rajan Chellappa, mayor, on Tuesday presented the budget in the presence of corporation commissioner, C Kathiravan.  The budget estimates revenue of Rs 601.99 crore for the year against an expenditure of Rs 608.23 crore.  Confirming earlier TOI reports, no major schemes were announced.  The councillors fund, which was introduced last year, has been increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 15 lakh this year.  The fund will be used by the corporation upon special request from the concerned councillor for a particular work.  While councillors welcomed the increased the amount, some complained that the corporation still had not used the amount provided for last year.  M Chellam, councillor of ward 63, said the corporation had not used the fund allocated to her ward.  The mayor replied that when councillors requested for a particular development work in their ward, they should particularly mention that the councillor's fund is to be used.  A new Omni bus terminal near Mattuthavani has been proposed, expected to be carried out at an estimated cost of Rs 15.78 crore.  In addition, Rs 11 crore has been allocated for the construction of two lorry parking yards at Mattuthavani and Kochadai areas.  An additional 17 urban health centres and four community health centres under National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) have been announced.  Authorities said that instead of announcing big projects, they were concentrating on generating revenue.  The cash-strapped corporation is in no mood to declare projects they might not be able to fulfill.  Due to lack of funds, many projects announced last year, like construction of skating ground and another swimming pool, free transportation for corporation school students and establishment of 100 Amma children's parks, have not been executed.

Expert who helped Sagayam in granite inquiry dies in accident  MADURAI: A 54-year-old man who helped U Sagayam in his investigation into the multi-crore illegal granite quarrying scam was killed in a road accident near his house in the outskirts of the city on Friday morning. 
S Parthasarathy, an aero-modelling expert, recently helped the committee during its surveying activities by videographing the areas affected by the rampant quarrying, using a drone fitted with camera.  While police registered a case under IPC 304-A (causing death by negligence), family members did not rule out the possibility of foul play. 
A businessman by profession, Parthasarathy had a separate aeromodelling laboratory at home and often engaged in classes with the students of top schools and engineering colleges to explain aeromodelling.  He held several demonstrations in the district and other parts of the state.  He owned several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) out of passion and also spent time with researchers in this field. 
Police said Parthasarathy met with the accident when he was driving home on his hatchback early in the morning.  He left the house to drop a student, who had visited for academic purposes, at Mattuthavani bus terminal.  He rammed his car against a road side tree.  The bonnet of the vehicle was heavily damaged and he suffered serious injuries.  Passersby informed the police, and both the police and family members reached the accident spot at Veerapanchan in Madurai-Sivagangai Road.

Not even 5% of drivers adhere to system  MADURAI: Last Thursday marked the end of six months since the fixed auto rickshaw fare was introduced in Chennai.  Unfortunately, not even a 5% of auto rickshaw drivers have adhered to the fixed fare system in the city till now. 
Despite various efforts taken by the officials to ensure autos in the city ply by meter, they were able to achieve a feat of making 90% of regular autos and 80% of diesel autos to install meters alone.  RTOs failed to convince the auto drivers to use the meters.  Apparently, one can see many autos have not even removed cover of the meters since they have been fixed some three to four months ago. 
On October 16, the mandatory fixed auto rickshaw fare came into effect in the city.  Considering the difficulties faced by the auto drivers in installing the meters immediately, the district administration gave a grace period of 45-days to fix it.  Following it, severe checking was conducted to ensure all the autos were fixed with meters. 
However, the efforts following it to ensure that the drivers used meters only failed. 
Although RTOs conducted checks and even seized around 30 autos every month, it could not create any impact.  RTOs too showed slackness in conducting the checks on regular basis citing shortage of manpower. 
“I travel by autos often.  Not even a single time I have come across an auto rickshaw driver using the meter.  Even if you ask them, they say that it is not feasible for them as they have to return empty.  I can pay only for my drop not for the return,” said K Mythili from New Bangajam Colony. 
While a section of auto rickshaw drivers say that the fare set by the government would not help to earn a decent income, another section of drivers say that they want the officials to break the shackles of stand system and area problem. 
“If I go to Mattuthavani from Periyar bus terminal I have return empty as the auto drivers there would not let me to take passengers.  Since auto stands have flourished at every part of the city and they possess a command over certain areas, often we end up in picking up quarrel with them when we get passengers,” said S Muthumari, a driver from Periyar. 
“To end the problem, the government should increase the minimum fare at Rs 30 and Rs 15 for each additional kilometre instead of Rs 25 and Rs 12 at present,” urged N Kanagavel, district president of Madurai Auto Rickshaw Drivers Association of CITU.

Madurai residents hope rain would help water flow into parched tank  MADURAI: Residents in Anna Nagar and KK Nagar are anxiously looking at the Vandiyur tank with a hope that the incessant summer rain would bring an inflow into the parched tank, which is their main water source in the northern part of the city. 
"" It is this tank, which led to many residents choose KK Nagar, Melamadai and Gomathypuram, because it was always known to hold water throughout the year.  But, now this tank has remained bone dry for three consecutive years,""  said A Asokan, a resident. 
About 10 years ago, water flowed into the tank whenever there were heavy rains across the district.  But, now encroachments of major channels that bring water has led to the inflow stopping.  P Pandi, president of the Gomathypuram Residents Welfare Association and secretary of the Federation of Vandiyur Tank Water Development (FVTWD), said they are keeping their fingers crossed hoping that water would reach the tank, when water is released for irrigation in June this year from the Periyar dam. 
"" We just have to hope that the water level in Sathaiyaru dam the main source for Vandiyur tank touches the magic number of 29 feet,""  he said.  However, the water level in the Sathaiyaru dam is only 13 feet, without an inflow or discharge on Saturday.  He said that they had obtained all information with regard to the tank through RTIs and all paper work was in place to ensure that the water reached the tank during irrigation this year.  "" Usually, we receive water when water flows through the Kallanthiri channel.  However, this year, the channel from Moondrumavadi in K Pudur has been cleared and kept ready to bring water through the channel that crosses the flower market near Mattuthavani and the water coming through this channel would be much more and we could almost fill it up, with it,""  he said. 
Madurai North MLA, AK Bose, said that he had raised the issue of deepening the Vandiyur tank and also submitted letters to this effect to the PWD minister and chief minister.  "" When everything was going well, Amma (Jayalalithaa) went through a difficult phase and everything was stalled.  Now, we can hope that everything will be set right,""  he said. 
The MLA said that he had also asked the authorities to clear the encroachments on the channel in Ilandhaikulam.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  TNSTC bus driver attempts to set self, branch manager on fire  MADURAI: A 38-year-old driver attached with the Tamil Nadu state transport corporation (TNSTC), K Pudur depot attempted to commit suicide on Sunday night alleging that his branch manager had forced him to work overtime against his wishes.  Senthil Kumar, who poured petrol on himself, also poured petrol on the branch manager Dhayalakrishnan. 
The incident took place at Mattuthavani bus terminal at midnight.  Both men were hospitalised after petrol got into their eyes. 
Senthil Kumar, son of Solaimalai from Narasingam Road in Kadachanendaal was reportedly supposed to have ended his shift by 9.30pm as his duty time started at 1pm.  Senthil and conductor Saravanan were operating the bus on the C3 route, which connects Mattuthavani, Theppakulam and Mattuthavani. 
When Senthil Kumar reached Mattuthavani at 9.30pm on Sunday, he was asked to go for a trip to Trichy as there was huge crowd to clear.  Senthil Kumar refused, citing health problems.  However, he was asked to make a trip to Arapalayam.  Though he wanted to take rest, he obliged and went on the trip.  However, when he came back, he was asked to go to Arapalayam again.  An argument broke out between him and the branch manager.  An angry Senthil Kumar reportedly bought petrol from a nearby bunk, poured some on himself and some on Dhayalakrishnan and attempted to set both on fire.  Police said Senthil Kumar could also be charged with attempted murder if they received a complaint from the branch manager.  The transport department and police carried out an investigation. 
R Vasudevan, secretary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, TNSTC said when contacted that in the last three months, there has been pressure on the employees to work extra time.  If the employees are paid well, they will be happy to work but they are given nothing.  Senthil Kumar is just a reserve driver.  Even though he had completed 606 duties so far, he had not been promoted to the rank of daily wage driver.  A person has to become a daily wage employee before he/she becomes a permanent employee.  There are 200 such workers in Madurai branch who should have been promoted long back.  But they are still waiting for their dues.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Madurai corporation to begin removing dust from roads in a week  MADURAI: Sporadic showers and the battered condition of roads have caused dust to accumulate on city roads, with corporation unable to clear many of the stretches.  During a recent meeting with corporation officials, mayor V V Rajan Chellappa pointed out that most of the roads were covered with fine dust. 
Until the city corporation procured a suction truck for cleaning roads a few months ago, 25 workers per zone used to carry out the cleaning work.  However, after the machine was procured, the civic body moved these workers to other areas of work and relied heavily on the machinery.  However, the truck could not match the workload, which was evident in the mayor’s instructions. 
“The truck is cleaning the roads as per schedule but sand accumulation remains a problem.  The truck is not able to clean the central medians where sand gets accumulated.  We will bring in more manual workers to clean the roads again”, he said. 
Many arterial roads like the Bypass Road, Theni Road, New Jail Road and Anna Nager – Mattuthavani Road are covered with fine sand.  “During the peak hours, the entire road is covered with dust due to the sand and motorists have to ride through dust clouds.  The worst part is that two-wheeler vehicles skid and fall when the vehicles come in contact with these sand heaps,” said S Krishnakumar, a resident of SS Colony. 
K Janarthanan from KK Nagar said all roads in Anna Nagar were damaged and full of dust.  “Many of the roads are dug for various works and not repaired.  They leave the roads in a battered condition and sand too gets accumulation on the roads.  We not only develop back pains, but also have to inhale lot of dust particles which damages our health,” he complained. 
City engineer A Mathuram assured that the cleaning work will start in a week.  “We are using the suction truck as per the schedule but many of the roads are under the jurisdiction of the highways department.  But we will take up cleaning work in one week’s time,” he said.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Shops in Mattuthavani bus stand charge at will, raids ineffective  MADURAI: A 600ml Limca bottle is sold for Rs40 at the Mattuthavani bus stand, even though the maximum retail price (MRP) for the product is just Rs 34.  This is not the only branded product that is sold at the bus stand at more than the MRP.  It was found that food items like chips and cookies were sold for more than the fixed price, with shopkeepers fleecing the hapless passengers. 
Shops fix the prices according to their will.  Despite repeated raid at shops in the Mattuthavanai bus stand, the shopkeepers keep over-charging the consumers.  Santha Lakshmi, a passenger, said the shopkeepers sold a packet of chips worth Rs 10 for Rs 15 claiming that they had to pay rental charges for transporting the goods to the bus stand. 
“When I questioned him about the charges, the shopkeeper told me that they needed to pay money to load men who transport the goods from the market to the bus stand,”added Lakshmi. 
“If the companies bear the transportation charges, we will not overcharge the items,” said a shopkeeper at Mattuthavani bus stand. 
The labour department’ attempts to take action against such shops mostly go futile, as the shop owners are usually not present in the shops.  This makes it difficult to prosecute the shopkeepers who flout the MRP rules.  When contacted, labour department officials said a letter in this regard had been written to C Kathiravan, corporation commissioner. 
J Kalidas, inspector of labour, said, “We don’t even have the list of shop owners at Mattuthavani, making our work difficult.  Whenever we conduct raids, the shops owners are usually not present, making it difficult for us to take action.  However, we will soon be carrying out more raids. ” Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Alcoholics Anonymous: Meeting, Grace Kennett Hospital, rescued All work and no play made this 12-year-old boy from Nilakottai Taluk in Dindigul district run away from home on Wednesday.  However, fortunately, he was rescued by the staff of Childline after somebody alerted them over 1098 suspecting the behaviour of the child roaming around alone at the Mattuthavani Integrated Bus stand here. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“The boy claims that he was not allowed to play at all but was forced to study all the time,” Mr.  Jesudoss said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was even given severe punishment like making him kneel down on crystal salt, he added.  The Child Welfare Committee, Mr.  Jesudoss further said.  HC judges face security threat For the past 10 years, the sprawling 103-acre campus of the Madras High Court Bench here used to be a secluded fortress surrounded by vacant land on all four sides.  But it is not so any more.  Private buildings have begun to crop up right behind the judges’ bungalows and close to the court compound wall, thereby posing a security threat. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to court sources, there are 12 judges’ bungalows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bungalows could be accessed directly from the four-lane Madurai-Chennai national highway.  Apart from the 12 bungalows, two residential quarters meant for the Registrars were converted as judges’ bungalows. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Owing to paucity of accommodation facilities, the Registrar (Administration) of the High Court is occupying a quarters earmarked for a resident doctor, are under construction on the campus. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All along, the judges had only been facing snake and mosquito menace in their bungalows since the campus remained secluded and was full of trees. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“But now a security threat has cropped up ever since people started constructing buildings close to the court campus — the basement of one such house has been raised along the court compound wall,” a court official said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He pointed out that the house under construction was exactly behind a bungalow occupied by Justice C. S.  Karnan. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Similarly, another house had been constructed behind a bungalow occupied by Justice A.  Selvam without the mandatory distance required to be left vacant between two buildings.  “We don’t know how the authorities let these people flout building norms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyone could easily jump into the judges’ bungalows from these houses, another court official said and added that the only way to ensure security was to raise the height of the compound wall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“It is now up to the High Court’s security committee, comprising senior judges, the sprawling 103-acre campus of the Madras High Court Bench here used to be a secluded fortress surrounded by vacant land on all four sides.  But it is not so any more.  Private buildings have begun to crop up right behind the judges’ bungalows and close to the court compound wall, thereby posing a security threat.  According to court sources, there are 12 judges’ bungalows, including the one reserved for the Chief Justice, behind the main court building on the campus.  The bungalows could be accessed directly from the four-lane Madurai-Chennai national highway. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apart from the 12 bungalows, two residential quarters meant for the Registrars were converted as judges’ bungalows.  Owing to paucity of accommodation facilities, sanctioned recently, are under construction on the campus.  All along, the judges had only been facing snake and mosquito menace in their bungalows since the campus remained secluded and was full of trees.  “But now a security threat has cropped up ever since people started constructing buildings close to the court campus — the basement of one such house has been raised along the court compound wall,” a court official said.

Similarly, another house had been constructed behind a bungalow occupied by Justice A.

Anyone could easily jump into the judges’ bungalows from these houses, another court official said and added that the only way to ensure security was to raise the height of the compound wall, besides laying a road behind the judges’ bungalows and posting policemen round-the-clock.  Corporation acts tough on rent defaulters “If you pay the rent, it is well and fine.  If you don’t, then there will be fine. ” The Madurai Corporation will no more have the dent in its rental revenue since it has geared up to implement this without lenience. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shopkeepers can no longer default or delay in paying monthly rent as Commissioner C.  Kathiravan has cracked the whip directing them to pay the rent by 5{+t}{+h}of every month.  Corporation sources say that only 25 per cent of them are paying before this date and the rest pay as and when they like. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Through an order issued on February 3, he has brought as many as 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These shops are operating from various shopping complexes constructed by the Corporation at important places across the four zones, including Mattuthavani bus stand, Scott Road, RMS Road, Tamukkam complex and central vegetable market. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also, the market on East Marret Street,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the corporation authorities have noticed that payment of rent by shopkeepers is not prompt and there is a ‘take-it-easy’ approach among them.  Some of them delay for months together despite reminders. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All these practices will come to an end from this month since they have been warned that 10 per cent of rent amount will be collected as fine from those who pay after 5{+t}{+h}of every month or the shop allotment will be cancelled if they continue to delay. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We need revenue to provide civic amenities and the corporation gets rent from its various properties,” Mr.  Kathiravan said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He developed a friendship with the victim, a cashier at a shop in Mattuthavani bus stand.  She complained that the youth had sexually exploited her on the promise of marrying her.  However, a project of the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT), to become functional in the next few months. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“All the available space in the 50,000 square feet building has been booked.  While three companies have already resumed operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Built over 28 acres, the IT Park, including the global economic downturn. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apart from the built up space, the premises also has land where companies can construct their own buildings and operate.  The recent occupation of 4.5 acres of land by the renowned Bengaluru- based Honeywell is seen as a positive sign of development for the IT Park. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At present, the second floor of the built up space is empty and ready for occupation while 6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Most companies, who are yet to occupy the park,” said Kathir Kamanathan, Chief Executive Officer of Chella Software.  The Madurai-based company too has been allotted land at the IT Park. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manikandan.  A, Project Manager, said that the facilities at the park were satisfactory. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“With adequate car and two-wheeler parking as well as connectivity from the Mattuthavani bus stand through private buses and share autos, we have been functioning smoothly here.  There is immense potential to put the space available to use and we are hoping that the other companies will occupy the park soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the system did not take off for no fixed fare was then available for autos in the city. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only benefit was that the vacant space, read channel, ensured that the passenger vehicles did not obstruct free flow of traffic on the busy Madurai-Melur highway. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But, even after four long months have passed ever since the Tamil Nadu State Transport Department introduced fixed fare for autorickshaws,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a result, the Rs.  1.2 crore spent on creating the auto and taxi bays has been rendered useless. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides, there is chaos on the highway as autorickshaws are haphazardly parked all along the Melur Road,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the omni-bus stand was opened in the neighbourhood, a chunk of autos are haphazardly parked in the vacant space in front of the two-wheeler parking lot. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many autorickshaws still do not have meters.  And most of the drivers are not willing to use the meters, even if they have installed one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Traffic police personnel claim that they have little say in operating the pre-paid system or parking of vehicles without the cooperation of Corporation and RTOs. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The drivers, who park the vehicles outside the bays,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides cheaper fares, the pre-paid system would have also helped the passengers with a moral support as the vehicle number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These details would come in handy in case of any dispute over fare or missing valuables of passengers during their travel. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will the authorities make good use of the huge investment made on the system and save the passengers, who are otherwise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S.  Sundar Impounded buses lying idle in depots 103 buses, belonging to Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Madurai Division),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The book value of the movable properties (buses) impounded is a staggering Rs.  6.42 crore.  Disclosing this information to an applicant, R. T.  Ramesh Babu of Anaiyur,839 cases pending before the High Court and district courts regarding motor accident claims. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The applicant further said that though the Transport Department had replied to a query that it was taking action to retrieve the impounded vehicles as and when the earnings of the corporation improved, there was no specific response about steps being taken.  “The replies appeared wishy-washy.  It gives an impression that the officials are not serious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At a time when there were reports that many spare parts required for the buses were being ‘secretly’ removed from impounded buses, the condition of the “stranded” vehicles could be guessed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A TNSTC official said that out of the 103 impounded buses, at least 50 per cent were detained in the depot for over a year.  “Till some years ago,” he clarified. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To another query on frequency of maintenance of buses, the authorities have responded that all vehicles in operation were subjected to regular checks.  All the 668 buses were functioning. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The TNSTC earned the highest income from buses operated between Arapalayam and Tirumangalam (48 AD); Arapalayam and Mattuthavani (77 B) and Arapalayam and Mattuthavani, via Anna bus stand (77 BA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An official in the commercial section suggested that courts could direct the TNSTC authorities to ply these buses instead of impounding them and remit the collection in separate bank accounts, which would benefit both the claimants and the corporation.  In Karnataka, which was released to victims of road accidents.  Vendors complain of lack of facilities at flower market While the Mattuthavani flower market attracts a number of flower sellers and residents from across the city and surrounding areas daily, vendors complain that facilities are inadequate. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“There are 104 shops in the market and, in addition, president of Mattuthavani Flower Market Vendors’ Association. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S.  Muniyandi, a flower vendor, have no restrooms.  There is no drinking water facility,” he said.

“The pathways are full of potholes and garbage is not cleared till the evening.  There are not less than 30 tourists visiting the market daily, in addition to thousands of customers, a jasmine vendor.  Prices dip owing to heavy arrivals While prices of jasmine shot up to Rs.  2,800 a kg in late November, the flower was sold at Rs 150 a kg on Tuesday at the Mattuthavani Flower Market in the city.  Vendors said that the prices had further dipped a couple of days back to Rs.  80 to Rs.  100 per kg which was the lowest price in the last four months. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Heavy arrivals from Ilyarpatti and parts of Dindigul have resulted in the prices crashing over the last 10 days or so.  There have been close to five tonnes of jasmine brought to the market in the last few days,” said P.  Vijayan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stating that he expected the flower to not fetch more than Rs.  180 a kg in the next few days, he said that the prices would only increase after a week when the wedding season began and demand became high. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L.  Poomari, a flower seller near the Mattuthavani market ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Many women have heard that the prices have dipped and are coming to buy,” she said.  Most other flowers selling at extremely low rates has affected a few farmers who bring the flowers they cultivate for sale there. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After several rounds of talks with transport authorities who have decided to cancel permits if public are put to hardship by collecting excess amount, around 30 auto drivers have come forward to follow the meter system and revised fare fixed by the government.  On Friday evening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Regional Transport Officers – K.  Kalyanakumar (Madurai North), J.  K.  Baskaran (Madurai Central) and M.  Singaravelu (Madurai South) – who flagged off the meter-complying autos at Mattuthavani bus stand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The minimum fare is Rs.25 for a distance of 1.8 km and then it will be Rs.12 for every additional km. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50 per cent more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At night time, from 11 p. m.  to 5 a. m. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Since October we have been trying to implement the meter system and sufficient time was given to drivers to replace the old meters.  Fine was imposed on 300 autos which did not follow the rule.  Now, drivers have realised that their permits will be suspended if they do not comply and hence they approached us saying they will go by the revised fare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to Mr.  Singaravelu, there are 8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The victim, who had arrived here from Singapore in January, had planned the wedding of Karuppasamy.  However, the murder of the man had sent shock waves in family and friends’ circles. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officers, who are monitoring the case, in which the deceased was lying in a pool of blood, was stolen is a different story. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Murder-for-gain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Investigation into the murder so far suggested that the victim had two mobile phones. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since Karuppasamy was wearing some jewels, the police have not ruled out the murder-for-gain theory. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“We are in the process of collecting call details of one mobile phone, while the other phone,” a team member investigating the crime noted. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A police officer, however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a strong suspicion that the vehicle had gone into a petrol pump before proceeding to the backside of the HC Bench. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though the police had examined the vehicle owner for whom the K.  Pudur police had issued a CSR (Community Service Register) for his van-missing complaint, how and when the robbers got Karuppasamy into it and eliminated him was yet to be ascertained. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highway patrol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though every district had been provided with two highway patrol vehicles and the city Commissionerate with an equal number to be mobile, the police personnel on duty that night on the four-lane highway had no clue about the van’s presence for almost 20 hours. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only after a watchman of a realtor informed the police control room about the presence of a stationary van, the matter came to light. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The officers are optimistic of solving the crime and to quote an officer, “it is just a matter of time.  We will detect this case. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the fact remains that investigation into at least three murders reported in the city in the past is lying in cold storage.

On account of pipeline laying work for the underground drainage system by the Corporation, there will be a temporary closure of Melamadai junction-Ring Road stretch of Sivaganga Road from May 31 (Sunday).  From Melamadai junction, Melur Road towards Mattuthavani and Ring Road to reach Sivaganga Road, a statement from police said.  Issues pertaining to drinking water supply aplenty At the special grievance meeting convened by the Corporation for issues related to water supply and drainage, 46 petitions were received from the public and most of whom hailed from the newly-added areas of the Madurai Corporation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The petitioners said that it was necessary to regularly conduct such a grievance meeting as most of their issues had not been taken care of, even after submitting petitions numerous times. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Problems pertaining to the supply of water were aplenty and represented to the Mayor and Commissioner. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R.  Muthu, a resident of the K.  Pudur Industrial Colony in ward 45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“At present, we are only getting water from the Corporation once every eight days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stating that the Corporation had installed a public tap on a patta land belonging to her, D.  Jagadheswari of Managiri said that she had submitted a petition asking for it to be removed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The issue has been there for long.  We hope it will get redressed only when we meet higher authorities directly,” she stated. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
K.  Mohammed Rafiq, a resident of Tahsildhar Nagar, I was asked to meet the fitter who then demanded Rs.27,000.  When I refused to pay, I was told that a connection wasn’t possible to my house since the pipeline was too small,” he alleged. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A resident of T. M.  Nagar near Mattuthavani, S.  Premsingh said that despite the area being thickly populated with many more residential projects on the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“There are so many apartments coming up and we need a proper drainage system in place before more people settle here,” he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A.  Marimuthu, Secretary of the Mangala Vinayagar Nagar Residents’ Association,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strong winds unsettle dust With the last two days being particularly windy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In many areas such as KK Nagar, Anna Nagar, the dust and sand have accumulated on roadsides and near medians, following intermittent rainfall a week back which resulted in accumulation of wet mud on roads.  Heaps of construction materials, including sand, too piled up on roadsides.  S.  Aadityan of K. K.  Nagar said that travelling through 80 Feet Road in the last couple of days had been a tough task due to the heaps of sand near the median which were flying around in the string breeze.  “Despite having the visor of my helmet, the dust has resulted in eye irritations and affected my throat as well,” he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In newly added wards of the corporation where mud roads are yet to be replaced by tar roads and where road laying work is in progress, residents said that the situation is worse.  Vehicle users who cross vantage stretches such as Mattuthavani and Bypass Road on a daily basis said that it was impossible to walk or drive without protecting nose and eyes from the exhaust from vehicles coupled with dust and sand on the roads. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the small streets off Chintamani Road near Anuppanadi, dust from roads under constriction had been constantly swirling about.  “We have been coughing every time we walk on this stretch,” he said, adding there were no immediate plans of procuring more machinery. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Previously, the cleaning work was being carried out by conservancy workers in groups on the roads.  Keeping it safe Wearing helmet is one thing.  But keeping it safe bugs many.  K.  Subbalakshmi, wearing a helmet is going to cause heat retention and hair fall. ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her concerns are echoed by many youngsters who say that it is very uncomfortable to wear a helmet in the hot weather.  A street vendor near Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple says he was witness to many people complaining about their helmets stolen from their vehicles in the last few weeks.  “People have become extra cautious and have started even chaining helmets to their vehicles to prevent them from being stolen,” he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A traffic policeman says many youngsters give excuses such as the sweltering heat and ‘damage’ to their hairstyle for not wearing a helmet.  “Those who are against wearing a helmet must realise that in case of a road accident, the head gear gives a good protection against head injury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the Mattuthavani Bus stand parking lot where many people comprising of marketing and sales representatives as well as college students leave their bikes and board buses to the nearby areas, tokens are being issued for Rs.  5 for safe keeping of helmets. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The shelves were put here after the implementation of the rule a few days back and we are getting more than 150 to 200 helmets everyday to store,” said one of the persons in charge of the parking lot which belongs to the Madurai Corporation but is managed on a private contract basis. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Motorists however pointed out the parking fee for 12 hours was only Rs.  3.  “The cost of keeping our helmets there is much more expensive and for persons like me who travel on a daily basis, we will have to spend a lot every month,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Walkers carry it along,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Early morning walkers at the Vandiyur park in K. K.  Nagar and the Corporation Eco park have been carrying their helmets in their hands and going about their daily exercise routine. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Storage facilities where tokens are issued at nominal prices could be started in all important public places,” said J.  Loganathan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Meenakshi Temple which attracts thousands of devotees on a daily basis is at present, receiving and storing helmets at the free chappal stands near the four main temple tower entrances. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“For now, we are accepting helmets and keeping it here but it will become a problem when there is a rush of devotees.  Separate stands and shelves might need to be set up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 150 buses were hired for bringing party workers to the feast venue and close to 1,000 private vehicles descended on Pandikoil, takes away Rs. 8.95 lakh A three-member gang robbed Rs.  8.95 lakh from a finance company at Lakshmipuram under Vilakkuthoon police station limits here on Saturday. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police said that the three persons, who were wearing helmets, hailing from Kurinji Nagar of Thanakkankulam, who was alone at the office. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The culprits used packing tapes to immobilise him by securing his hands behind and gagged him.  He was bundled into a toilet in the office before the trio laid their hands on the day’s collection.  However, the victim was not harmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrew was counting the money when the trio barged in.  “They took away the money kept on the table and in the drawer,” police sources said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Within a few minutes, Andrew managed to free himself and called his boss in Tiruchi.  “Two of them had taken off their helmets after getting into the office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many private telecommunication companies which had laid underground and OFC cables nearly 10 years ago had accumulated large dues as they had been erring on payment of annual rent to Madurai Corporation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An official said that while the cables were installed with the permission of corporation and the installation costs had been paid, the companies had not paid the rent due to the civic body.  Corporation Commissioner C.  Kathiravan had earlier warned the telecommunication companies about the accumulated dues and gave them a week’s time following which strict action was announced. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As Tata Communication owed Rs 1.20 crore to the corporation, its cables were cut off.  Assistant Commissioner R.  Gunalan supervised the operation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other erring companies too will have their cables cut off in the next few days as they have not responded or paid their dues despite notices.  City police groping in the dark over two murder cases The city police are yet to make a breakthrough in the July 8 murder of a young mother, Preethi (32),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two weeks have passed ever since the police registered a case of murder though the officials then said that the motive of the crime appeared to be looting the house. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Since the family members said that no property is lost or missing from the house, technically we had to register a case of murder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Initially, the family members claimed that two mobile phones were missing from the house.  However,” a police officer said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police perplexed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the police are still perplexed as to what for the gang had rummaged through the cupboards in the house. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another question that still remained unanswered is why one of the gangsters had masked his face unlike others.  The police suspect that he could have been a person familiar to the family members in some way or the other. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 72-year-old Santosh, who has been recuperating from the multiple stab injuries, the police said.  “However, we are leaving no stone unturned,” an officer said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, another murder – of a 30-year-old foreign returnee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The youth was working as an earthmover operator in Singapore.  He returned home only in January.  He was found dead with a single stab injury inside an omni van near the High Court Bench premises on March 29. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interestingly, the van in which he was found dead was a stolen vehicle.  The police suspect that it could be a murder for gain since his gold chain was missing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some criminal elements could have lured the youth with a woman to the secluded place.  “He could have been killed after he resisted the robbery,” the police said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The city police said that the case was being probed by the Serious Crime Wing.

“Since the family members said that no property is lost or missing from the house, technically we had to register a case of murder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Initially, the family members claimed that two mobile phones were missing from the house.  However,” a police officer said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the police are still perplexed as to what for the gang had rummaged through the cupboards in the house. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another question that still remained unanswered is why one of the gangsters had masked his face unlike others.  The police suspect that he could have been a person familiar to the family members in some way or the other. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 72-year-old Santosh, who has been recuperating from the multiple stab injuries, the police said.  “However, we are leaving no stone unturned,” an officer said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, another murder – of a 30-year-old foreign returnee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The youth was working as an earthmover operator in Singapore.  He returned home only in January.  He was found dead with a single stab injury inside an omni van near the High Court Bench premises on March 29. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interestingly, the van in which he was found dead was a stolen vehicle.  The police suspect that it could be a murder for gain since his gold chain was missing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some criminal elements could have lured the youth with a woman to the secluded place.  “He could have been killed after he resisted the robbery,” the police said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The city police said that the case was being probed by the Serious Crime Wing.  REPORTER’S DIARY Passengers of an omni bus from Madurai to Chennai on Wednesday were treated to an ‘entertainment show’ of the Bacchus kind.  A sozzled man began to raise his voice on the bus as it began to move from Mattuthavani omni bus stand.  He demanded that the air-conditioner should be switched on.  The only problem, however, a Madurai suburb. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He finally had to be dropped back at the bus stand.  The attendant said that they had been facing issues with inebriated passengers regularly.  He claimed that they had a strict policy of not allowing drunk people on board to prevent nuisance to other passengers. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She could have been stabbed with either a knife or ‘aruval. ’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since jewels weighing three to five sovereigns were missing, the police suspect it could be a murder for gain. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The S. S.  Colony area is one of the busiest locations in the city and as the news spread around 6 p. m. , a huge crowd gathered near the house. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A senior police officer said that either someone known to the victim might have committed the crime or it could be the handiwork of a habitual offender who might have watched the movement of the woman. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police teams were also gathering other details from the husband, a civil engineer. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Judicial Magistrate Palpandi ordered judicial custody for him and he was taken to the Madurai central prison.  ‘Q’ Branch police unable to obtain inputs from former LTTE cadre K.  Krishnakumar (39), the former militant of the proscribed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) arrested by the police here on July 20 turned out to be a hard nut to crack and the ‘Q’ Branch police could arrest only one person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the special branch team arrested him on the night of July 20 and remanded him in judicial custody, the Q branch police took his custody for four days but could not obtain any valuable information about the possible regrouping of those who had served in LTTE and whether they were trying to revive the movement after it was defeated by the Lankan forces in the civil war in 2009. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
True to the nature of a hardcore militant, he was a hard nut to crack, that too very vaguely,” the sources said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krishnakumar was arrested at the coastal Uchipuli when he came down from Madurai to take a clandestine boat ride to cross over to Talaimannar. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The then Q branch Superintendent of Police K.  Bhuvaneeshwari also tried her best during the interrogation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was waiting at the bus stand and the former militant came near his car after calling him over phone, the sources said.

“We found that a number of calls were coming specifically from Mattuthavani bus stand since it is the hub for movement and crowds.  Hence, we decided to have a booth there with dedicated Childline staff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He said that they were planning to extend the working hours of the booth like throughout night with the help of volunteers. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

City gets regulated market for paddy The first regulated market for paddy in Madurai, secretary, Madurai Market Committee, which operates the market under the control of Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business, said that though regulated market for crops was introduced in the State more than three decades back, this is the first time that a market for paddy had been opened in the southern districts.  Such a facility was functioning in Thanjavur district, and for turmeric in Erode district.  On the opening day, three farmers and three rice mill owners participated in the auction.  According to Mr.  Thavasumuthu, the farmers received Rs.  1,100 per 55 kg of fine quality paddy and Rs.  950 per 55 kg for second quality paddy.  “This is Rs.  100 to Rs.  150 more than what the farmers could have got if sold through the intermediary commission agents,” he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He said that the regulated market for paddy was beneficial for buyers also as they need not pay a commission of 1.5 percent to agents.  Though the transportation cost for bringing in the produce to the market should be borne by the farmers and taking it out after procurement should be borne by the buyers, Mr.  Thavasumuthu said that it would still be profitable for farmers and buyers.  “We have also received written assurance from rice mill owners’ association comprising 128 mills that they would continue to procure from the regulated market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second regulated market for paddy would be opened in Vadipatti on Monday.  The markets in Tirumangalam and Usilampatti would be opened in January.  While the market at Mattuthavani will function every day except government holidays, the market at Vadipatti would function for two days in a week.  Cartels will not be allowed in regulated markets: official The government would not allow formation of cartels by buyers in regulated markets run by Agricultural Market Committees, here on Sunday. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boodhan Pochampally,"Thieves eyeing small temples It appears that burglars were targeting small temples. 
Since August 1, the thieves have looted at least 10 temples in various places.  They broke into a Lord Rama’s temple at Yarragaddagudem and another Lord Rama’s temple at Indlur of Thipparthy mandal on August 1 and took away gold and silver ornaments. 
On the same night, unidentified miscreants gained entry into Gangadevamma temple in Kattangur and took away valuables and ornaments of the presiding deity. 
The miscreants also made a futile attempt to loot another temple located at Muthyalamma Gudem village of Kattangur mandal the same night. 
Four days later, the burglars took away the ornaments and cash from the hundi of Saibaba temple at Aitipamula village in Kattangur mandal and also gained entry into a house located close to the temple and took away some cash.  Ten days later during on Saturday night, the burglars struck again in Anumula mandal. 
They took away ornaments and cash from hundi of Sri Pabbathi Anjaneya Swamy temple, Naidupalem, Sri Swyambu Sambulingeshwara Swamy temple, Peruru and another Anjaneya Swamy temple located at Anjaneya Tanda.  On Sunday night, the burglars struck again in Boodhan Pochampally mandal from where they took away some cash from hundi and Rs.  8,000 worth gold and silver ornaments from goddess Durga Devi temple at Peddarallapally village. 
Speaking to The Hindu , CCS DSP Sunitha Mohan said that they have asked the patrolling police to visit all the temples in their purview in the wake of series of incidents. 
Stating that the burglars were easily gaining entry into these temples since the small temples lack security, Ms.  Sunitha Mohan said that they were closely monitoring the movement of all the old criminals and assured that they would nab the culprits soon. 
However, the DSP said that they were not sure that all these incidents were interlinked.  The CCS Police have nabbed a couple of burglars a month ago who were involved in a series of thefts in temples.

Lack of coordination switches off more than 1000 landlines in Vellore The partial disruption of telecommunication service in Vellore on account of the damage caused to the BSNL cables by the contract workers, engaged in the digging of a trench for laying main pipelines for the Combined Water Supply Scheme (CWSS) on Anna Salai in Krishna Nagar, has exposed the lack of coordination among the various government bodies which have to dig roads for providing services. 
The contract workers dug the trench for the CWSS envisaging bringing water from the Cauvery River near Mettur on behalf of the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board.  The trench was dug for laying a pipeline to connect the existing overhead tank of the Vellore Corporation in Sankaranpalayam so that Cauvery water could be pumped to the tank which supplies water to several wards. 
According to a BSNL official, about 1,200 telephone lines have gone out of order in the Thorappadi and Krishna Nagar areas for the last nearly 15 days on account of the damage caused to the cables.  “We were not informed about the digging of the trench,” said a BSNL official. 
A telephone subscriber said that this problem would not have arisen if the TWAD Board had informed the BSNL about the plan of digging the trench and ensured that the BSNL field staff and officials were present to identify the location of the BSNL cables. 
Another BSNL official said that coordination meetings of government bodies and departments such as the BSNL, the State Highways Department, National Highways and the TWAD Board which are involved in the digging of roads are held periodically.  But the coordination did not percolate to the field level, he said. 
A BSNL official said that the work of restoring the cables has been hampered by the flooding of the trench with drainage water. 
“Several telephone lines have been restored and we are working on a war footing to restore the remaining lines,” he said. 
K. A.  Sankarasivam, president and Gowtham Singhee, Treasurer of the Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum, said that the district administration should take serious note of the issue and ensure that there was better coordination among the various departments in order to avoid damage to public infrastructure and disruption of vital services such as telecommunication and water supply in future.  A coordination meeting should have been held between the TWAD Board and the BSNL officials before undertaking the work, said Mr.  Sankarasivam.  Middle level officials of the concerned departments should have been present while digging the trench, said Mr.  Singhee. 
The executive engineer of the TWAD Board was not available for his comment when this Correspondent tried to contact him.

Krishanraja Sagar,"Krishnaraja Wadiyar’s birth anniversary fete a low The 131st birth anniversary of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar was celebrated in the city on Thursday but was a low-key affair. 
Reckoned to be the architect of modern Mysuru, the region witnessed a slew of developments under him including expansion of agriculture, Railways, establishment of major industries, completion of the Krishanraja Sagar dam, University of Mysore, Sahitya Parishat, State Bank of Mysore, urban and town planning through City Improvement Trust Board, reservation for the backward classes in public services (Miller Committee recommendations) to name a few. 
While the district administration garlanded the statue of the erstwhile king at K. R.  Circle, members of the Ursu community took out a procession with his portrait accompanied by a band.  Similarly, the Mysore Urban Development Authority (erstwhile CITB) paid tributes to its founder. 
The anniversary celebrations were more of a commemoration by garlanding the statue and were devoid of any programme or seminar to assess his contributions to the region.  The former Mayor, Purushottam, took exception to such low-key celebrations which, the officials, attributed to the prevalence of code of conduct due to the gram panchayat elections. 
But it is pertinent to note that there are no official celebrations on a grand scale by the district administration or the government to mark the birth anniversary of Krishnaraja Wadidyar IV though a demand for it is gaining traction in recent years.

The incident occurred when they were heading home to Nhava village after performing the Maha Shivratri pilgrimage. 
They were taken safely to the Belapur hover port and disembarked after a 30-minutes rescue operation by a Coast Guard vessel.  The incident occurred at 4.45pm, around 7.4km off the Mumbai coast, after Navrang hit some rocks.  A defence official said it was not a registered ferry boat service.

The solution was proposed by deputy municipal commissioner J Sinnarkar on Wednesday, as NMMC has been facing the corporators’ ire for not being able to curb the stray population growth.  Sinnarkar added that they will identify the vacant plots for setting up these temporary centres in around three months. 
“In spite of having a sterilization centre, the number of stray dogs hasn’t reduced.  It has now become essential to undertake mass sterilization activities, for which more centres, equipped with all the necessary medical infrastructure, need to be set up on temporary basis in each ward,” said Sinnarkar. 
Officials from the veterinary department said that annually around 14,000 dog bite cases get reported in the city.  Currently, the civic body conducts sterilization programme from the centre set up in Turbhe. 
Dr Deepak Paropkari, chief civic health officer, said that the average monthly sterilization figure of around 450 stray dogs is grossly inadequate in comparison to their reproduction ratio.  “On an average, 1,500 stray dogs need to be sterilized every month, to be able to address their ever-increasing population.  But this cannot happen at the existing centre,” he said. 
The corporators sought an explanation for the increasing population of stray dogs in the city after the administration proposed to procure anti-rabies vaccination.  27 strays neutered by NGO in Elephanta: Activists of NGO In Defense of Animals (IDA) successfully conducted their first sterilization camp at Elephanta Island near Uran, earlier this week by sterilizing 27 stray dogs.  The Gram Panchayat reportedly could not fund this program but they offered IDA two large rooms to conduct the camp.  The NGO is now also planning to conduct several more such camps in far-off places to curb the stray population.  “The municipalities in bigger cities must also conduct multiple sterilizations of stray animals.  This is the best way to keep animal population in check,” said a Vashi-based animal welfare worker.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Finally, a speed boat service from city to Elephanta island  NAVI MUMBAI: After almost two decades, Navi Mumbaikars can use water transport again to visit a sought-after tourist destination in less than half an hour.  An air-conditioned speed boat service has taken off from Retibundar, Belapur to Elephanta Island on Friday.  The service is aimed at Navi Mumbaikars who want to visit the island without taking a detour from Gateway of India.  A first-of-its-kind service from Navi Mumbai, the boat will ferry around 40 passengers at a time and will take around 20 minutes to reach Elephanta.  The service has been launched by Hindjal Pravasi Vahatuk Sahakari Sanstha (HPVSS), a flagship of project affected persons and will cost Rs 200 per head.  Taking four trips a day (see box), the speed boat has an open sitting space under the roof and an indoor air-conditioned cabin.  The 17-km journey will cut down on time, compared to the routes from Gateway and Uran coast, which take over an hour.  “The service was delayed as we had to seek several permissions from various agencies.  Now, citizens can save time and money too,” said Ravindra Patil, president of HPVSS.  “We took the speed boat today and it turned out to be quite a pleasant journey.  Earlier, we used to take train from Nerul to CST then to Gateway of India by taxi, which was very expensive and time consuming,” said Ajit Koli, a Nerul resident.  Cidco had earlier facilitated landing jetty to a private agency to run hovercraft services from Sagar Vihar, Vashi, and Sarovar Vihar, Belapur, to Gateway of India in 1996.  But the service was discontinued a year later.  “Next, we will seek permission to run the service between Belapur and Gateway.  But it will take time, as Gateway does not have a jetty facility for such a high speed boat,” added Patil. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Now, Navi Mumbaikars can save ample time and money, too,” said Ravindra Patil, president of HPVSS. 
“We took the speedboat ride and it was pleasant.  Earlier, we used to take train from Nerul to CST, then to Gateway of India by taxi which was expensive and time consuming,” said Ajit Koli, a Nerul resident.

Ten-year-old swimmer eyes 8 sea routes along Arabian coast  NAVI MUMBAI: Ten-year-old Uran Boy, Raj Patil, will attempt to swim eight long distance sea routes between November 1 and 30 along the Arabian coast, to become the country’s youngest open water swimmer.  “He is aiming to enter the Limca Book of Records.  From December onwards, he will take on international sea routes to complete five more feats till June 2016,” said his father, Santosh Patil, an international swimmer and coach.  Raj will open the marathon with a 24km swim from Kegaon Beach to Kanoji Angre Island, followed by Mora Port to Gateway of India and return on November 4.  The third attempt will be include the swim from Elephanta Island to Mandwa Jetty (21km) on November 6 followed by Revas Jetty to Bhaucha Dhakka (22km) on November 15.  Besides, he will swim from Mandwa Jetty to Gateway of India (15km) on November 18, followed by Raj Bhavan to Gateway (15km) on November 21.  The Rewas Jetty to More Fort swim (22km) will be held on November 25 and the final Belapur Jetty to Gateway swim (25km) on November 30.  The funding for the expedition has, however, been a handicap.  “His school has allowed him six hours off every day for practice and I hope a few philanthropists will come forth to partially aid the adventure,” his father added.

Yet another milestone for city swimmer  NAVI MUMBAI: City swimmer, Raj Patil (10), has bagged yet another milestone by swimming across the 24-km stretch from Mora Port to Gateway of India on Thursday.  Patil touched the gateway and swam back to Mora Port in 8 hours and 54 minutes.  With this swimming expedition, Raj aims to set the record as the country’s youngest swimmer.  “The attempt was quite tough, although it was my practice route,” said Raj.  Impressed by his talent, senior naval officer from Karanja, P K Singh, rewarded Patil with a token of Rs 5,000.  This was followed by Uran MLA Manohar Bhoir presenting Raj with Rs 15,000 to square up a small portion of expenditure for the expedition.  “Raj has become the first swimmer in the country to cross this channel twice in a go in a single day.  Many did the one way swim but Raj made the return trip as well,” said Raj’s proud father, Santosh Patil.  The remaining swimming routes he will cover include Elephanta Island to Mandwa Jetty (21km), Revas Jetty to Bhaucha Dhakka (22 km), Mandwa Jetty to Gateway of India (15 km), Raj Bhavan to Gateway (15 km), Rewas Jetty to More Fort (22 km) and Belapur Jetty to Gateway (25km).

Coast Guard rescues 78 pilgrims off Mumbai coast Seventy-eight pilgrims, who were stranded in a ferry off the Mumbai coast, were rescued by the Indian Coast Guard on Tuesday. 
The pilgrims had gone to visit the Someshwer Shiva temple near the Elephanta Island for Shivaratri on a local passenger craft, ‘Navrang. ’ Around 3.30 p. m. , while returning to the Nhava Sheva port, the vessel’s engine got stuck in a mud patch. 
“In view of the occasion of Shivaratri celebrations, a local passenger craft ferried 78 persons from Nhava Sheva to Gharapuri.  After visiting the Someshwer Shiva temple, when the vessel was making a return journey, it hit a submerged mud patch thereby rendering the engines dead.  The boat subsequently started to become unstable in view of the overcrowding,” stated a Coast Guard press release. 
“The vessel intimated the local police for help and two civil boats were sent immediately, which proved ineffective due to the treacherous navigation conditions.  The Coast Guard was intimated around 4.30 p. m. ,” it said. 
The Coast Guard hovercraft H-197 was pressed into action.  It carried out the rescue and relief operations.  Of the 78 pilgrims, 20 were women and 18 children. 
The Coast Guard claims that the vessel was carrying more people than what was permitted, and was sailing without life-saving equipment on board.  It plans to bring up the issue with the Maharashtra Maritime Board.  Coast Guard rescues 78 people after ferry runs aground near Elephanta Islands Using a hovercraft, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) personnel on Tuesday rescued 78 people –including 20 women and 18 children, after a ferry in which they were travelling hit a muddy patch and ran aground near Elephanta Islands off Mumbai coast on Monday evening. 
The ferry “Navrang”, carrying 40 men, 20 women and 18 children, was on its return journey from Elephanta Islands to Nhava Sheva, when the mishap took place.    “The vessel was an over-crowded boat without any life saving equipment on board and was stranded in low tide,” a senior ICG official said. 
On the occasion of “Mahashivaratri”, the ferry had carried the passengers from Nhava Sheva to Elephanta Island, where Someshwar Shiva Temple is located. 
“After visiting  the temple, all passengers boarded the vessel at about 3:30 pm for their return journey to Nhava Sheva.  The vessel while manoeuvring to leave the jetty, hit a submerged mud patch which rendered the engines dysfunctional,” the official said. 
Before long, the over-crowded boat became unstable.  “The passengers were in no position to reach safety owing to rise in tidal water and surrounding depths.  The vessel operators alerted the police and sought their help,”
One police boat and two civil hired boats were immediately sent to the area which proved ineffective due to the treacherous navigation situation.  The police subsequently got in touch with Coast Guard Regional Headquarters at 4.30 pm. 
As a hovercraft is not restricted by shallow water, Indian Coast Guard hovercraft ACV H-194 commanded by Commandant Sandeep Safaya, was launched with medical and relief material from Belapur Hover Port at 5.05 pm. 
The hovercraft reached the stranded vessel at 5.24 pm and rescued all 78 passengers from the stranded boat by 5:36 pm.  The timely rescue of the passengers by Indian Coast Guard averted any untoward incident.  All the rescued people were provided with relief and were thereafter taken to Belapur Hover Port where they alighted and left safely for their homes.

Amherst Street,"Rats make life hell for Kolkatans  KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation roads and civil engineering department is battling an unlikely foe.  The department has been struggling to repair roads damaged by rodents.  Large parts of central and north Kolkata have been affected by rodents, but residents living in the Amherst street and Baithakkhana market area are the worst sufferers. 
A visit to Guruprasad Chowdhury lane off Amherst Street and Sankar Ghosh Lane adjacent to Vidyasagar College (for women) on Wednesday revealed that these areas are infested with large rats, which dig holes into the lanes and damage the foundation of the houses. 
A poor garbage disposal system has much to do with the rat menace, complained Saswata Pal, a resident of Sankar Ghosh Lane.  Some residents have put up notices requesting neighbours not to dump garbage there, which the rodents feed on. 
A century-old building on Guruprasad Chowdhury Lane, Amulya Niketan, is under threat from the rats, which have also damaged a specially designed three-storeyed building beside Amulya Niketan.  Sanjukta Sen, one of the residents, said that the rat menace was growing by the day. 
“We have been suffering due to the practice of throwing left-overs on the roads.  We have asked our neighbours to stop throwing garbage on the road, but all appeals have fallen on deaf ears,” Sen alleged.  Atin Ghosh, member, mayor-in-council overseeing the KMC civil engineering department said the civic body was trying to take up a befitting method to eliminate the menace. 
“We need to undertake a survey to find out the damage and the routes of the rats.  The solution will follow,” Ghosh said.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Educational institutes blamed for student deaths  KOLKATA: The mysterious deaths of two students in north Kolkata and Salt Lake have turned murkier with their respective families registering FIRs against the educational institutes in which they were studying. 
In one incident, Utpal Raut, uncle of Rammohan College student Payel Naik, filed a case of negligence against the college hostel.  Payel, 18, was talking to fellow boarders when she collapsed.  Doctors at Medical College Hospital declared her dead, saying she had suffered a massive cardiac arrest.  Her mother Minati Naik said Payel was neither ill nor had a medical history.  “We have registered a case at Amherst Street police station,” said Bastav Baidya, DC (north). 
In the other incident, Bidhannagar South police have registered a case under Sec 306 IPC (abetment to suicide) after getting a complaint from Kishalay Das, father of Kamalika Das, 17, a Class-XI student of a central board school who allegedly committed suicide on Friday.  According to Das, Kamalika killed herself because her principal, class teacher and Hindi teacher had suspended her for a week for copying homework.  “We’ll proceed according to evidence,” said a Bidhannagar police officer.

Lakhs of commuters had to get off buses and taxis and trudge the chaotic streets. 
It took more than an hour for vehicles to travel the 6km from Manicktala to Esplanade.  The ripple effect was felt for hours afterwards. 
The blaze spared lives but gutted at least four shops, reducing property and belongings to ashes.  Till late evening, flames were still leaping from charred shops and plumes of smoke cast a blinding haze on the congested business area where shops jostle for space with century-old homes. 
The fire seemed to have started around 4.30pm at a carpenter’s ground-floor workshop that doubled as his home.  Initially, locals tried to douse the flames, but stacks of wood, plywood and adhesive fed the flames that soon spread to other shops. 
Carpenter Hari Sharma had been living in the rented accommodation at 150 Amherst Street for 50 years along with his wife Sona Devi, three sons, their wives and children.  “My son Nagendra’s wife had just stepped out to fetch her child from school when the fire broke out.  We lost everything,” said a distraught Sona. 
Till about 9pm, 35 fire tenders worked tirelessly to put out the blaze.  Police diverted traffic to MG Road to allow easy access for fire engines. 
DC-central D P Singh confirmed that there was no casualty.  Amid the usual murmurs of fire engines reaching late, neighbours and store owners close to the gutted shops were grateful to the fire fighters. 
“Thanks to the firemen, the flames were contained in time.  I shudder to think what could have happened had the blaze spread in such a congested area,” said Jyotsna Banerjee, who lives next to the gutted building where the fire started. 
The third floor of her house did catch fire though.  “A baby was born in our family after years a few days ago.  I heard the baby wailing as the maids ran down the stairs screaming for help.  That’s when we realized that our house was on fire,” said Banerjee.  “I’m grateful that we are all alive. ”
Owners of neighbouring stores sat on the pavements praying for the crisis to blow over.  With electric supply snapped, entire Bowbazar had plunged into darkness. 
Sona Devi, yet to come to terms with the loss, alleged her landlord’s sons had set her home on fire.  “They had given us an ultimatum to evict the room.  They filed a case against us, but lost in court,” said Nagendra. 
Those close to landlord Ashok Shaw, however, trashed the allegations.  Partha Mukherjee, OC of Muchipara police station, said: “We don’t suspect any foul play. ” Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, too, visited the spot.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Ominous signs in Kolkata’s erratic rainfall  KOLKATA: A steady but unpredictable change in weather has rendered Kolkata vulnerable to natural calamities that could affect nearly half of its population, says a study by a green NGO. 
More than 60% people residing along the Ganga would face terrible time in case a powerful storm strikes, it warns.  Essential services like power, water supply and sewage will be cut off in at least 50 municipal wards, the survey says. 
Based on an analysis of Kolkata’s weather over 110 years, Centre for Environment and Development (CED) points out a major change in the city’s rainfall pattern. 
Between 1905 and shows, the earliest onset of monsoon was on May 26, 1937, and the latest on June 25, 1976.  Monsoon was delayed 29 times between 1939 and 1980, but it’s a trend now. 
Till the Nineties, monsoon and rainfall were more or less predictable, it says.  But over the last two decades, onset of monsoon has often been delayed, punctuated by long dry periods.  They have been followed by phases of heavy rainfall towards the end of monsoon leading to severe waterlogging and disruptions. 
“The weather change is perceptible and has made vast stretches of Kolkata vulnerable.  We saw it when Cyclone Aila struck six years ago.  The city’s lack of preparedness was exposed.  If there is a repeat, the consequences could be equally bad,” said A K Ghosh, director of CED, who led the study. 
If heavy rainfall and a storm surge combine with high tide — quite possible in Kolkata’s conditions — it would spell disaster for river-side dwellers.  There is nothing to stop a wall of water from sweeping in. 
Some 50 wards have been identified as most vulnerable.  “This is where the damage could be extensive.  Kolkata’s power installations, water supply facilities, industries, warehouses and slums are concentrated in these wards.  A storm surge can leave the city paralyzed,” explained Ghosh. 
What’s quite worrying.  there is no system in place to tackle a disaster, he says.  “Neither is there a dedicated and trained volunteer corps to deal with climate change-related events.  Evacuation shelters for the population in slum areas are still inadequate,” said Ghosh. 
Garden Reach, Kidderpore and Tollygunge are listed among the most vulnerable.  So are some areas Maidan, Amherst Street, Theatre Road, College Street, MG Road, Ultadanga, Kankurgachi and Phoolbagan.  Even parts of New Alipore, Southern Avenue, Rashbehari Avenue, Deshapriya Park, Shovabazar and Shyambazar may be hit, the study says . 
It is time for Kolkata to have a dedicated disaster management plan and a team to implement it, agrees green activist Subhas Datta.  “The city is expanding towards Sunderbans which acts as the buffer during disasters like Cyclone Aila.  This is all the more reason why we should have a fool-proof plan to deal with such calamities.  Not having one is dangerous,” said Datta.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  IIT-Kgp draws up College St makeover plans  KOLKATA: If the ambitious Barnaparichay project has remained stuck in the doldrums, donât lose heart yet.  A couple of architecture students of IIT-Kharagpur have come up with a ârejuvenation planâ for a 300-metre stretch of one of the cityâs most loved icons: Boipara, aka College Street. 
As things stand now, the future of Boipara as envisaged by the IIT students â green tram tracks on both sides of College Street, a no-traffic zone, adda zones equipped with book and food kiosks â might be more in the realm of high fantasy, but could well become non-fiction. 
The plan by the IIT students, mentored by their teachers, has attracted the urban development ministry, that has agreed to fund the project, even though no one was willing to even indicate what costs are involved.  A source said it was âlikely to run into several croresâ. 
But the ministry, through the Institute of Urban Affairs and the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi (SPA), has already started a dialogue with the state government, said sources. 
The planners hope to execute their design on a 300-metre stretch starting from Surya Sen Street crossing and ending at Mahatma Gandhi Road.  The plan also includes Bankim Chatterjee Street and Bhabani Dutta Lane. 
âThat stretch has been made completely out of bounds for traffic and converted into a pedestrian zone,â said Joy Sen, head of the architecture department, under whose guidance the students, Souradeep Paul and Sweeya Tangudu, worked. 
âOnly the tram tracks have been allowed.  The pavements have been broadened and the book stalls converted into shaded bamboo kiosks,â Sen added. 
The design also caught the eye of Bina Balakrishnan, one of the countryâs best-known traffic flow designers, based in Bengaluru. 
Noticing the potential in the project, Balakrishnan herself studied the traffic flow on College Street and come up with a suggestion: divert traffic to Surya Sen Street and make it emerge from MG Road at the Amherst Street crossing.  âItâs possible.  We have to work it out with the traffic and urban development departments,â she told TOI. 
The adda zones have been specially designed for intellectual discussions, like it used to be on College Street, said the students. 
The project will shape up in partnership with the KMC, since it involves heritage.  âWe are thankful to IIT-Kharagpur for the design.  We are looking forward to thrashing out the details with the Centre, so that the project can be implemented.  It involves a lot of money and we hope to be funded by the ministry,â said mayor Sovan Chatterjee.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Kolkataâs own rescue team is on the job 24X7  KOLKATA: Rescuing is their mission and passion.  Because of their commitment to come to the aid of people in distress even Kolkata Police counts on them as friends in need.  Nitaidas Mukherjee and his team have been working silently in Kolkata on rescue missions for a while now. 
âBe it rescuing an abandoned child or an ailing person found on the street or helping rescue and hospitalization of the injured during disasters like fire, we can always bank on Nitaidas Mukherjee and his team for support.  They are there whenever we require them,â said an officer of Muchipara police station. 
The Muchipara police station called the Dasâs rescue ambulance and the team during the Amherst Street fire on February 2.  The emergency rescue team reached within minutes and assisted the fire fighters and police.  Though firefighters doused the flames efficiently and no casualty was reported, the rescue team stationed themselves there to tend to the minor wounds sustained by the firefighters. 
âThis rescue team is present whenever there is a fire in the city.  Their ambulance is equipped with emergency medicine and first aid equipment.  They are doing a commendable job,â said an official from the fire brigade. 
Nitaidas started his social work as a 10-year-old when he and a friend tended to an ailing boy found near Dhakuria lake.  Nitaidas decided to completely devote himself to social work by founding HIVE India, a non-profitable organization, about two decades ago to rescue the abandoned and the lost, counsel them and help them reunite with their families.  The organization also helped educate street children.  The latest addition to its profile is the 24X7 emergency response unit. 
The unit boasts of 15 regular volunteers trained in rescue operation, apart from those who come and go.  The unit has three fully equipped rescue ambulances as well. 
âEarlier I used to work on my own to help people in distress whenever possible.  When I came across this team I joined it as working as a united force would give a better chance of success,â said Debabrata Chakraborty from Dhakuria, a volunteer. 
The team works in association with the Kolkata Police, organizations like Childline, government agencies like the disaster management group, child welfare committee and others.

Fake notes cloned too close to true  KOLKATA: Counterfeiters in Kolkata have managed to clone six security features â including micro-printing and the security thread â triggering concern among security agencies and the Reserve Bank of India. 
Whatâs unique this time is that the racketeers seem to have painstakingly extracted the security thread from condemned notes that are auctioned by RBI.  These are inserted into fake notes by expert goldsmiths who are hired from parts of Howrah, say sources. 
The Special Task Force (STF) of Kolkata Police is questioning two close aides of an arrested suspect, Chandrasekhar Jaiswal, to find out how they sourced the printing machine.  STF fears that the counterfeit notes came from outside the city because the unit busted at Kankurgachi doesnât have the precision to make such fake notes.  Investigators suspect the criminals downloaded the printing procedure from the internet to produce counterfeit notes at Domjur, Howrah.  Police expect âsome good newsâ by late Friday night. 
âWe want to ascertain how Chandrashekar managed to get hold of the money dice template and thread for rupee notes and foreign currency too.  We have asked RBI if it recently auctioned any scrap items and a list of those who participated in it.  We are in touch with Customs and NIA, too,â said a source, adding that they also want to know if a dice was stolen in 2012. 
So far, STF has found that the gang methodically procured shredded notes auctioned by RBI to extract the security threads.  âYou need master goldsmiths, found in the hundreds in Howrah, to carry out this work.  We have 12 suspects under our scanner,â said an officer.  âIn some fake notes, the security threads were intact.  They look just like the original.  We had to take the opinion of experts to confirm they were fakes. â
What also worries security agencies is the fake foreign currency seized from the gang.  âThe idea was to push them in the Kolkata currency transfer market.  We have asked our informers to get in touch with dealers,â said a source.  The cyber crime wing is trying to retrieve Chandrashekarâs emails that were sent on 20 4G dongles.  The original designs of Turkish, Zimbabwean and Euro notes reached him through email, say investigators. 
Banking and security establishments have confirmed uncanny similarities between the fake notes found on Farakka Express last week and those seized from Amherst Street in Kolkata.  Police went on the overdrive after a private bank recovered fake notes of lakhs in face value during a transaction with a businessman in North Dinajpur.  The seized notes have six basic security features â micro-printing, the Gandhi watermark, green security thread, use of 100% cotton paper, embossing by insertion of intaglio images and the electro watermark â that RBI uses to prevent counterfeiting.  Whatâs most shocking, micro-printing â one of the most important security features â has been compromised. 
Three other key features, including the optically variable colour feature, are still secure.  The fake notes were so perfect that RBI experts took hours to identify each note.  This has led RBI to consider adding other security features that can be detected only under UV rays.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.  Downpour catches Kolkata unawares  KOLKATA: Heavy rain drenched the city and the suburbs on Monday evening.  The short, sharp shower caused waterlogging in some areas of the city and two persons were killed by lightning in Burdwan.  The wind speed being less than 79kmph, the city did not get a Nor’wester.  However, the districts received higher wind speeds.  The Met office said that the possibility of rain on Tuesday, however, is very low. 
A cyclonic circulation building over Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha and Chhattisgarh for a few days triggered the rain.  Hours before the thundershower, Met office had predicted rain for districts in South Bengal. 
“The cyclonic circulation is waning and we expect it to weaken further.  The chances of rain on Tuesday are very low,” said director of Kolkata reg-ional meteorological centre G C Debnath. 
Stretches on EM Bypass were the worst affected on Monday evening, with areas in Mukundapur, Patuli, Kalikapur and Madurdah getting waterlogged and affecting vehicular movement. 
The civic body was also caught unawares as areas like Amherst Street, CR Avenue and College Street localities were also waterlogged. 
Flight operations were hit for over an hour at Kolkata airport as the thunderstorm and lightning lashed Dum Dum.  All departures were halted and five incoming flights were diverted. 
Many Kolkatans welcomed the respite from the heat and humidity.  “I have been waiting for the rain since last Friday.  I hope it rains more often to keep the mercury in check,” said Sushmita Laha of Lake Town. 
But the story was different in the districts.  Suresh (40) and his son Jogu (25) were were at their paddy field in Burdwan’s Searsole when the thunder squall hit the district. 
They rushed to take shelter under a tree but were struck by lightning and died.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  TMC scores brownie points with Kolkata's sewer network upgrade  KOLKATA: Every May, residents of Sukeas Street, Amherst Street and Kesab Sen Street would dread the arrival of monsoon.  Rains always brought with it nightmares for them, flooding streets and even invading homes.  Since last year though, the situation has undergone a sea change.  Overhaul of the main sewer line along APC Road and AJC Bose Road cleared the clogging.  At Hrishikesh Park on Amherst Street, capacity of the drainage pumping station was increased and new pumps were installed.  This has raised the water carrying capacity of the drainage pipelines significantly and monsoon is not synonymous to inundation anymore. 
“The situation has changed dramatically.  Sukeas Street used to get flooded at the slightest downpour.  Water would inundate all homes.  Photographers would rush to take pictures of boats plying on the street.  But now, water recedes quickly,” said 73-year-old Tapan Kumar Lahiri, who grew up in the locality. 
Shilpa Gupta, a research scholar and a resident of Amherst Street, recollected how the locality would stink after a heavy downpour as water would get stagnant for a couple of days.  “While people enjoy monsoon after a spell of scorching heat, monsoon was like a nightmare for residents of Amherst Street.  We would get marooned after spells of heavy shower.  Now with a marked improvement in the drainage network, we are ready to welcome the rainy season,” she said. 
Some though are unhappy because they have lost the opportunity to make a killing.  Lalji Mahato, who has been pulling rickshaws for decades, rued the loss of big bucks during monsoon when he would make in a day as much as he otherwise did in 10 days. 
According to a KMC drainage department official the overhaul of the century-old brick sewerlines along APC Road had made the difference.  “The underground sewerage system along APC Road, which drains water of areas like Bidhan Sarani, Kesab Sen Street, Amherst Street and Sukeas Street, was on the verge of a collapse.  An overhaul of the network increased its capacity.  So the picture has changed,” the KMC official said. 
Being aware of the impact of the drainage development scheme, the Trinamool Congress has made it an elections issue.  The civic cell of the ruling party has put up hoardings and banners across the city claiming that a change in the drainage system has been an achievement of the present civic board. 
Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, who had planned a poll campaign two months ago, had stressed on the issue of waterlogging and its solution during the present civic board’s regime.  “We planned and took measures to free certain areas of the city of waterlogging.  We have become successful as residents in areas such as Amherst Street, Sukeas Street and Camac Street — known as waterlogging-prone areas — have been freed of that sinking feelings,” Chatterjee said. 
The Left Front however, refuses to admit the task as an achievement of the Trinamool Congress board.  On the contrary, Rupa Bagchi, the opposition leader in the KMC, claimed that the Left Front board had conceived a Rs 500 crore sewerage and drainage upgrade plan under JNnURM scheme in 2008 and accordingly work started next year.  “We had planned the project and executed the same in large areas of the city,” Bagchi said.

SFI activists hurt in lathicharge  KOLKATA: The city centre turned into a battlefield following a police crackdown on Left student activists at Rani Rashmani Avenue on Thursday afternoon.  A total 37 students were injured in the police lathicharge, of which four had to undergo CT scan at Medical College and Hospital.  Nine policemen including four lady police officers sustained injuries. 
Sensing the the reactions, police commissioner Surajit Kar Purakayastha held a press meet in the evening to explain under what circumstances the police had to take steps.  The Left student organisations had taken out the rally on the second death anniversary of SFI leader Sudipto Gupta demanding a judicial inquiry.  Sen died in custody two years ago, while being taken to prison in a bus, after a similar law violation programme. 
The student rally was peaceful in the entire stretch from College Square to Rani Rashmani Avenue with senior policemen — the joint CP and several DCs — were seen walking the streets in front.  A huge barricade was put up at Rani Rashmani Avenue to stop the rallyists at this point.  Unarmed policemen stood behind the barricade. 
Seeing the elaborate police arrangements ahead a section of SFI students began breaking law by removing the barricades placed on the sides of the thoroughfare.  While some pushed ahead, the policemen standing behind tried to push them back leading to a scuffle.  Little did the agitators know that a team of lathi wielding policemen would charge them from behind.  These policemen came from along the Dorina Crossing end and lathicharged the students.  Taken aback by the sudden attack, some retraced their steps while others joined in a counter attack taking out the poles tied to the SFI flags.  A policeman was found daring the crowd.  Later he gave them a chase and was caught in the mob. 
Many students who broke their head in the clash cursed the police that lathicharged the unarmed students.  “Police unleashed a reign of terror today.  They were in a combative mood from the very beginning.  Police hit SFI state committee member Soumen Mitra on his head while he stood beside me.  Today’s incident is a sad commentary on the state’s law and order,” said SFI all India general secretary and CPM MP Ritabrata Banerjee.  Later, CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra and Left Front chairman Biman Bose paid a visit to the hospital. 
The police commissioner didn’t mention about the lathicharge.  He only said that the police had to take steps against a group of SFI students who were trying to push through the barricades and heading towards Raj Bhavan.  “When SFI representatives had come to us asking permission for the rally, we told them to defer the date because the President of India was in town and he was staying at Raj Bhavan.  They kept insisting on holding the rally to mark the death anniversary of their leader Sudipto Gupta.  We had to guard the area around Raj Bhavan for obvious reasons.  There was a magistrate on the spot and buses to take the agitators in custody after law violation,” the commissioner said. 
Claiming that the police were transparent, the police commissioner dished out the “unedited CCTV footage of the incident. ” The footage captured at around 3.12 pm showed SFI activists were being pushed back.  The main aluminium barricade had unarmed policemen behind it.  It was not clear though what prompted these students to retrace their steps.  It revealed that SFI activists were taking out poles from the flags and throwing them at the police.  “They also pelted stones at the police.  Since the President is in town, we had to take steps to control the mob,” the police commissioner said.  Additional officer in charge Amherst Street Manoj Jha sustained serious injuries.  Police have recorded a case in the New Market Police Station. 
While SFI all India secretary held that Sudipto was “killed in custody” two years ago, the police commissioner read out excerpts of the inquiry report that indicated that the student leader might have hit a light post on the way to prison while he was leaning out of the bus taking student activists to jail.

Apart from India, the racket was active in the US and Canada, where the gang lured clients with offers to service computers at nominal rates.  Two of the fraudsters â Sanjay Mandal and Sanky Jaiswal â were arrested on Saturday. 
The gang, which duped hundreds over the last six months, used a method commonly used by professionals to serve overseas clients.  Initially they built a large database sourced from companies based in Sector V in Salt Lake.  Based on this database, Mandal called up people in India, the US and Canada. 
Using the alias Daniel, Mandal told them that their computers have junk files and cookies that can harm it and enable data theft.  He offered to clear the files and make the machine run at an optimum speed for a nominal charge.  According to police, the gang charged around $100 for each cleaning. 
Mandal, a resident of Murshidabad, and Jaiswal, a resident of Kolkataâs Amherst Street, rented two flats at Rabindrapally in Kestopur, which served as their office.  After the âclientsâ agreed to pay the amount, Mandal asked them to click open a software called TeamViewer.  TeamViewer is used by professionals to provide remote servicing and hence there was nothing to suspect.  Through TeamViewer, Mandal got remote access to the clientâs computer and hacked it.  Then he stole important data, including bank account details and passwords. 
Mandal apparently admitted to police that he stored the password and used it to steal data after the computer was serviced.  While the system was hacked, no junk files were deleted.  The amount due with the client was then transferred to a receiver based in the US.  The receiver later transferred the amount to a money transfer agency.  Police believe international money transfer agencies are also involved in the racket. 
But the fraud did not end there.  Mandal called up the client once again, posing as a government employee.  He claimed that the client had been cheated and that the fraud had been detected by the âanti-scam branchâ.  The organization would give the money back if the person agreed to pay the charges required for transferring funds back to him.  Some of the âclientsâ agreed and wired the money. 
âBased on definite leads, we set a trap to arrest them from Kestopur.  We think a bigger gang is involved and are trying to crack the rest,â said Arka Banerjee, ACP, Airport Zone II.  The duo had also roped in a few NGOs in the racket.  The US-based agents and money transfer agencies were given a part of the amount as âcommissionâ.  Police recovered eight credit and debit cards, a swiping machine, a laptop, a few dongles and three handsets.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Films make stamps post perfect  KOLKATA: What’s the connection between a cell phone, a stamp and an actress? Difficult, unless one is aware of Austrian-American actress Hedy Lamarr.  During World War II, she along with composer George Antheil developed spread spectrum and frequency hopping.  The principles of her work have been incorporated into modern Wi-Fi, CDMA and Bluetooth technology.  She was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.  A stamp released on her from Austria happens to be among the thousands of others in the collection of Kolkata-based philatelist Dipok De.  The grand old man of Indian philately and one of the founder members of Cine Central is now working on an as-yet untitled English book on cinema and stamps. 
Seated in his office on the ground floor of a residential apartment on Amherst Street, 78-year-old Dipok De knows about the history of world cinema like the back of his palm.  Clad in a batik punjabi and a lungi, De runs his fingers through his greying beard as he points at the stamp folders and says, “India was the first country to design a stamp on Charlie Chaplin!”
Born in Chittagong, De had shifted to Burma during his childhood.  That’s where he got smitten by the film bug before coming to Kolkata where he enrolled into the Indian College of Arts and Draftsmanship.  Thereafter, he opened his own advertising firm and used to work on ads that were published in newspapers abroad.  “In 1990, I wanted to host a national exhibition called Cinepex.  But few stamps on world cinema were available then.  So, I had to include other personalities.  The scenario changed in 1995.  The world celebrated the centenary of Lumiere Brothers,” he informs. 
The advent of emails, however, was a blessing in disguise.  “To survive, post offices worldwide tapped on the interest in cinema to issue stamps that would appeal to collectors.  The maximum number of stamps was released on Marilyn Monroe! I personally have 200 stamps on her,” De says. 
Some countries issued real gold, silver and platinum stamps too.  “I’ve a gold-plated stamp on ‘Gone With The Wind’,” De proudly shows while ruing the fact that India still hasn’t cashed in on this trend because of bureaucratic issues.  “African countries have stamps on Amitabh Bachchan, Mithun Chakraborty and Kajol.  Republique De Guinee has a stamp on Aishwarya! But we don’t.  In India, the maximum number of stamps released on a film personality is just two.  That was for Satyajit Ray,” he says.  De had designed Ray’s commemorative stamp by using a still from ‘Pather Panchali’, a profile of Ray and the Oscar.  “I’m the only Indian to have designed a stamp for the United Nations.  It was issued on November 22, 1985,” he says.

Oscar? It was George Bernard Shaw! And De has a stamp commemorating that too! Apart from stamps on personalities like Federico Fellini, Andrzej Wajda, Greta Garbo, Michael Jackson, Raj Kapoor, Uttam Kumar, Ritwik Ghatak, Nargis and Smita Patil, De also has stamps on how to make a film! Multiple stamps on the Harry Potter franchise (including one released by China) and ‘Lord of the Rings’ find space in his treasure trove.  How does he keep track of stamps on recent movies? Does his grandson help? “No, he is too young though he likes stamps on ‘Finding Nemo’ and Mickey Mouse.  Stamp catalogues help me spot the new releases,” he says. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once he spots a stamp there is no escaping the pleasurable itch to possess it.  “The stamp on ‘King Kong’ came in a folder that made a loud sound once it was opened.  A decade earlier, I had bought it for Rs 15, while opening the elaborate ‘King Kong’ folder. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kolkata submerged in Monsoon blues  KOLKATA: After a nightlong downpour, Kolkata woke up to a rain-drenched morning on Saturday, crisscrossed with streets resembling canals, complete with rubber dinghies in some parts.  Residents were seen striving to reach their workplaces, wading through knee- or waist-deep water or pleading with cabbies and rickshaw-pullers to ferry them.  But the worst is apparently yet to come: The Alipore weather office has predicted heavy rainfall in south Bengal in the next 48 hours, which will be coupled with high tide.  The tide chart at Garden Reach forecasts that the Ganga may surge beyond 6 metres over two days, like it did on Saturday.  While the rainfall recorded at various pumping stations in the city varied between 96mm at Thanthania and 161mm at Maniktala in the past 24 hours, the picture on the ground did not quite reflect the difference.  For instance, Thanthania and Amherst Street went under waist-deep water in the morning, though rainfall was min mum in the locality.  Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee or his colleagues may blame the incessant rain and high tide to sweep the infrastructure gaps under the carpet, but the real reason for waterlogging becomes clear when one takes a look at the functioning of the pumps installed in the 20 stations across the city.  According to the KMC report, 40% of the installed pumps did not operate on Saturday, the worst being those at Ballygunge and Topsia.  Only four of the nine pumps functioned at the Ballygunge pumping station and five out of 11 at Topsia.  The flood scene improved slightly later in the day when a stream of frantic calls reached civic officials from councillors to municipal chairperson Mala Ray, urging to step up action.  Those living on Prapaditya Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Kalighat and Tollygunge said the roads in the area were flooded after 10 years, the last time being in 2005.  “Our pumps are running.  But if you look at the areas, you will find they are all close to the Adi Ganga and Tolly Nullah.  The two channels are overflowing as the Ganga is on high tide,” said Ray.  KMC officials, however, hinted at a major lapse on the part of the sewerage and drainage department.  “The corporation imported pumps for the Ballygunge Pumping Station way back in 2008 for Rs 20 crore.  They are all lying idle as the machines couldn’t be integrated with the existing system,” a civic official said.  Certain areas in the mayor’s ward in Behala have started resembling large water bodies, with stretches from Taratala near the Old Mint to Barisha and Thakurpukur along the Diamond Harbour Road being inundated.  The overflowing open drains in many of these wards can’t reportedly flush out the rainwater.  Councillors in the Behala wards have pressed into service 12 submersible pumps to drain out the filthy water into the Begor Khal, but with little effect.  The two canals — Begor Khal and Charial Khal — that drain out the water from south and south-west Kolkata are full to the brim and so, no more water can be drained into it.  The worst-affected areas are all located along canals— Bagjola, Circular canal breaking up into Beliaghta and Kestopur canal, Tolly’s Nullah, Municipal Stormwater Drainage Channel, Begor Khal and Charial Khal.  Most of these canals are still silted, despite the KMC and the state irrigation department undertaking dredging operation there under the Kolkata Environment Improvement Project (KEIP).  The clean-up operation did not go according to plans, as the authorities couldn’t clear the encroachments on the canal beds, eating into their water-carrying capacity.  Moreover, instead of dredging the canals, some people, with reported patronage of local Trinamool councillors, filled part of the Beliaghata canal.  Even areas, such as Salt Lake, Sector V, were submerged though the water receded in the afternoon after the Nabadiganta authorities used submersible pumps to flush out rainwater.

Rs 100 to ply 250m of Kolkata's waterlogged Sector V  KOLKATA: The city returned to the rickshaw age on Saturday with buses, taxis and autos staying away from the flooded streets.  Rickshaws charged taxi fares to take commuters to office and people had no other option but to pay up.  Some had to shell out Rs 100 for a 250m-ride from Chingrihata More along EM Bypass to IEM House.  Rates were determined by the level of waterlogging â Rs 40 for stretches with ankle-deep water and Rs 100 and above for knee-deep water. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mystery death in private hostel  KOLKATA: Months after Presidency University post graduate student Sumantika Banerjee died a mysterious death – probably due to gas poisoning – another student died under questionable circumstances at a private hostel located on MG Road near Amherst Street in central Kolkata on Tuesday morning.  The victim has been identified as one Kaustab kumar Maity (21), a final year Mathematics Honours student studying at the St.  Paul's College. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to police sources and other boarders at the hostel, the victim hails from Sabong in West Midnapore.  The police said that Maity was sleeping in his room with his room -mate when his co-boarders heard a loud thud.  His room-mate woke up to realize that Maity was lying on the floor unconscious.  He immediately informed the boarders and Maity was rushed to the Medical College where he was declared brought dead. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have sent the body for postmortem and a case of unnatural death has been initiated.

At the time of death though, he was lying on the floor and was on his back, mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Friday asked the state agencies to start repair process on war footing and end it by the end of September, well before Durga Puja.  Member, mayor-in-council overseeing KMC roads, Ratan De, started surprise visits to the spots where road repair is being carried out.  Some of the major roads under scanner include Diamond Harbour Road, Ultadanga Main Road, Manicktala Main Road, Canal (East) Road and Kasba connector to the EM Bypass.  The mayor asked De to ensure that some roads beside tram tracks are also repaired.  De said tram tracks on Bidhan Sarani, Amherst Street and Rabindra Sarani will be taken care of as well.  In Salt Lake, the three-km connector from Chingrihata to Wipro More will also get a fresh look before the Pujas.  Some parts of the stretch have been damaged due to the ongoing New Garia-Airport Metro construction.  Officials of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) said the Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation (KMRC) has agreed to pay for the damaged spots.  NDITA will beautify the entire stretch after repair work is completed.  “The KMRC will pay to repair the damaged spots below the flyover.  We will then beautify the stretch,” said NDITA executive officer Badrinarayan Kar.  According to plans, the bituminous laying work will take place below the flyover near Wipro and patch work will be taken up on the damaged places upto Chingrihata.  The median divider on the entire stretch from Chinrighata to J K Saha Bridge at Nayapatti to the Sector V junction will be beautified with plants and trees.  The Nabadiganta flyover will also be renovated and beautified.  NDITA authorities have estimated a budget of about Rs 12 crore for the project.  At present, the road has narrowed due to barricades and construction material.  Potholes and craters add to the problem.  NDITA also has plans to lay a mastic asphalt coating on all roads in Sector V to give them better durability.  Sector V has a road network of around 20km, along with the new ring road stretch connecting SDF Building More to 215A bus stand near the New Town entry point.  The authorities have already laid mastic asphalt on a 12km stretch. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Karwa Chauth, Navratri a hit with Bengalis  KOLKATA: Friday evening saw a decked up Ruchira Basu Dutta of Bhowanipore scanning the overcast skies through a sieve in search of the moon.  She had fasted throughout the day for Karwa Chauth, a ritual observed by married Hindu women across north and west India.  Ruchira, however, is not the only Bengali woman to have observed the predominantly non-Bengali ritual. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And it is not just Karwa Chauth that Bengalis have taken to observing with enthusiasm.  A large number buy jewellery and other items during Dhanteras, an essentially north Indian custom and more and more Bengali weddings now include âmehendiâ and âsangeetâ ceremonies.  This is not just the effect of Hindi TV serials,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During Durga Pujas, Bengali youth make up a substantial part of those participating in raas-garba (popularly known as dandiya dance) as part of Navratri celebrations.  The Gujarati custom has become a universal affair now. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Duttaâs observance of Karwa Chauth for the last five years has rubbed off on the other married women of her household.  This year, she even had her husbandâs grandmother from Tarakeshwar over for the celebrations.  Right from fasting the whole day to preparing the special food and prasad for Karwa Chauth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nilanjana Goenka nee Bhattacharya is yet another example.  Though she married into a Marwari family, she was under no compulsion to observe Karwa Chauth.  âI see so many women in my apartment block doing it and I donât want to miss out on the fun.  This is my 11th year and I thoroughly enjoy it, has been observing Karwa Chauth with her neighbours since last year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kolkataâs jewellers are now preparing for the rush of customers during Dhanteras, which has become quite a craze in the city over the past decade.

But these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KOLKATA: While the majority of married men agree with the concept of their wives fasting for them, over a third think they do it to keep the in-laws happy.  The data was revealed in a new survey on Karwa Chauth by a matrimonial portal.  The participants, include residents of Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai among other cities. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When married men were asked if they understood the concept of Karwa Chauth, 58.8% of them said yes.

However, when asked if they agreed with the concept of Karwa Chauth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is surprising that only 35.7% of married men, when asked why women fast for them, said it was âto keep their in-laws happyâ.  The rest said âIt is just another customâ. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“We are trying to find out how special parkings — usually handed over to individuals with physical disabilities or other health issues — are being illegally used by the parking mafia.  There is a possibility that during renewal of these licenses, the actual person who has been issued the license does not even turn up.  Add to it the tendency of illegal parking techniques that cut down road space to allow for more parking space,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police are also asking people to lodge complaints about illegal parking in the city through their Facebook page and upload such videos.  “If somebody is charging money for getting a person’s vehicle parked and not issuing a receipt in return, the public can tell us about it through our Facebook page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zainabia Imambara,"PIL questions Bhendi Bazar shrine ‘sale’ in Mumbai  MUMBAI: The protest against the alleged sale of Zainabia Imambara, a two-storey shrine at Bhendi Bazar, has reached the Bombay high court with the filing of a public interest litigation questioning it. 
The PIL filed by Kishwar Mirza, an advocate, has relied on an “owner’s letter of consent” given on April 21, 2010, by the Zainabia Trust’s managing trustee and builder, Akhtar Rizvi to the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) authorising it to seek redevelopment permission.  SBUT is redeveloping buildings in the area.  Mirza alleged that Rizvi had done this “with oblique motives’’ to cause monetary benefits for himself and wrongful loss to the Shia community. 
Mirza’s petition said she learnt about the sale during Moharrum last November after pamphlets were distributed condemning it.  The charity commissioner office thereafter issued documents confirming that Zainabia was a public trust for the community’s benefit.  Mirza moved the HC, saying a trust which was a public religious endowment can neither be sold nor third party rights can be created as it belonged to the community at large, and also without following due process of law.  Mirza’s petition said she learnt about the sale during Moharrum last November after pamphlets were distributed condemning it. 
Mirza said the plot, known as Babar Ali Imambara, was in existence for over 100 years.  It is visited by Shias throughout the year for attending religious lectures and worship.  She said SBUT “in the guise of redevelopment and so-called cluster development” has been purchasing buildings in the vicinity of Zainabia Trust to “house community members and oust non-Bohra community members’’. 
The PIL said religious feelings and sentiments of Shias had been hurt and a Zainabia Bachao Committee was formed “condemning and protesting’’ against the sale of the Imambara.  Mirza urged the HC to direct the respondents not to sell or create third party rights in favour of SBUT or any trust, and also Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation not to grant demolition/redevelopment permission.  Advocate Shehzad Naqvi on Wednesday cited urgency to a division bench of Justices V M Kanade and Revati Mohite-Dere, which posted the hearing on January 29.

Bellada Bagewadi,"Take advantage of government schemes, seers tell farmers Heads of religious institutions in Hukkeri taluk launched a campaign to instil confidence among small and marginal growers in distress to prevent them from attempting suicide. 
On Friday, heads of Lingayat mutts and other religious institutions formed a forum titled ‘Mathadeeshara Nadige Raitharedege’ and travelled across 51 villages of the taluk from 10 a. m.  to 8 p. m. 
During their visits to villages, the seers interacted with growers and village elders and advised them to manage their resources properly and take best advantages of government schemes to improve their financial condition. 
The campaign was led by Sri Chandrashekhar Shivacharya Swami of Hiremutt, Hukkeri.  Sri Kashinath Swami of Ghodageri Virakta Mutt, Sri Mallaiah Swami of Shivanand Mutt, Shivanand Swami of Bellada Bagewadi and Shri Siddeshwar Shivacharya Swami of Khanapur Ullagaddi were present. 
The farmers were also advised on crop rotation, drip irrigation, watershed development, dairy development and organic farming practices to save the cost on fertilizer and pesticides.  They said the farmers should avoid taking loans at high interest rates from moneylenders and get interest-free loans provided by the government.  The forum also decided to join a people’s delegation to the Deputy Commissioner’s office to pressure the government for obtaining an early verdict on the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project from the Mahadayi Waters Dispute Tribunal, in Belagavi on August 13.

Aakulam,"Bio innovation centre to aid disease research, diagnostics With the inauguration of a bio innovation centre here on Sunday, the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) is set to acquire a new platform for high-end disease research and diagnostics. 
Scheduled to be dedicated to the nation by Union Minister for Science and Technology Harsh Vardhan at the KINFRA Film and Video Park near here, the facility constitutes the first phase of a Rs.100-crore project aimed at creating an ecosystem for fundamental research in disease biology and molecular medicine.  Spread over 50,000 sq ft, the building has platforms for next generation genetic sequencing, high-end bio-imaging and molecular diagnostics. 
“The burden of viral diseases is seen to be increasing at the global level.  While Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome have been reported from several countries, Kerala’s encounter with bird flu and influenza virus and the possibility of new strains pose threats, highlighting the need for development of vaccines,” says M.  Radhakrishna Pillai, Director, RGCB. 
Four focus areas
The bio innovation centre will focus on four broad areas, namely laboratory medicine and molecular diagnostics, microbiome biology, chemical biology, and viral disease biology.  The first thrust area involves the application of molecular sciences for disease management.  Researchers at the centre will collaborate with clinicians to understand the impact of microbial genetic material on diseases such as cancers, diabetes, and schizophrenia. 
Another major focus of the research programme is the development of synthetic anti-microbial peptides to overcome antibiotic resistance and the application of biodegradable polymers as nanoparticles for controlled release of anticancer drugs and targeted delivery of drugs.  The viral disease biology programme is expected to result in the development of potent viral vectors for varying applications. 
The second phase of the project slated to come up at Aakulam includes an advanced centre for molecular and cellular therapeutics and a 75-bed hospital to be operated in collaboration with the Regional Cancer Centre for clinical trials on cancer vaccines and methods such as stem cell therapy and gene therapy. 
It will also provide business incubation facilities for biotechnology start-ups.  Tender processes for the campus are in the final stages, Dr. Pillai said.  Energy conservation awards The Kerala State Energy Conservation Awards 2015 have been announced.

56 applicants save 77 mu of power, 9610 tonnes of oil, 209 tonnes of LPG Centre will consider Rs 100 crore bio lab for Kerala: Harsh Vardhan THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Centre will seriously take into consideration Kerala government's plea for setting up a bio-safety lab in the state at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore for virus testing, Union Minister for Science and Technology Dr Harsh Vardhan today said. 
The Minister's assurance came in response to a request from Chief Minister Oommen Chandy while dedicating the first phase of Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) Bio-Innovation Centre (BIC) at the KINFRA Film and Video Park at nearby Kazhakootam. 
"" It is the responsibility of the government to ensure public health and safeguard public interest,""  Vardhan said adding he would look into the feasibility of setting up the bio-safety lab on his return to Delhi. 
He pointed out that the bio-technology (BT) sector had grown 70 per cent in the country, and in 10 years it was expected to reach USD 100 crore, with production pushing it to the third biggest industry, ahead of the pharmaceutical industry. 
By 2025, the country was set to be the third biggest global player in the field of BT, which works in disease prevention and producing vaccines, he said. 
"" The RGCB creates and trains the best manpower and brings scientific research into the public domain,""  Dr Vardhan said. 
"" Time bound R&D should be done here,""  Chandy, who delivered the presidential address, said pointing out that virus testing for Kerala was now done in labs in Pune and Bhopal. 
"" A bio-safety lab will be beneficial not just for Kerala, but for all of south India,""  the Chief Minister.  "" Diagnostics and testing for disease is mandatory for Kerala, which plays host to migratory birds and visitors from different places.  When Kerala was hit by epidemic, the RGCB played a valuable role in diagnostics,""  he noted. 
RGCB director, Dr M Radhakrishna Pillai, unveiled plans to set up a 75-bed facility with the help of Thiruvananthapuram Medical College's Regional Cancer Centre at Phase II of the BIC Aakulam centre. 
The sprawling facility at phase one, spread over 50,000 sq ft, has advanced platforms for next generation genetic sequencing, high-end bio-imaging as well as a state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics facility that serves Kerala and neighbouring states. 
The facility has also signed an MoU with the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment that will enable the Kottayam-based Srinivasa Ramanujam Institute for Basic Sciences to do research here.

Cornfield Road,"HC raps KMC over city’s dirty streets  KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Friday came down heavily on Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) over the heaps of plastic and garbage piled up along city stretches.  Chief Justice Manjula Chellur held that the plastic packs are a major reason behind Kolkata’s waterlogging problem. 
“I have seen heaps of plastic scattered in and around my bungalow, something I have never encountered in any other metro.  What is the corporation doing? Are they sleeping? They should step up vigilance over plastic dumping and mechanize the garbage clean up process,” the Chief Justice said.  She directed KMC to submit a plan, within a fortnight, about what steps it is taking to prevent waterlogging in the Monsoon. 
The court warning comes at a time when Narendra Modi is urging state governments and urban local bodies to take steps to clean up public places under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. 
State counsel Tapan Mukherjee drew flak from the bench of Chief Justice Chellur and Justice Joymalya Bagchi when he pointed to the chronic waterlogging in Mumbai.  “This is a negative attitude of looking at things.  You should address the problem with a positive mindset and take steps,” Justice Bagchi said. 
KMC lawyer Alok Ghosh informed the court that the civic body has already taken up a host of measures for the overall development of the city.  Ghosh pointed to stretches such as Lord Sinha Road, Southern Avenue, Panchanantala, South End Park in Garia, and Cornfield Road where the water logging problem has been solved.  Having said that, the lawyer informed the court that the city’s population had increased manifold since the British set up the infrastructure.  However, the KMC lawyer did not use this as plea to evade the problem. 
“We have done quite a few things.  We have the status report ready.  I will submit a report on the steps taken,” Ghosh said. 
The Howrah Ganatantrik Samity had moved the court in 2007 seeking direction from the high court to restrict use of plastic and a ban on the plastic manufacturing units in the city to counter the water logging problem.  It had also asked for desiltation of canals and open drains, as well as removal of encroachments on canals to free up the sewage flow channels.

Phulewadi Road,"Cops finalise 8 immersion procession routes  KOLHAPUR: The district police administration on Friday announced eight procession routes for 550-odd Ganesh mandals towards Panchganga Ghat for immersing idols. 
The routes have been planned according to the distance of the mandal from the immersion site and avoid congestion caused by the spectators following the processions.  The traffic department has marked diversion points at many places as well as the routes that will be totally closed for vehicles during the procession for easy passage of the pedestrians through the congested areas. 
Officials of the city traffic department said a week-long survey was conducted to finalise the routes.  Since many mandals emphasised on decongestion of roads during immersion processions in the internal parts of the city, especially in Mangalwar Peth and Rajarampuri, the traffic department has made changes by installing barricades at alternative places which may also help decrease the procession time. 
R R Patil, police inspector of the city traffic department, said, “We will deploy 97 policemen to control traffic along the procession routes.  Moreover, 40-odd traffic police personnel will also monitor the traffic flow along regular routes that get clogged because of heavy rush towards the procession routes.  We have directed the policemen to strictly monitor the routes to avoid any untoward incident. ”
Meanwhile, squares along major roads have been considered entry points for the processions.  For instance, Gokhale College chowk will be the entry point for the mandals from areas such as Udyamnagar, Rajarampuri, Daulatnagar and Takala.  The administration has planned alternative procession routes to facilitate the mandals catch up with other mandals along the main procession route. 
“The decongestion efforts along Phulewadi Road will be undertaken by placing barricades at a couple of points to avoid pedestrians’ direct entry in the processions.  We have planned the procession routes for around 24 hours during which most of the mandals will immerse their idols,” Patil said. 
Meanwhile, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has made alternative arrangements for idol immersion at Irani Khan, Kotitirth lake and Rajaram Bandara.  A pandal has been set up at the river ghat for accepting the idols to avoid their release into the river, which leads to pollution. 
“The major concern pertaining to repair of the roads damaged along the procession routes has been addressed.  Besides, hawkers or any other vendors too have been completely prohibited on the routes,” stated a press release issued by the KMC. 
Moreover, the administration has prohibited parking along 100m from all procession routes and the ones approaching the main routes.  Parking facilities will available at Bindu Chowk, Siddharthnagar and Dasara Chowk.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

According to the police, a neighbour called up Gomathiammal’s son Nandakumar in Chennai that articles were strewn all over in the house.  When he cross-checked with another neighbour, he was told that Gomathiammal was found murdered. 
The neighbour also told him that a bureau in his house had been forced open and articles from it were strewn all around. 
Nandakumar rushed to Arakkonam and lodged a complaint with the Arakkonam town police. 
An ear-stud worn by Gomathiammal and her cell phone were missing.

Gulati Chowk,"80mm rainfall opens the floodgates  LUDHIANA: Eighty-mm rainfall on Thursday was too much for city roads, with most of the stretches getting water-logged, leaving commuters a harried lot.  With Ludhiana municipal corporation allegedly forgetting to clean up the drains, 3 hours of rain caused a lot of chaos on roads.  Traffic flow was hit hard.  Residents complained that there were many areas in which MC did not take up the task of cleaning the drains ahead of monsoon season.  Somnath Grover, a resident of Model Town, said, "" Every year MC somehow cleans the drains before monsoon, but this year they didn't do so.  Our area was flooded within few hours of rains.  Till afternoon there was no help from MC to help residents. ""  The water-logged areas included New Lajpat Nagar, Model Town, Model Town Extension, Dugri, Civil Lines, Sarabha Nagar, Gurdev Nagar, Old City, Gill Road.  Several areas housing offices of city top officials --- police commissioner, DC office, MC office --- were also left battling water woes.  Sudeshna Singh, a resident of Dugri, said, "" It took me an hour to reach old city from my home due to slow movement of traffic due to water-logging.  MC has left no stone unturned to make Ludhiana roads flooding. ""  Officials in the control room, set up to take complaints of water-logging, said they did not receive any complaints regarding water-logging on Thursday.  But residents across the city said nobody in MC responded to their complaints.  "" I tried to complain about water-logging in my area on every possible number of municipal corporation.  They said when the rain will stop, MC staff will be there to solve the problems.  MC Ludhiana is never going to learn any lesson to deal with monsoon.  It seems, we are destined to bear the brunt throughout our lives,""  said Manjit Kalia, a resident of New Shimlapuri.  Additional commissioner Kamlesh Bansal said, "" We held an immediate meeting.  We have designated officials to insure residents don't face any problem in the future.  Motors will be installed especially in low-lying areas to flush out rainwater.  Apt manpower will be deployed to solve problems of water-logging as soon as these are reported. ""  Along with waterlogging and traffic jams, poor condition of roads added to the worries of residents.  "" These roads have become more dangerous and slippery.

Potholes are everywhere and due to the monsoon it has become dangerous for commuters, especially on two-wheelers.  There is also no arrangement for streetlights in the evening. 
"" Due to the potholes and waterlogging, I met with an accident.  I was stuck there for five minutes and that led to traffic jam.  People kept honking, but nobody came forward to help me.  It was only after a passerby saw my struggle and came forward to help,""  said Rashmi, a student of GNIMT, Model Town.

Khapri Lake,"Multimodal International Hub For Birders  NAGPUR: Several years on, the Multimodal International Hub Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN), a special economic zone for industries, may be looked upon as a symbol of development – or perhaps the lack of it — by now, but for young naturalists it continues to be an intrinsic birding destination. 
Many known names from city fondly recollect having started bird watching from the historic Telhara and Dahegaon lakes, built by the Bhonsla rulers.  Part of Mihan now, these lakes and its periphery continue to enthusiastically draw birdwatchers. 
Veteran bird expert Gopal Thosar, and a Nagpur Heroes awardee, recalls, “In 1975, when I started bird watching, thousands of resident and migratory birds use to flock these lakes, which then typically was a woodland.  Poachers from the city too were active and used to lure village boys by offering them Rs 5 per bird.  I sensitized these boys and managed to stop poaching. ”
Today, the beauty of both the lakes and adjoining areas have faded with development.  Too much construction activity has cut off incoming water sources of the lakes from Shivangaon.  “A compound wall has also been constructed around Telhara lake which is proving detrimental to birds.  The water of these lakes will be in great demand for industries and that will be the last straw,” says Thosar. 
Pushkar Kulkarni, an engineering student, echoes the same feeling.  “I started birdwatching as a child with my father Sanjay, who was a regular visitor to the area.  He took me to Telhara and Dahegaon lakes,” he said. 
Kulkarni recalls Dahegaon was popular for water birds, especially migratory Red-Crested Pochards and Comb Ducks, which were seen in over 600. 
“This year only 80-100 are seen.  Yet, as number of bird watchers have gone up frequency of visiting this place has increased resulting in discovery of more diversity and species,” informs Kulkarni. 
If you ask well-known bird expert Dr Anil Pimlapure, a dentist by profession, why birds preferred Mihan, he says Mihan is connected with three ecosystems.  There are lakes, grasslands and scrubland.  “Hence you can sight variety of birds in Mihan.  Even though development is taking place, number of transport vehicles and residential area is not so alarming to keep birds away,” says Dr Pimlapure. 
“I started birding from Telhara and Dahegaon lakes in 1984 and used to visit the place in morning and evening.  The bird count has definitely gone down but still there is bird life,” he adds. 
Dr Pimlapure informs birds too have a line of control (LOC).  In Mihan, loss of bird species in scrub, forest and agriculture areas due to industries and human settlements will be taken over by urban biodiversity species like mainas, babblers, bulbuls, doves, robins, pied starlings.  “Even today, while birding in Mihan one can sight at least 100 bird species,” says Dr Pimlapure. 
Kulkarni admits that Telhara lake is surrounded by scrubland and it was famous for larks and pipits.  Early morning or late evening is the best time to watch them but nowadays their number is decreasing.  Last year this place hosted Mongolian bar-headed geese but this year they have moved elsewhere. 
“Now a wall surrounds the lake and a big building construction is going on here.  In spite of all this we can still enjoy birding in Mihan which we birders popularly call as LRK (Lesser Rann of Kutch) of Nagpur.  It is full of surprises,” informs Kulkarni. 
Dr Pimlapure feels if the two water bodies are kept intact, hopes for bird life are still alive.  “At one time Ambazari was the most visited spot by birds and birders.  Today, due to rampant fishing, there is 80% drop in number of birds that used to visit the lake.  Dahegaon and Telhara should not meet the same fate in the name of development,” he warns. 
Avid bird watcher Indraneel Dani too has a similar story to tell.  “In the advent of Mihan, the count of birds has gone down if not number of species.  You are still lucky to sight multiple species like bristled grass bird and imperial eagle.  Last year, rare European bee eater was sighted.  It was perhaps first record in Central India,” Dani informs. 
However, now both Telhara and Dahegaon lakes are shrinking due to encroachments.  Weeds have come up and there is a need for lake management.  It is high time authorities think of sustainable development because birds are symbols of healthy ecosystems.

Howls of excitement over Mihan wolf sighting  Nagpur: The scrubland around Mihanon the city outskirts, which is a hot spot for birds, has sprung another surprise with the sighting of a full-grown wolf by city two bird watchers — Surendra Agnihotri and Nitin Marathe.  In April, city birdwatcher Sanjay Nafdey had sighted lesser florican, the smaller bird among the endangered bustard species.  Both, wolves and florican are listed under Schedule I of Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and have highest level of protection, yet continue to be ignored.  “Nagpur has got a unique distinction of being close to number of sanctuaries and national parks.  We boast of being in the vicinity of tigers and leopards, but sighting of interesting species like ‘Indian wolf’ is not reported much even though these animals are no less majestic, important and interesting.  This may be perhaps for the first time a wolf has been sighted in Mihan area,” said Agnihotri, a well-known birdwatcher from city.  He was accompanied by another birdwatcher Nitin Marathe on a routine bird watching trip to Mihan.  Agnihotri & Marathe, who work as superintendents with Central Excise, sighted the wolf on Sunday (September 6) morning in the scrubland near twin water tanks at the end of northern side of Mihan.  “We noticed sudden commotion of red-wattled lapwings in the field near them.  The birds were abnormally noisy and were actually mobbing a lone wolf that was treading cautiously in the scrubland in its typical and unmistakable style.  It was sort of a shock to see wolf’s presence in Mihan,” said Agnihotri Marathe said, “The wolf perhaps noticed our presence and was watchful.  We curiously watched this majestic animal from a distance till it moved about 400 metres towards eastern side of Mihan and then vanished into bushes but not before giving enough time to click photographs. ” A delighted Agnihotri says sighting of a healthy individual wolf at Mihan, close to the city, is certainly a good sign.  “There may be more individuals including females.  It only indicates that Mihan, which is fast going to industries, still has good flora and fauna,” he added. Interestingly, Agnihotri had earlier reported similar sighting of a pair of Indian wolf on the shores of Khapri Lake near Champa village on Nagpur-Umrer Road in May 2014.  “There are established and well-known packs of wolves near scrubby areas of Paradgaon on Umred Road, and Bor and Degma near Hingna albeit their numbers are dwindling. Agnihotri says there is presence of other wildlife species in Mihan.  These include wild boars, hare, nilgais, black bucks, and wildcats.  Other species include snakes, lizards, flapshell turtles, monitor lizards besides a variety of birds including residents and migratory. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Migratory birds herald winter  Nagpur: With the onset of winter, the first flocks of transient and migratory birds have started arriving in different parts of the region.  More species of water and forest migratory birds are expected to come along by the month end.  At Telhara Lake in Mihan, a Greylag Goose was sighted by Rohit Charpe.  Believed to be quite a rare sighting by local bird experts, the bird is usually found in Iceland, Finland, Baltic Coasts, Western Russia and others during its breeding season. Water bodies in Amravati which are regular hosts to migratory birds have started witnessing arrival of many species like Pacific Golden Plover, Black-Bellied Tern, Northern Pintail, Lesser Whistling Duck, Black Redstart, Black-Tailed Godvit, Verditer Flycatcher and Northern Shoveler.  Avid birdwatcher and founder of Disha Foundation Yadav Tarte said, “Both water as well as forest birds are being sighted here in good numbers.  Some birds have come for migration while some are just taking a halt.  It has been more than 15 days since a Pacific Golden Plover is being sighted every day at a water body here,” he said.  Tarte added that other migratory birds like Bar-Headed Goose, Common Crane and Black Stork are expected to come at Daryapur and other 24 water bodies in and around Amravati.  “Sightings of these birds have been recorded in Northern India and they are expected to reach Central India within a week,” he said.  This winter, Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district has witnessed some variations in the arrival of migratory birds, said wildlife researcher and avid birdwatcher Ramzan Virani.  “Ruddy Shelducks are usually the ones to arrive here first and in good numbers but this time they landed late and only a few are being sighted.  Surprisingly, Comb Ducks have arrived early along with Northern Pintail and Northern Shoveler.  We are expecting Common and Red-Crested Pochards,” said Virani. Northern Pintails, Lesser Whistling Ducks and Pallid Harrierswere sighted by avid birdwatchers Nitin Marathe and Avinash Londhe at Khapri Lake on Umred Road.  “This must be the first flock of the migratory birds, indicating that the winter migration has begun,” said Londhe.  Honorary wildlife warden of Akola, Devendra Telkar, said that the region has fewer migratory birds this time.  “Some River Terns and Open-Billed Storks have been sighted but till now, not many birds have come when compared to the previous years.  De-silting of lakes can be a reason,” he said.  BIRDS OF DIFFERENT FEATHERS Birds landed: Pacific Golden Plover, Black-Bellied Tern, Northern Pintail, Lesser Whistling Duck, Common Pochard, Black Redstart, Black-tailed Godwit, Verditer Flycatcher, Northern Shoveler, Ruddy Shelducks and Comb Ducks.  These are both water and forest birds which come to India for the purpose of breeding or in search of food.  Birds expected: Bar-Headed Goose, Common crane, Black stork, Common Pochard, Red-Crested Pochards are expected to arrive in a month’s time.  Usual spots of bird watching, where and distance from Nagpur Chatri and Wadali Lakes, Amravati (155km); Kekatpur and Dastapur Lake, Amravati (130km); Pohra Malkhed forest, Amravati (150km); Kumbhari, Kapsi and other water bodies in Akola 250km; Khapri, Paradgaon and Haladgaon lakes, Umred Road (35km); Navegaon Lake, Gondia (130km); Mihan water bodies (just outside city)Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Little egret with grey morph, bar-headed geese sighted  Nagpur: In a unique finding, a little egret with grey morph was sighted in the region.  Bird experts said that the morph is very rarely reported in Asia Pacific and might be a result of mutation, cross breeding or pigmentation.  The egret was recently sighted by Jayant Wadatkar, honorary wildlife warden, Amravati district and birdwatcher Neenad Abhang at upper Wardha dam near Morshi.  Though the bird was earlier confused with other species of egrets like western reef, it was finally identified as grey morph little egret.  The genesis of the morph remains indeterminate as not much research has been done it.  But bird experts were of the view that multiple factors can cause the change in colour.  “It can either be due to mutation or crossbreeding.  Another probable reason can be pigmentation, albinism which is seen in some birds,” said senior bird expert Dr Anil Pimplapure.  He added that rest of the bird’s features like black legs, yellow feet and black beak resemble with little egrets.  Pimplapure stressed that further study and continuous monitoring of the bird is required.  Wadatkar, who is keeping a regular watch on the bird’s behaviour said that it always stays with the flock of little egrets and displays same behavioural patterns.  Meanwhile, ending the keen wait of local birdwatchers, the first flock of 150-200 bar-headed geese has arrived in the region at Wadgaon lake in Umred.  According to bird watchers and experts, this is the first time that bar-headed geese have chosen this lake, probably due to changes in habitat.  The flock was sighted at Wadgaon lake by avid bird watcher Avinash Londhe who pointed out there have been no sightings of these Mongolian birds at their usual local hotspots, Paradgaon and Sayaki lakes.  “Last year, the birds had first arrived at Khapri Lake.  Crop rotation and habitat threat can be the reasons behind change in choice of water bodies,” he said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Chunar Fort," Times Passion Trail: Lessons in history, along the Ganga  Times Passion Trail takes you back to the origins of the holy river that flows through the heart of India.  Ganga aaye kahaan se, Ganga jaye kahaan re?""  Hemant Kumar asks in an evocative song from the film Kabuliwala, voicing what millions of Indians have mused silently for generations.  There are other rivers, longer and mightier elsewhere in the world; some like Amazon, Nile, Euphrates, Tigris and Indus have spawned impressive civilizations, but none can match the magic spell cast by the Ganga.  The third Times Passion Trail of season 2, Along the Ganges, is set to take you on a spiritual journey that traces the course of this mighty river from Devprayag to Rishikesh, Haridwar, Allahabad and Varanasi.  Ganga is born at Devprayag, where Bhagirathi originating in Gomukh beyond Gangotri meets Alaknanda that starts as a trickle at Vasudhara, a slender waterfall near Badrinath.  On day one in Devprayag, participants will visit the ghat for a holy bath and take part in Ganga Arti.  Devout Hindus believe that all sins accumulated in a lifetime are washed away by taking a dip in the sacred river.  This will be followed by a visit to the Raghunath temple, which will host a session on Ganga strotam, and a narration of the Ganga story by Prof K K Muhammed.  Pushpesh Pant, noted historian and food critic who will lead the trail, says a rock-cut sculpture in Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, dating back to the Pallava period (circa 4-5 century CE) purportedly describes the scene when this life-sustaining stream descended on Earth.  Not very far away lie the ruins of Gangaikondacholapuram, the capital city founded by a legendary Chola emperor.  The caravan then heads to Rishikesh, where the famous Laxman Jhulla and lively markets await.  An early morning yoga & meditation session by Acharya Manish on the banks of the Ganga is sure to uplift spirits.  Participants also get to see some famous sites like Bharat Temple & Veer Bhadra Temple, and attend the Aarti ceremony at Parmarth Niketan before heading to Rishikesh, where spirituality meets architectural marvel on sites such as Daksh Prajapati Temple, Bilwakeshwar Mahadev Temple and Mayadevi Temple.  An informative session on Ayurveda and an organic lunch with Swami Balakrishna is on the menu here.  The most picturesque part of the trip lies in Allahabad, where a boat ride at the Triveni Sangam and a regal lunch at the Chunar Fort will serve as a treat for the senses.  Next stop is Varanasi, where a visit to the majestic Kashi Vishwanath Temple and witnessing the famous Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat from a boat promise to be a memorable end to a unique tour.  The trail also has fun sessions on Sanskrit and vedic maths and a visit to Banaras Hindu University.  Ganga has become a part of our culture and is encountered everywhere - in classical literature, folksongs, and sculptures.  Kalidasa has painted fascinating word pictures of the river, personifying it in Raghuvamsha and Kumarsambhava.  Adi Shankaracharya walked to take samadhi in the snow-clad Himalayas but not before he had composed the moving Gangalahari stotra.  The river, likened to the mother who nurtures, was invoked in anguish by Bhupen Hazarika as he composed the lyrics, "" Vistaar hai apaar, charon oar hahakar, Ganga tu behati hai kyun?""  To embark on the Ganga trail is the beginning of an eternal journey - exhilarating and rejuvenating.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.  Sucharita Gupta:  Ganga trail gets a musical touch in Varanasi  A delightful musical evening was a befitting culmination of Ganga Trail, organised as part of Times Passion Trails, an initiative by The Times of India.  The trail, that started from Devprayag and moved to Rishikesh, Haridwar and Allahabad, concluded at Varanasi and was a soul-stirring experience for the participants, who hailed from different cities. 
In Banaras, the travellers visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple, participated in the Ganga Arti and attended a lecture on Vedic Philosophy at Banaras Hindu University.  Treated to some soulful Kabir songs at Kabir Math, the participants also enjoyed a picnic in the midst of River Ganga at the Chunar Fort. 
The presence of eminent scholar Prof Pushpesh Pant, who gave some valuable inputs to the participants, added to their experience.  âTravelling along River Ganga is always a novel experience.  One tends to discover something new not only about the river but also about oneself,â he said . 
Gushing about her experience, Smita Visheshwar from Chennai said, âBanaras turned out to be as I had imagined â picturesque and beautiful. â
Dinesh Pai, a banker from Dubai, who participated in the trail, said âWe have travelled 900 kms along River Ganga witnessing different cultures which was quite a memorable experience.  What makes Banaras special is the vibrancy of the cityâ.  At the evening depicting the musical traditions of Banaras, which was held for the participants, eminent vocalist Sucharita Gupta regaled the audience with mellifluous thumri, chaiti and Holi compositions.  She also rendered some popular numbers like Nazar Lagi Raja Tore Bangle Par, Hamri Atariya Pe.  Dama Dam Mast Kalandar led to impromptu dancing by Asha Senani, Romy Agarwal and Jenice Somji. 
On popular demand Dhanush Acharya, a participant from Dubai, crooned some numbers like Phoolon Ke Rang Se, and Pal Pal Dil Ke Pas.  Others also joined in when he sang Kal Ho Na Ho.

Chunar Fort to be restored, opened for public  LUCKNOW: The historic Chunar fort in Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh will soon open its gates for tourists.  On Tuesday, UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav directed that the PAC recruitment training centre running inside the fort will be vacated and said it will be revived as a heritage structure in UP. 
“The Chunar fort will remain alive.  The chief secretary will ensure funds for the heritage building,” said Akhilesh.  He was addressing international and Indian travel writers and bloggers at the Uttar Pradesh Tourism's Travel Writers' Conclave 2015. 
The fort whose history dates back to 56 BC, is currently occupied by one of the PAC recruitment training centres and is situated on the rocky banks of Ganga. 
“Those who talk about trillion dollar businesses, should talk about tourism.  They should at least retain their tradition and culture like the way we have held onto Lucknow's etiquette.  Tourism is connected to all aspects of society and people and is all inclusive,” he said. 
“We don't term UP as the state that has given the country seven PMs.  For us, those who aim to be the PM, can come to UP, be it Varanasi or other places,” said the CM. 
“A lot of people have prospered in this state that has had a rich heritage of communal harmony.  There is no discord or difference between people here, as is being claimed by some,” he added further. 
Talking over the tourism prospects of UP, Akhilesh said that the Golden Triangle (tourist circuit linking Delhi, Agra and Jaipur) will soon be trailing UP's Heritage Arc (linking Agra, Lucknow and Varanasi). 
Yadav also appreciated the talent of guides who entwine history into fiction smoothly “The guides tell you about stories such as when Tansen used to sing, lamps would be lit up.  Those who are away from science will not believe this, but science has proved that at a certain frequency of music, light can be produced,” he said. 
Chief secretary Alok Ranjan pointing out to the attempt of unleashing UP's potential to the world said, “The extent of misinformation is such that many foreign tourists believe that Taj Mahal is in Rajasthan.  We need to properly inform people around the world about our tourism assets. ” In this regard, he said that the UP government is expanding Agra to build a Mughal museum along with other projects.

Those travelling to New Delhi railway station can use Connaught Place to reach the Ajmeri Gate side if travelling from south Delhi.  North Delhi commuters can use Jhandewalan while west Delhi commuters should use the ISBT bridge and approach the station from the Paharganj side.

FIR on fake EWS admission racket in top Delhi schools  NEW DELHI: Delhi Policeâs crime branch has detected fake nursery admissions under the economically weaker section (EWS) category in leading city schools, according to sources.  An FIR (number 41) has been registered in the case, the sources said. 
An organized syndicate is believed to be involved in the racket.  The kingpin is at large. 
The police has already detected more than 30 such admissions in the last two years and suspect the number may go up substantially, the sources added. 
âThe schools where fake admissions have been detected are Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School (Humayun Road), DPS Vasant Kunj, DPS Rohini, DPS RK Puram, G D Goenka, Lancer Convent Rohini, Venkateshwara school, Dwarka, Ryan international school, Rohini and several others,â a source told TOI. 
When contacted, joint commissioner Ravindra Yadav confirmed that fake admission had been detected in these schools.  The crooks charged anything between Rs 1 lakh and 5 lakh per admission depending on the school and the income of the parents. 
Notices have been served to more than a dozen schools wherein police has sought the list of students admitted under the EWS quota and the documents furnished by them, police said. 
âWe have registered an FIR under appropriate IPC sections and served notices to more than a dozen schools, the details of which can not be shared at this stage.  Our probe is at a preliminary stage,â Yadav added.  Two of the crooks have been identified but the cops did not confirm if they had been arrested. 
The police swung into action after receiving a tip-off about a syndicate facilitating nursery admissions.  The cops served a notice to the schools about which they were tipped off and got admission documents.  Verification of the documents led the cops to identify the students and parents.  Interrogation of the parents revealed the names of people who were a part of the gang. 
A circular by the Directorate of Education confirms that Delhi Police has detected fake admissions in Delhi schools. 
âOne of the district magistrates of revenue department, has brought to the notice of this directorate that a few admissions under EWS category in various schools of Delhi have been got done on the basis of forged and fake income certificates submitted by the respective parents.  It has also been informed that due diligence is not being exercised and verification of income certificates and caste certificates is not being done by the principals/managements of the schools at the time of admission.  As a result, ineligible people are getting undue benefits and eligible/deserving students are deprived of admission under the above said categories,â the circular reads. 
âThe directorate has taken the said irregularities seriously.  Therefore, all the principals/managements of Private Unaided Recognized Schools of Delhi are hereby directed to be cautious in this regard and exercise due diligence as well as carry out necessary verification before admissions so as to ensure that benefits of admission under EWS/DG Category students reach the eligible and deserving students,â the circular further reads. 
However, Bindu Sehgal, principal of DPS Vasant Kunj, said, âWe have not received any notice from either the Crime Branch or the Directorate of Education.  Ours is a most transparent system and the draw of lots for EWS seats is done in the present of members of the parent-teacher association (PTA) and the DoE's nominee.  Sometimes we have done home-visits too to check if the candidate genuinely belongs to this category but have not detected any fakes so far. â
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 makes it mandatory for all private unaided recognized schools to admit at least 25% children belonging to economically weaker sections and the disadvantaged group category to entry level classes and provide free and compulsory education to them till completion of elementary education. 
Further, private unaided recognized schools (non-minority) running on land allotted by government agencies are also under obligation to admit 20% children belonging to EWS Category in upper classes.  The income and caste certificates issued by the competent authority of revenue department, GNCT of Delhi are fundamental and decisive documents to claim the benefits under EWS/DG Category.

Phones off, Delhi couple who ran racket dodge police again  NEW DELHI: More than 30 policemen in six teams are raiding places in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan to catch two people suspected to have operated the nursery admission racket in top Delhi schools. 
Sources said the gang ran separate operations in north and south Delhi.  The one in Rohini and other north Delhi areas was headed by a man named Prince.  His wife, Punita, was also involved and three of their associates have been identified. 
A source in one of the raiding teams said the couple's phones were traceable in Haryana till Friday night but had been switched off since Saturday morning.  Police are trying to track down the people they were in touch with before going underground. 
Prince and Punita were educational consultants in the Rohini area and are suspected to be involved in admission rackets at the college level also.  They have managed to throw police off their trail at least thrice in the past one month and change phone numbers frequently. 
Police are scanning call details of the couple to ascertain whether they were in touch with school officials and are likely to seek lists of school officials' phone numbers. 
"" Fake admissions have been detected at Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School (Humayun Road), DPS Vasant Kunj, DPS Rohini, DPS RK Puram, GD Goenka, Lancer Convent Rohini, Venkateshwara School, Dwarka, Ryan International School, Rohini and several others,""  a senior officer told TOI. 
TOI had reported on Saturday that an FIR had been registered in this connection.  The number of cases is expected to increase beyond the 30 detected so far.  Notices have been served on more than 12 schools to provide lists of students admitted under EWS quota and the documents furnished by their parents. 
The FIR in the case states that EWS seats are sold on the basis of fake income and residence proofs.  In some cases, children are admitted under a false name which is changed later.  "" This illegal practice defeats the very purpose of the scheme launched for economically weaker section of society,""  it states.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Cops smell rat in move from EWS to general seat  NEW DELHI: The crime branch, which is probing fake nursery admissions, has asked schools to submit the list of students who were admitted under the EWS quota but later applied for a change to general category.  Police have information that a large number of students had changed their quota to get out of the ambit of probe, if one took place. 
Police interrogated a dozen parents who expressed ignorance and told that they were informed that the admission was happening in a lawful manner.  However, they could not answer why their children were admitted under fake names. 
Joint commissioner (crime), Ravindra Yadav refused to comment saying the operation was ongoing and details would be confirmed after arrests were made.  He has reportedly pulled up the probe team for investigating at a snail’s pace. 
The probe team is contemplating to avail services of data analysis experts to detect anomalies or contradictions in the information furnished by schools.  Sources said the list of students who opted for change in quota after admissions has given crucial leads. 
An officer said that the kingpins of the north Delhi module, identified as Prince and Puneeta, had connived with some school officials and got the students’ quota changed.  The parents submitted an application to the school stating that their income had increased and they were no longer in the ambit of economically weaker section and, thus, their ward may be treated as general category student.  The school accepted the application and began charging fees. 
“Fake admissions have been detected at Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School (Humayun Road), DPS Vasant Kunj, DPS Rohini, DPS RK Puram, GD Goenka, Lancer Convent Rohini, Venkateshwara School, Dwarka, Ryan International School Rohini, and several others,” a senior officer told TOI.  An FIR has been registered and the number of cases is expected to increase beyond the 30 detected so far. 
Prince and Punita, educational consultants in Rohini area, have managed to throw police off their trail at least thrice in the last one month and change phone numbers frequently.  The couple’s phones were traceable in Haryana till last week, but are switched off since Saturday.

Delhi cops unearth 300 fake nursery admissions  NEW DELHI: Police have unearthed more than 300 fake nursery admissions through the quota for poor students in top Delhi schools and arrested four people in the racket. 
The principal of Bal Bharti School, Pitampura, has been examined and her office raided on Tuesday, as cops said school authorities could be involved and claimed that some schools took "" unusually long""  to furnish admission data.  TOI was the first to report the scam, concerning admissions to the 2014-15 batch.  READ ALSO: FIR on fake EWS admission racket in top Delhi schools Police said the admission racket was highly organized.  The agents managed admissions in fictitious names under the economically weaker sections (EWS) quota and later got the names and quota changed in school records with the help of officials. 
"" The schools where fake admissions have been detected are Delhi Public School (Rohini, Vasant Kunj, RK Puram and Mathura Road), Modern School (Humayun Road), Lancer Convent, Ryan International School, Montfort School (Ashok Vihar), G D Goenka (Rohini), Vikas Bharti (Rohini), Bal Bharti School (Pitampura) and Heritage School (Rohini).  Verification of the EWS certificates used for admissions in many other schools is still under process,""  joint commissioner of police (crime) Ravindra Yadav said. 
Those arrested have been identified as Anil Kumar, Sudama Singh, Sharam Singh and Mukesh Sharma, the kingpin of this module.  While Anil sent admission seekers to Mukesh, Sudama arranged the forged documents.  Dharam prepared and finalized the fake papers, police said.  READ ALSO: Schools say no way to verify, not in wrong "" The gang charged Rs 3-10 lakh for each admission in prominent schools of Delhi, in collusion with the school administration,""  Yadav added. 
Cops started investigating the racket a few months ago after receiving information about certain irregular admissions. 
"" A special team led by ACP K P S Malhotra was formed to develop this information and the database of students admitted under the EWS quota was obtained from the schools in question.  The EWS certificates, on the basis of which admissions were sought, were also verified from SDM offices and several of them were found to be forged,""  additional commissioner (crime) Ashok Chand said. 
It was also found that multiple admissions had taken place in different schools on the basis of the same certificates and names of the students later changed.  A case under the appropriate sections of the law was registered at the crime branch.  READ ALSO: Principal kept in touch with main accused During investigations, some of the parents revealed that several modules of touts were active across the city to facilitate fake admissions. 
"" During the process of data collection from school authorities and verification of EWS certificates from the concerned SDM offices, who too took very long to respond, these touts were alerted and went underground,""  Chand said.  Minute scrutiny by the crime branch team yielded results, when a specific information was received regarding one agent, Anil Kumar.  READ ASLO: Future of 250 children hangs in the balance "" Immediately, the team swung into action and a trap was laid near Budh Vihar.  Anil was apprehended by a team comprising inspector Kulbir Singh, SIs Ritesh and Neeraj among others.  From him, documents of parents who had got their children admitted in Bal Bharti School, Pitampura, were recovered,""  Chand said. 
Subsequenlty the other three were also arrested.  Documents, computers, printers, rubber stamps of various government officials and software used for making fake documents were recovered from them. 
The mastermind of the module, Mukesh Sharma, has disclosed that he had a masters in zoology and gave home tuitions.  While being involved in the admission process of someone known to him, he learned about the EWS quota in schools.  He then developed contacts in the school's administration and set up the racket, police said.

Schools say no way to verify, not in wrong  NEW DELHI: School authorities are denying that they were involved in running the fake EWS admission racket.  They also reiterate that till mid-May this year when a circular with a web address was issued, they had no way of checking whether the certificates submitted were genuine.  A principal says she’d informed the district authority of possible violations, but no action was taken. 
“I can say with confidence that no one was involved,” states Manju Rajput, head of Raghubir Singh Jurnior Modern School on Humayun Road which has been mentioned by police.  “Before May, there was no mechanism to check,” she continues.  “I have sent teams to check out doubtful cases.  In one instance, there were several candidates with the same address.  I let applicants know that the school is authorized to cancel admissions and the draws are conducted openly in the presence of officials and recorded on video.  But it is simply not possible to verify.  This is a good opportunity for police to track down where these certificates are coming from instead of imagining that the management is involved. ”
“It is wrong to accuse the schools.  How can we be involved when they’ve got the fake certificates through people outside the school?” asks S Premlatha, principal, Vikas Bharati Public School—also on the list.  She adds that the nine fake admissions discovered at her school were cancelled and new students have been admitted against those vacancies already. 
Neena Kaul, principal, Heritage School, Rohini, says that the school “has from time to time informed the SDM of possible violations in EWS admissions but there was no response”.  She, too, says of her school that it’s not in any way involved. 
“We have followed every date list, every instruction.  Why was the website link circulated only last month and not two years ago? We would’ve done the needful like we always do. ”
Lawyer and activist Khagesh Jha believes that a particular provision in the Right to Education Act 2009—that made 25% quota for equally weaker sections and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) compulsory—is being exploited.  It requires schools to admit EWS students first from within a radius of one kilometre and, if there are still vacancies, from within three kilometers and finally six.  “Practically all the schools being named are located in places where they won’t have significant slum clusters within one kilometre.  We need to see if these certificates have addresses within a kilometre of the school.  If there are few applicants, there may not even be a draw and admission is practically assured; even if there is a draw, your chances are better,” he explains.  Modern’s main draw, for instance, is from Nizamuddin Basti which is within three kilometres but not one.  Heritage has no slum area close by at all but attracts students from villages and usually has enough applicants within a kilometre to merit a draw.

NEW DELHI: The high court's remark that Khan Market traders should pool in resources to redevelop the market as it is private property has cheered New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) that is opposed to spending money on the much-delayed redevelopment project. 
While traders say the civic agency has gone back on its word, officials say NDMC never promised to redevelop the market but merely helped its two associations finalize a fire safety plan.  ""  We got a comprehensive redevelopment plan made for the market, but it was never approved by any statutory body.  As for fire safety, NDMC facilitated the process of preparing a fire safety plan.  But we (government agency) can't implement the project and spend money on it, as it is private property.  Owners of these private properties have to pay for the implementation of the fire safety plan,""  said Nikhil Kumar, NDMC secretary, adding that the civic agency will abide by the court order in the matter. 
Khan Market Welfare Association (KMWA) had moved court seeking directions to NDMC for implementing the redevelopment plan.  ""  How can they (NDMC) say they can' t spend money on private property? They have collected a huge amount from first-floor traders as conversion charges.  We pay extremely high property taxes,""  said Arjun Kapur, president of KMWA.  ""  The civic agency had roped in an expert to prepare the redevelopment plan.  Now how can they say that traders will have to pay for it? The amount deposited as conversion charges was meant for the market' s redevelopment. "" 
Sources say none of the first-floor shops has a no-objection certificate from Delhi Fire Service.  Fire safety is a major concern as the market is not equipped to handle a blaze.  A Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee had also highlighted the issue of fire safety and had raised objections on the sub-division of shops in 2011.  Thereafter, the Union urban development ministry had directed NDMC to prepare a redevelopment plan. 
""  I was commissioned to prepare the redevelopment plan.  Based on that plan, NDMC got land for creating a parking facility and Amrita Shergill Marg was extended till Humayun Road.  Many more actions were also taken.  But the plan is yet to see the light of day,""  said Sudhir Vohra, urban planner and consultant architect for the project. 
In 2013, the civic agency and the two stakeholders—KMWA and Khan Market Traders' Association (KMTA)—had finalized the redevelopment plan.  The civic agency had also roped in IIT-Roorkee to study the structural stability of buildings.  In January 2014, Delhi Fire Service approved the plan to implement its fire safety plan.  But the civic agency didn' t implement it as the two traders associations could not come to an agreement.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Delhi HC questions NDMC on renaming Aurangzeb Road  NEW DELHI: The row over renaming Aurangzeb Road in honour of former President A P J Abdul Kalam reached the Delhi high court on Friday which sought to know procedures followed by NDMC while taking the decision. 
A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath refused to stay the move or even issue notice on a petition challenging the name change.  However, it asked New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) to give the reasons on which it decided to change the name of the road.  “We need information on what basis you (NDMC) decided to change the name.  File an affidavit before September 22,” the bench said, while hearing a PIL seeking to restrain NDMC from issuing a notification regarding changing of the name. 
Filed by a lawyer, Shahid Ali, the petition claimed the decision “lacks understanding of history” and is against a 1975 notification, according to which names that are a part of history will not be altered.  The issue of the notification was also raised by AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan who wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, asking for a cancellation of the order. 
Defending the civic agency’s stand, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain told the court that the road has been renamed after a “contemporaneous public icon who the country worships”. 
The senior law officer also dismissed the claim by the petitioner that norms were violated saying “this road comes under the domain of NDMC, giving unfettered power to the civic body to rename the road.  It is not the first time that any road has been renamed… the name of Humayun Road was also changed”. 
According to the PIL, NDMC’s move to change a historical name was bound to “adversely affect the image of India as a secular and justice-imparting country”.  The plea said the “act of altering the historical name is nothing but an outcome of sick and communal politics”. 
On August 28, the request to change the name of the road, made by BJP MPs Maheish Girri and Meenakshi Lekhi, and AAP’s trade wing secretary, was accepted by NDMC.

School admission racket busted Four men were arrested for their alleged involvement in an organised racket that specialised in giving admissions in prominent city schools at exorbitant prices, the Crime Branch said on Tuesday. 
Ravindra Yadav, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), said as many as 250 admissions across Delhi schools, which were obtained on the basis of fake economically weaker section (EWS) certificates among other forged documents and priced between Rs.  3 and Rs.  10 lakh, had come to light so far. 
While many such modules were found to be active in Delhi, according to Mr.  Yadav, a home tutor, who was the brains behind one such racket, and three of his agents, identified as Anil Kumar, Sudama Singh and Dharam Singh, were arrested. 
“Mukesh Sharma, who holds a M. Sc.  degree in zoology and used to give home tuitions, decided to exploit the EWS quota to his advantage.  He developed contacts within a particular school’s administration, procured fake EWS certificates in addition to voter Ids, and charged between Rs.  3 and Rs.  5 lakh per admission depending on the profile of the family,” Mr.  Yadav said. 
The Crime Branch claimed schools where fake EWS certificates were found to have been used to procure admissions included the Delhi Public School’s Rohini, Vasant Kunj, RK Puram and Mathura Road branches, Modern School on Humayun Road, Lancer’s Convent, Ryan International School, Montfort School, Ashok Vihar, GD Goenka School, Rohini, Vikas Bharti School, Rohini, Bal Bharti School, Pitampura, and Heritage School, Rohini, among others.  Mr.  Yadav said information about the racket was received a few months ago. 
“The verification process revealed that many of the EWS certificates used were fake and forged.  Multiple admissions apparently took place in different schools on the basis of the same certificates with the names of the students getting changed later,” said Mr.  Yadav. 
According to Mr.  Yadav, Anil was the first to be arrested followed by Sudama, Dharam and finally Mukesh. 
The verification of EWS certificates used for admissions in many other schools is still under process. 
Mr.  Yadav said further investigation on the possible connivance of members of the school administration was being probed.

Moulivakkam,"Buyers prefer apartments over plots  TRICHY: The skyrocketing prices of land and individual houses in the city are prompting people here to go for aprtments.  The apartment promoters in the city are pinning their hopes on people from the middle-class sections who are looking to get a residence with the aid of housing loans offered by many banks.  Though apartments started cropping up in the city nearly 20 years ago, the trend of opting for such residences has only gradually picked up.  Despite the sluggishness in the real estate and construction fields for the past few years, apartment promoters are ready to take up new projects.  As many as 120 apartments are under construction in the city alone.  Apartments have mushroomed against a backdrop of skyrocketing costs of unapproved empty plots, making it impossible for most people to acquire an individual house of their own.  Besides, it is learnt that majority of the plot promoters do not even approach the local planning authority (LPA) because they are not ready to satisfy norms like broad roads.  To boost the demand for apartments, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (CREDAI) conducted a three-day 'Fairpro- 2015', an exhibition to attract people dreaming of owning a house.  The apartment promoters are focusing on developing flats within city limits, rather than constructing individual houses.  The price of apartments on the main roads in the city is higher than in the inner roads.  "" Though many dream of owning an individual house in the city limit, these are not affordable.  So they switch to buying apartments which are available at reasonable prices.  This will give apartment promoters a boost,""  said V Gopinathan, co-chairman of Fairpro-2015.  There is a general perception among people that the price of apartments will not appreciate like individual houses.  However, N Anand, chairman of Fairpro, said that the resale value of apartments inside the city limit will be good.  "" It is a wrong perception that apartment prices will not appreciate.  People can sell flats for marginally good prices and they will not face any loss,""  said Anand.  The promoters offer one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom flats, which may cost anywhere from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore, depending on the area.  The collapse of a building in Moulivakkam in Chennai last year has created apprehension among some potential customers about the safety of multi-storey buildings.  However, promoters assured that safety was their prime concern in all their projects.  The promoters are predicting an increase in the price of flats in the next three month due to price hike in all construction materials, particularly cement.

Court blocks demolition of second bldg in Moulivakkam  CHENNAI: More than six months after one of the two 11-storied residential towers collapsed at Moulivakkam, killing 61 people, the Madras high court has quashed the Kancheepuram district collector’s order to raze the second building still standing at the site.  The first bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M M Sundresh gave the relief after it was revealed that the district administration passed the demolition order without giving an opportunity of hearing to the builder and furnishing details of materials relied on by officials to pass the order. 
The bench, passing the orders on a petition filed by the building’s promoter M Bala Gurusamy, who is the managing director of Prime Sristi Housing Private Ltd, said: “It is trite law to say that the material relied upon against the builder ought to have been handed over to him to facilitate him to take his defence.  This has not been done. ”
After P Wilson, senior counsel for DMK leader M K Stalin, argued that the authorities were trying to protect the surviving second building, the bench directed the collector to furnish relevant materials to both the builder and the association of flat purchasers, so that the latter could prepare their independent claims against the builder to whom they paid money.  The bench then adjourned matter to March 17 for further proceedings. 
During arguments, Wilson reiterated Stalin’s demand for a CBI probe into the issue.  To this, the bench replied that the court was monitoring the investigation.

Developers’ body, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI) has welcomed the move.  CREDAI Tamil Nadu president N Nandakumar said it would help buyers take informed decisions while buying apartments. 
“It will control unauthorized developments, which have been hampering the growth of developers who stick to rules while promoting projects.  CREDAI as a body has made it clear that developers who violate building norms have no place in the organization,” he said. 
“Unhealthy price competition among builders has been a major bane for the industry.  Those who violate approved plans and construct additional space sell their apartments at prices much lower than what developers who comply with norms charge,” said Nandakumar.  Many customers end up buying from errant developers, unaware of the violations in construction. 
An insurance consultant, who booked an apartment from a developer in the city a few years ago, had a tough time raising a loan to register the apartment.  He said, “Only when I applied for a loan did I realize that my entire penthouse was a deviation from the CMDA approved plan.  I was primarily attracted by the high undivided share of land the builder offered me.  It was obviously a trap. ”
CREDAI Chennai president Ajit Kumar Chordia said publicizing building violations would help speed up the legal due diligence process.  But it would be a difficult task to post all past data on the website of the regulatory body, he said. 
Another concern is whether CMDA would be able to provide timely information to apartment buyers.  For instance, most buyers book apartments while they are under construction.  CMDA’s review of the project would be of help to such buyers only if the agency carries out periodical inspections during the course of construction. 
Many developers who have violated building norms at will in the past have gone scot-free because of the lackadaisical attitude of the regulatory agencies and the state government’s generosity in condoning such violations.

Why Moulivakkam report not tabled: HC  CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday cautioned the Tamil Nadu government that it would be constrained to hand over the probe into the June 28, 2014 building collapse at Moulivakkam to the CBI, if there is further delay in placing the one-man commission’s report on the matter before the state assembly.  The warning came from the first bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice T S Sivagnanam, a couple of days after the city marked the first anniversary of the tragedy. 
Justice R Reghupathy, who was named to probe the collapse, handed over the report to chief minister J Jayalalithaa on August 25, 2014.  Such judicial commission reports are supposed to be discussed at cabinet, and then tabled in the assembly along with cabinet decisions and recommendations.  In this case, no action has been taken after it was handed over to chief minister in a sealed cover. 
Pointing out this anomaly, DMK leader M K Stalin, who had earlier filed PILs seeking a CBI probe into the matter, moved another petition in the court on Tuesday saying relevance of the report has lapsed as it was not tabled in the assembly within the mandatory six months.  His senior counsel, former additional solicitor general of India P Wilson, said: “As per Section 3(4) of the Commission of Inquiry Act, the report should be placed before the assembly with a government note within six months from the date of receipt.  Therefore, the report given by Justice Reghupathy on August 25, 2014 has lapsed and the government is barred from placing it in the assembly. ”
Advocate general of Tamil Nadu A L Somayaji, however, denied there was any anomaly or lacuna in government’s handling of the issue, and assured the bench that he would ascertain the status of the report and the government’s decision in a couple of weeks.  The case was adjourned to July 13 for further hearing. 
During arguments, the judges repeated displeasure at the delay in filing counter-affidavits by the government. 
The June 28, 2014 collapse of the 11-storied building under construction killed 61 workers, triggering a spate of PILs, including those filed by Stalin, demanding a CBI probe, demolition of the second tower still standing close to its collapsed counterpart, removal of danger-zone tag, action against CMDA and other enforcement authorities for dereliction of duty, clearance of debris and search for remains of more victims, if any, underneath the rubble. 
A special investigation team which had filed a chargesheet in the Sriperumpudur magistrate court has now taken permission from the court to conduct further investigation, amidst charges of attempt to dilute the prosecution case itself.

TN saw most building collapses among southern states last year  CHENNAI: Real estate boom may have changed cityscapes, but the breathtaking pace at which highrises are being constructed in the country has a fatal side effect; building collapse.  The latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report says an average of four people were killed everyday in building collapses in the country in 2014.  When it comes to southern states, Tamil Nadu leads the list with 132 deaths, followed by Andhra Pradesh (93), Karnataka (49), Kerala (46) and Telangana (26). 
Last year, as many as 1,833 building collapses left 1,821 people dead and 580 injured.  Nationally, Uttar Pradesh saw the highest number of fatalities due to building collapses with 348 deaths, followed by Madhya Pradesh (184) and Maharashtra (180). 
Experts say the high incidence of building collapse in the country can be attributed to hasty construction of buildings with substandard materials, driven by high real estate demand.  Poor monitoring by government agencies is also to be blamed, experts say.  Many municipal bodies do not have adequate staff to conduct frequent inspections to monitor building violations.  There are also allegations of corruption in issuing of plan approvals. 
On June 28, 2014, an 11 storey under-construction building at Moulivakkam in Porur collapsed, killing 61 people, mostly construction workers.  However, the state government is yet to table the one-man commission's report on Moulivakkam building collapse before the Assembly. 
Union minister of state for urban development Venkaiah Naidu recently suggested that local bodies should make the town planner, inspector or whoever is in-charge of that area accountable for unauthorized constructions.  But the plan is yet to be implemented. 
A member of the Madras high court's monitoring committee for building violations, M G Devasahayam said the NCRB report on building collapses in Tamil Nadu is not surprising.  "" Political interference and corruption prevent enforcement officials from doing their duty,""  he said, adding that local level officials rarely conduct soil checks, especially on highrise buildings. 
Y Arul Das, state coordinator of Nirman Mazdoor Panchayat Sangam, a registered trade union of construction workers, said the actual number of deaths due to building collapses in the country is much higher.  For instance, more than 70 people died in building collapse in Moulivakkam and wall collapses in Tiruvallur.  "" Migrant workers often get killed at construction sites, but these accidents often go unreported as builders often settle cases with money. ""  He said most states, including TN, have failed to disburse the money collected from building cess to eligible workers. 
When contacted, a senior government official said there is a need to conduct fresh verification to check building violations.  "" People often deviate from the approved plan and construct additional floors without taking permission.  It's difficult to prevent all violations with existing staff.  With the current strength we can identify only 20% of violations. ""  Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.  HC stays order marking danger zone at crash site  CHENNAI: A Kancheepuram collector’s order declaring a 50m radius of the 11-storied building that collapsed in Moulivakkam a danger zone was stayed by the Madras high court on Monday. 
The order does not refer to any provisions of law empowering the district collector to declare the area around the collapse site as danger zone, and people adversely affected by the declaration were not put on notice, said Justice M Sathyanaryanan, staying operation of the July 1 order of Kancheepuram collector K Baskaran. 
However, taking note of the condition of the second 11-storied building which is still standing 10m away from the collapse site, the judge said: “It is made clear that in the event of collapse of the adjacent multi-storied building, the petitioner has to take the risk and bear the consequences. ”
The June 28, 2014 collapse killed 61 people, besides displacing neighbour and rendering those who booked flats, homeless.  The present petition was filed by Arun Enterprises partner C Dakshinamoorthy who could not reopen his unit because two-third of the premises came within the 50m danger zone. 
He assailed the July 1, 2014 order of the collector saying there is no mention as to under which provision did the collector pass the order declaring it a danger zone.  “He has not even mentioned the number of people whose properties are coming within the territory of danger zone and the names of people who will be adversely affected by this order,” it said, adding that the authorities had not even chosen to send a copy of the order to the affected people. 
The danger zone order itself stood out for two reasons: One, it conceded that the real cause of the collapse was yet to be ascertained. 
Secondly, it said the second 11-storied building standing just 10m from the collapsed structure is in bad shape too.  “There is an uncertainty about its structural safety and stability due to soundness of Block-A,” said the order. 
As a remedy the order said, the entire campus must be cordoned off from public entry, and that people residing in the surrounding areas of 50m should be evacuated to a safe place.  It also said all further construction activities at the site should be stopped forthwith. 
Justice Sathyanarayanan has posted the matter to August 26 for the collector to file his counter-affidavit.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Building in Chennai's Teynampet tilts after owner digs for tank  CHENNAI: A three-storey residential building in Teynampet started tilting ominously on Monday evening and would have fallen had a similar-sized building next to its left not dramatically arrested the collapse. 
The tumbling structure crushed one of the neighbouring building's balconies. 
Police and rescue personnel said no one was injured.  Families occupied houses on each floor but there were only two people within when the building started to tilt.  They got out safely. 
Officials said there were several illegalities in the construction of the building, which came up five years ago on Bhaktavachalam Street near SIET College.  This could have caused it to lose its bearings, they said, adding that they would raze the structure. 
Officials started preparations for the demolition late on Monday. 
As gawking crowds gathered, police barricaded the street it to keep people at a safe distance from the building.  At the spot were large chunks of concrete from the crushed balcony of the neighbouring building and other debris was strewn all around.  But perhaps the most important clue lay in a mound of sand nearby. 
Corporation of Chennai engineers who visited the spot said the building's occupants had started digging a sump last week and that could have weakened the building's foundations. 
"" The foundation pillars were most probably weak and, during digging for the sump, workers must have hit a spot that was bearing the load of the building,""  an engineer of corporation's Zone 9 said at the site.  Officials evacuated tenants of both buildings. 
The owner of the building, P Vellan, said he learned about what happened when neighbours telephoned him.  "" The neighbours said they felt their buildings shudder like there had been an earthquake,""  he said.  "" I rushed to the spot to see what had happened. "" 
Vellan admitted that he did not employ an engineer to plan or construct the building.  "" We used a contractor for the construction of the building,""  he said. 
"" The buildings on the street have no set-back area.  There are several violations,""  the corporation engineer said.  "" Buildings on this street can only have two storeys.  But most have more than two. "" 
The city has hundreds of illegal buildings, with owners deviating from approved plans to add floors and increase built-up space, compromising their structural integrity and jeopardising the safety of their occupants. 
Monday's episode took place just a little over a year after a 12-storey building a developer was constructing in Moulivakkam collapsed, burying 61 people in its rubble.  Investigations showed Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority had given permission to build twin towers, Trust Heights, of six storeys each but developer Prime Sristi illegally added six floors to each building without strengthening the foundation or reinforcing their columns and beams. 
"" The owners of most residential buildings do not engage engineers during construction and don't follow the approved plan,""  an official with Anna University's Centre for Disaster Management and Mitigation said.  "" These structures make up roughly 80% of the buildings in the city.  They can collapse at any time. "" 
"" I find prima facie the exact role he, being the Union minister for communications and information technology, played in misusing his office for wrongful gain by obtaining telephone connections illegally in the name of BSNL officials under service category.  As such, I do not find any frivolity in the prosecution.  Allegations which were attributed to Maran are corroborated by the material and circumstances on record,""  Justice Vaidhyanathan said.

Moulivakkam building crash: Probe panel gives clean chit to government  CHENNAI: The Justice R Reghupathi Commission of inquiry, which probed the collapse of a multi-storey building at Moulivakkam last year, has called for a legislation to make insurance mandatory for buildings under construction and fix responsibilities on various stakeholders, including developers.  It has also recommended restructuring of CMDA, the regulatory agency, to improve its technical competence.  But no government agency or official has been held responsible for failing to ensure that the building adhered to the approved plan and norms. 
Since the building was under construction and CMDA had not issued a completion certificate, the agency has gone scot-free.  The commission, in its report tabled in the assembly on Tuesday, said the builder had deviated from the approved plan and structural design.  He even knocked off pillars and increased the span of beams to accommodate driveways.  The report has recommended pulling down the second building at the Moulivakkam site by terming it a "" near future calamity"" . 
Construction firms executing mega projects should be made to keep a "" sizeable sum""  in fixed deposit for a minimum of 10 years as guarantee for quality of construction, the commission has suggested.

Reghupathi commission recommends payment of compensation to apartment buyers  CHENNAI: Justice R Reghupathi commission of inquiry that probed collapse of an 11-storey building at Moulivakkam last year said the other surviving building at the site resembled the ill-fated block "" in terms of all short-falls and deviations that contributed to the mishap"" .  The soil is loose, sandy and watery and pile foundations were not laid for a depth of 18 metres.  On the reason for the collapse of the building, the report said it was built primarily with a raft foundation and pillars were knocked off to accommodate driveways.  Experts who inspected the building detected insufficient concrete settings, cracks and punctures in columns. 
The report said the "" present tragedy is a self-speaking parable""  and said it was not known how many projects, both completed and under-construction, suffered from similar deficiencies.  "" The present instance is the best example about the dark-side behind the real estate and construction business where money is considered to be the only ambition and aim, and lives of human beings and customers are put at stake to test the duration of the feeble constructions raised by them. 
Noting that regulatory agencies lacked technical experts the commission recommended sweeping changes in CMDA's functioning including setting up of a committee comprising technical experts from CMDA, legal officers and experts in soil investigation, foundation design and structural engineering to carry out field inspections at every stage of construction of mega projects.  The committee should inspect buildings at various stages including earth work stage, laying of foundation, basement and concreting of each floor, the report said. 
Even though Tamil Nadu government has a directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption, Raghupathi has suggested setting up of a vigilance wing to keep a check on hidden and underhand transactions between officials in the regulatory agency and developers. 
As regards the loss suffered by customers who had invested in the ill-fated building and neighbours, whose houses were damaged in the disaster, the commission has urged the government to set up a committee to assess the loss and pay compensation by drawing money from the state disaster relief fund.  Buyers were still repaying loans though their apartments were completely razed, the commission pointed out and said it felt the need to go beyond its brief and suggest ways of assuaging their sufferings. 
Reacting to media reports that the government and the regulatory agency flouted norms by giving permission for high-rise buildings on a narrow road, the report said, "" Prima facie it appears there is no violation on the part of CMDA and the government in recommending relaxation (of norms). "" 
While developers welcomed most of the recommendations of the commission, they have reservations against retaining money from contractors for 10 years.  "" CMDA already retains a deposit from developers.  Blocking more money as surety will add to project cost,""  said a city developer.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Can’t order refund for buyers of Moulivakkam flats, says HC  CHENNAI: Dealing a body blow to those who had booked flats in the ill-fated Moulivakkam building that collapsed in June 2014, the Madras high court on Thursday said that it could neither order refund of the money nor compensation. 
“We are not inclined to entertain the writ petitions, as we are of the view that to fix liability in the state government for officers not complying with their obligation, a trial would have to be conducted,” said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana. 
A total of 48 people, who had booked flats in the 11-storey ‘Faith’ at Moulivakkam in Porur which collapsed on June 27, 2014, filed the present writ petition seeking refund of 17.68 crore they had together paid, besides 2.6 crore as reimbursement and another 17.68 crore as compensation.  They had cited grave financial loss, mental agony and harassment suffered due to the arbitrary acts of officials of the housing department, CMDA, directorate of town and country planning and Moulivakkam panchayat union. 
It was the commissions and omissions committed by them while granting building permission to Madurai-based Prime Sristi Housing Pvt Ltd that led to the collapse, they said in the petition. 
Several PILs, including one filed by DMK leader M K Stalin, seeking a CBI probe into the circumstances leading to the collapse of the building, various statutory relaxations offered to the builder and an order to excavate the entire location to ascertain if there were more bodies lying trapped underneath the rubble had been filed in the high court, and are pending. 
The two petitions were jointly filed by 48 flat owners who never got to see their property and are running from pillar to post, seeking help from banks to relax the loan norms and asking the government to help them out of the mess. 
Dismissing both the petitions on Thursday, the first bench said, "" It would be in the fitness of things that a decision is obtained only after trial. "" 
Pointing out that the affected people had moved the consumer court also for compensation, the judges said: "" We may also note that the petitioners have already filed claims before the consumer forum against the builders and their endeavour to rope in the state government was not successful before the forum on account of jurisdiction of the forum. "" 
The petition was then dismissed with liberty for the petitoners to pursue civil remedy in accordance with law.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  HC directs TNHB to adhere to regulations  MADURAI: Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed the Tamil Nadu Housing Board to ensure that it followed rules and regulations while constructing block of flats. 
Justices R Sudhakar and V M Velumani gave the direction to the executive engineer of the board on a petition from R Nagarajan. 
The petitioner had submitted that the board was building a multi-storeyed building in Madakulam village without obtaining plan approval from the local planning authority (LPA) and sought to restrain it from putting up unauthorised constructions. 
The petitioner had submitted that the government organisation itself was not following rules and regulations and sought a direction to the member secretary of local planning authority to initiate action against the officials concerned. 
The judges said the apprehension of the petitioner appeared to be in good faith. 
Secretary of the LPA should inspect the building and take action if there were violations. 
As the issue had been brought to the notice of the officials, they should act promptly, in accordance with law and avoid untoward incident as in Moulivakkam in Chennai, where an under-construction building collapsed claiming 61 lives last year, the judges said.

Wake up, act against illegal buildings, HC directs civic officials  CHENNAI: Illegal buildings do not spring up overnight, and there exists an unholy nexus between builders and officials of Chennai Corporation and CMDA, said the Madras high court.  It lamented that no lesson seems to have been learned even after the June 28 collapse of a multi-storey building in Moulivakkam that claimed 60 lives.  It asked the civic authorities to wake up from their slumber and act against violators. 
A division bench of Justice Satish K Agnihotri and Justice K K Sasidharan refusing to review its order against regularising a four-storied building, with 32 residential units, at Gerumbakkam village in Sriperumpudur taluk, the judges said it had been built without any planning permission, that too in the middle of an unauthorised industrial layout and it is surrounded by industries. 
The matter relates to a review petition filed by M D Varadharajan, who had purchased an unauthorised layout, which is part of an unapproved multi-industrial layout.  Without waiting for planning permission, the builder constructed stilt plus four floors, with 32 dwelling units.  His application for planning permission was rejected by CMDA, and the appeal was rejected by the government.  His writ petition, too, was dismissed in January 2014.  He has now sought review of the order, saying there are no red category industries in the vicinity and that the order was passed on a misconception. 
Rejecting the plea, the judges said: "" It would not be possible for construction of such high rise buildings overnight.  Without the knowledge of the officials, it would not be possible to construct buildings illegally.  The applicant has put up 32 residential units without planning permission.  Though the government dismissed the appeal as early as on June 21, 2013, neither CMDA nor Chennai Corporation took enforcement action.  Even after the dismissal of the writ petition, officials had not taken any action against the offending construction.  The unholy nexus between builders and officials of CMDA and corporation is writ large.  Even after the tragedy like the one that took place in Moulivakkam, the officials have not learnt lessons. "" 
Such illegal structures are a threat to the safety of occupants as well as public at large, the bench said.  Po",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'NDRF took 10hrs to reach instead of 4'  After the Moulivakkam building collapse and the recent Chennai floods,715 personnel were pressed into rescue and relief operations in flood-affected Chennai, Kancheepuram, Thiruvallur, Nagapattinam and Tuticorin.  More than 22,500 people were rescued by the NDRF .  SS Guleria, deputy inspector general (operations and training) who spoke to TOI on the rescue operations, said his units could have moved in earlier if the city airport and the naval air base in Arakkonam had not been flooded. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The state government has come in for some criticism for its co-ordination with rescue teams of Central Government.  Your comments.  As far as NDRF is concerned the golden rule is to have proper and effective co-ordination with the state govt.  We reached Chennai and established an on-site co-ordination centre inside the state emergency operation centre which was the hub of all emergency operations.  All kinds of liason officers were there and we did not face any problems in co-ordination with state government.  We were given wireless communication specifically inside state emergency centre and were in touch with state relief commissioner, police commissioner and other police officials.  Your response to allegations of central rescue teams arriving late as the state government was not prepared for this level of disaster. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disagree.  Two teams were already there.  There was no delay from the state government or NDRF.  On December 1, the airport and INS Rajali at Arakkonam was not functional so additional teams couldn't reach Chennai that day.  When did the NDRF reach Chennai? Out of 14 teams which were deployed during the floods in November, 50 teams were sent.  Could rescue teams have been moved earlier in the night of December 1 and 2? Looking at the circumstances, there was no delay.  Two NDRF teams were there and others from Arakkonam were ready.  If something was lost at that time, we can't comment.  Since the airport was not operational, additional teams which could have reached on December 1, could not.  Because of rain and flooding, teams, which could have reached in four hours, took 10 hours.  If the state government knew it was going to rain heavily, couldn't they have moved the teams earlier when it was not raining? Whenever IMD predicts rain, it is written as heavy rain, but the quantum can't be predicted by any science.  The rain which could have been spread over 24 hours, fell in 12 hours.  One must look at natu8re's fury instead of finding fault with government machinery.  Compared to the rescue operations in 2014 Jammu and Kashmir floods, how was the scenario in TN? Every disaster has its own challenges.  Since Chennai floods were an urban disaster, we had specific problems.  For example, at various places, the current was on the higher side.  There were obstacles in operating boats in certain areas as the iron roads or steel material could damage the inflatable boats.  In some places, we needed to walk a long distance, as the water wasn't deep enough to operate boats. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On a scale of 0-10, how satisfied were you with NDRF rescue operations?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We were completely satisfied; you can rate us higher than 8 or 9; we did a commendable job and rescued 22,500 people across the four districts.  Damage would have been much more if we had not been there.  How do you rate the performance of state disaster management forces? They have 120 personnel who have been trained by the NDRF and also did a commendable job. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The First Bench, comprising Chief Justice S. K.  Kaul and Justice M. M.  Sundresh, the builder-promoter. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The court said the notice sought to rely upon a government order and connected records.  When the notice was served, the petitioner sought the material to enable him to file a reply.  However,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Bench said the material ought to have been provided the petitioner to facilitate him to make his defence.  That had not been done.  On this infirmity alone, the impugned order was being quashed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The court directed authorities to hand over the complete material to the petitioner within 10 days. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The petitioner would file a reply within two weeks, thereafter.  The district collector would then pass an order as expeditiously as possible.  Now, the school education department plans to equip all children with a basic knowledge on how to deal with different kinds of crises. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the next academic year, the department is working on a curriculum that will teach children the basics of disaster management.  It will deal with both natural and man-made disasters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is stated that the forms requiring an undertaking from architects, to certify structural stability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Indian Institute of Architects and W.

The Bench observed that the petitions are more out of apprehension rather than facts.  As a general proposition, it does not accept the plea of the constrained nature of the role of an architect.  The Council of Architecture itself said an architect should play a wide role. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consequences, in the event of an incident,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The forms per se have been made as per regulations and cannot be said to be in conflict with the National Building Code of India.  ‘Probe into Moulivakkam building collapse shoddy’ Police investigation into the collapse of the multi-storeyed building in Moulivakkam on June 28 last year is shoddy, said the counsel for a petitioner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Who are they trying to protect,” the counsel asked.  Earlier, had filed a public interest litigation seeking CBI probe into the building collapse. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He also sought the quashing of a government order with respect to relaxation for the construction of the building and a direction to the authorities to demolish the remaining structure. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wilson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Periodical inspection by CMDA is a statutory requirement.  The police are trying to protect officials, he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr.  Wilson also said the structural plan which spells out the technical details of the construction had not been submitted to the authorities.  The investigating officer had simply accepted whatever the builder said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The High Court Bench posted the matter to June 30 for further hearing.  PMK wants solatium hiked for encounter victims Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss has questioned the announcement of a solatium of Rs.  3 lakh to Tamil workers who were killed in an encounter in Andhra Pradesh while the same government had given Rs.  10 lakh as solatium to workers from Andhra Pradesh who were killed in a building collapse in Moulivakkam in Chennai in June 2014. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Addressing reporters here on Sunday, he alleged that the workers were brutally murdered by the special task force personnel in Seshachalam forests.  He also questioned why the Tamil Nadu government hurriedly buried the bodies of the victims that were brought from Andhra Pradesh.  “Is the life of Tamils worthless?” he asked demanding the State government to give a solatium of Rs.  25 lakh to the families of victims apart from free houses and a government job. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over 3,000 Tamil workers are languishing in various prisons in Andhra Pradesh.  The prisoners should be released and rehabilitation measures should be taken up for them.  The government should create job opportunities and training for youth to start new business in their villages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While buildings belonging to the State government are constructed as per the National Building Code,2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Following the Moulivakkam building collapse last year, the issue of bringing private institutions under the ambit of rules is under discussion. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At present, the structural design submitted by builders or individuals is approved by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority.  However,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The State government is mulling over framing rules for private structures to ensure such building or wall collapse accidents are averted, according to sources in the Public Works Department. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Structural engineering experts suggest more columns and beams at specific gaps be provided for the stability of walls. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S.  Ramachandran, retired superintending engineer (planning and design circle, walls are built up to a height of five or six feet.  We suggest the wall be finished with a top layer of six-inch-deep and nine-inch-wide concrete beam.  These measures will ensure the walls survive heavy rains or strong winds. ” Keeping alive green patches amid a concrete jungle As you pass the busy stretches of Athipet near Ambattur, small patches of greenery greet you amidst residential and industrial localities. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though urbanisation has caught on rapidly in many localities that have been merged with the Chennai Corporation, some people continue to cultivate crops.  While some cultivate paddy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even before houses and schools started coming up in Athipet, S.  Venkatesan had been practising agriculture.  “Many people stop by in surprise to take a look at my nine-acre field and compliment me for pursuing farming in an urban area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He and his family cultivate brinjal, bottle gourd,” he added. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His desire to remain a farmer made Navasekara Reddy retain his 10-acre paddy field instead of letting it be an apartment complex.  “It is increasingly becoming difficult to cultivate paddy as I use water from borewells only.  But, I continue it as it is my family profession,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To encourage such farmers, the agriculture department distributes biofertilisers at subsidised cost.  “We create awareness about organic manure and seeds through meetings to motivate farmers”, Agriculture department. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shortage of labour and cost escalation on raw materials is slowly driving a few of them to sell bits of agricultural land that they own in Corporation limits. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A third-generation agriculturist, P.  Palanivel, they continue as it is a matter of pride.

He brings 15 persons from Cheyyar in Tiruvannamalai district to work in his field apart from his family members.  He has to depend on the team’s availability every season.  Despite the hardships, he cultivates every season as Urban Land Tax would be levied if the land is kept idle for a season or two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
K.  Rathinammal, who cultivates in her small piece of land in Baraniputhur near Kovur, Moulivakkam, Irandamkattalai and Kovur, but all have turned into housing plots now. ” The Chinese connection China is giving sleepless nights to Tamil Nadu’s bureaucracy.  Not directly but in one form or the other.  On one hand, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has been waging a legal battle with an Indo-Chinese consortium which has been taking it to court for every super-critical thermal power plant that it plans. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the other, the government’s free laptop scheme this year also has run into trouble with a manufacturer going to the courts alleging that three companies that participated in earlier tenders violated the rules by sourcing laptops from China. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the bureaucracy tends to think that anything from China comes at a lower price even if they are thermal power plants, the government was eager to seal the free laptop deal as it thought the prices quoted by the bidders were less this time leading to saving a couple of hundred crores.  Therefore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The free laptop scheme is a populist scheme and considered a game changer as the elections are scheduled next year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, especially the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), says a former urban planner. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even a year after the tragedy, the State government has not taken any step to fill the post of CMDA Vice Chairman – usually occupied by a very senior bureaucrat.  Incidentally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There has been no positive, definite response from the department to address crucial issues of safety, the CMDA announced filling up of a number of vacancies, but there seems to be no indication that the Vice-Chairman’s post will be filled.  It is likely to be a first and an achievement if the post remains vacant for the full five years of the present government. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Higher Education Minister P.

In a departure from routine, the Minister was not there to release the random number or the rank list for engineering admissions in the State.  In fact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During the release of random number and the rank list, only the Higher Education Secretary was present.

Such programmes are being held all over the State.  District Collector Archana Patnaik inaugurated the programme. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Karunanidhi questions validity of panel report on Moulivakkam DMK leader M.  Karunanidhi on Saturday questioned the validity of the report of the Justice Ragupathi Commission that probed the collapse of the multi-storeyed building in Moulivakkam, pointing out that more than six months had lapsed since the report was submitted to the government. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a statement here, he said as per 3 (4) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Though Justice Ragupathy submitted his report on October 28,2014,” Mr Karunanidhi said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He also alleged that a lot of files were waiting for clearance from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and the government, instead of obtaining her signature in every file,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Since the government is maintaining silence on the issue, such allegations are levelled.  A lot of works in the Public Works Department could not be implemented because of vacancies.  The government’s failure to fill vacancy also prevented routine promotions, which went into Moulivakkam building collapse which claimed 60 lives, would be placed in the Assembly. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When the matter came up for hearing before the First Bench, comprising Chief Justice S. K.  Kaul and Justice T. S.  Sivagnanam, said since October last year, the government had been stating that the report would be tabled in the Assembly.  The Advocate General said many sessions were convened but the report could not be tabled as the sessions were small in duration and it would be tabled in the ensuing session. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CMDA to regulate plan permission renewals After tightening procedures for issuing completion certificates for buildings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The public notice hosted on the home page of the city planning agency’s website says the CMDA has simplified the procedure of issuing planning permission renewals.  “We are streamlining and simplifying paperwork involved in issuing approvals, but the idea is to eliminate any complacency that may creep in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For instance, the new notification insists builders furnish only the original approved plan sanctions and letters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After ensuring that the supporting documents along with the application for renewal for planning permission are in order, authorities will accept the stipulated scrutiny fee from the builder. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“The blame for the delay in not handing over projects on time is passed on to us for not issuing approvals on time and we want to correct this,” the source said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Yes, theoretically it has now been simplified, a western Chennai suburb.  Assembly session will test Opposition strategy With Ms.  Jayalalithaa’s return as Chief Minister, the Assembly session slated to begin on August 24 will be a test for cohesiveness and the pursuit of a common agenda among various Opposition parties. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For weeks now, the Opposition has focused on the issue of prohibition, now that elections are round the corner.  The ruling party, strengthened by the removal of legal hurdles for Ms.  Jayalalithaa, is ready to take on the Opposition, particularly the DMK and the DMDK. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the last session, the ruling AIADMK managed to keep the Opposition at bay even without the presence of party supremo Jayalalithaa, also failed to make up for the absence of his party members, who were expelled from the House. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As elections are only eight months away, Mr.  Vijayakant will be keenly watched.  In the last session,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Opposition would have to reinvent itself to place its arguments without sparking any controversy that will lead to walkouts or evictions. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The session following the budget is usually lengthy, and provides ample time to discuss the demands for grants to various departments.  Apart from prohibition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After it emerged that the Adani Group had bid way lower in Madhya Pradesh than the Rs 7.01 per unit with Tamil Nadu's Tangedco, the Opposition has been demanding either the scrapping of the deal or a white paper. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the victims was located by Rustum after 72 hours of remaining under the debris.  Both Rustum and Dil were honoured by the Chief Minister during a function organised by the Tamil Nadu government.  These dogs were also engaged in rescue operations during the train accident at Sitheri near Arakkonam two years ago. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contending that the Collector had passed the order based on the findings of the other agencies like the One Man Commission and Anna University without application of mind, the petitioner’s counsel contended that the orders violated the principles of natural justice. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Accepting the contentions, the judge held that further proceedings in the Collector’s order showed that much reliance has been placed on the Justice R.  Regupathy Commission’s report on the building collapse. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basheer Bagh Palace,"Hyderabad's opulent palaces a pale shadow of their past  HYDERABAD: Hyderabad's rich and resplendent past is best reflected in its historic structures, especially opulent palaces located in the old quarters of the city __ some of which have, sadly, been razed to the ground over the years.  Turn the pages of history and one is sure to be awestruck by the tales of these sprawling palatial structures that housed not just members of the Nizams' family, but also feudal lords who made Hyderabad their home. 
Intricately designed and elaborately decorated, these palaces (or deodis like some of them are called) were once synonymous with the city that boasted of at least a few dozen such structures, until a few decades ago.  What remains now is a poor shadow of the affluent past that the royals of Hyderabad flaunted. 
However, some of them have now come alive in the pages of 'Images of Hyderabad' (Volume-II), a recently compiled book by Urdu daily Siasat that deals extensively with the city's once mesmerizing palaces.  The first volume was published in 2012. 
"" This book is a continuation of the first part and highlights the palaces and royal buildings that Hyderabad once had.  The idea behind bringing out these books was to refresh the memory of people about the rich heritage that the city has always been known for,""  said Zahid Ali Khan, editor of Siasat, confessing that most of the monuments that find a place in the book, no longer exist today.  Living room of Basheer Bagh Palace.  "" The only palace that still exists in totality is the Falaknuma Palace.  Though the Chowmahalla Palace too is better of the lot, what you see is only 50% of the original structure,""  rued heritage activist Sajjad Shahid listing out at least half a dozen such palaces that have either been demolished or are on the verge of falling apart.  Be it the Purani Haveli or the King Koti Palace or even the Mahbubnagar Palace __ all share the same fate.  "" A palace cannot be considered a palace if the intervening space between its gate and the building seizes to exist.  It is the surrounding environment that makes a structure a palace __ complete with its gardens and the works.  But most of what remains toady is just a building,""  Shahid added. 
Other historians point to the area behind the Chowk in the Old City where once stood a chain of architectural beauties: the Moin-ud-Daula ki Deodi, the Khurshid Jah ki Deodi (only the entrance and the front room of this remains now), the Iqbal-Ud-Daula ki Deodi and so on.  Today, they are nothing more than an eyesore, old-timers lament.  A historical photograph of Chandulal Baradari.  "" There are two reasons for their decay.  Firstly, members of the Nizams' family themselves neglected these palaces once they were built.  Later, the successive governments turned their back on them,""  explained historian and scholar Allama Aijaz Farruq, who recently assisted the Siasat in compiling a book that takes readers on a beautiful pictorial tour of the city's palaces.  British residency main building.  Of the many structures that find a mention in the book, only a handful still dot the city's landscape.  "" The beautiful Basheer Bagh palace has been wiped out.  The Hill Fort Palace that housed Moazzam Jah and was later turned into Ritz Hotel now lies covered under blue sheets.  Even the Bella Vista that's become the Administrative Staff College premises now was a magnificent structure at one point in time.  Now its several shades paler,""  the historian said.  The Malwala Palace, Chandulal ki Deodi, Jahanuma Palace are some of the other structures which have fallen prey to the vagaries of time and neglect. 
Heritage lovers hope that the authorities wake up at least now and try and preserve whatever little still remains of Hyderabad's glorious history.

Iyyer Bungalow,"Walk for health, pay with life  MADURAI: The recent murder of S Kasthuri, a 65-year-old widow who lived in the Iyyer Bungalow area, during her morning walk has once again placed the issue of morning-walk murders under the limelight.  Several times in the past, high-profile personalities and ordinary people like Kasthuri have been targeted during their daily walks, especially in the morning. 
A senior police official on the condition of anonymity said most of the murders that took place during morning walks were preplanned.  For one thing, due to relaxed security and the general absence of large number of people on the spot, politicians and other high-profile figures are comparatively more accessible during their walks.  There would hardly be any people on the road early in the morning.  The timing of the targeted person is predictable.  There is also a lax in the security checks by police, making it easier to get away. 
Many politicians have been targeted and murdered this way in the past.  In May, 2003, T Krishnan, DMK leader and former minister, was hacked to death near his residence in K K Nagar while returning from his morning walk.  He was the minister for highways department and a powerful figure in the district before the emergence of former union minister M K Alagiri. 
In Trichy, former DMK minister K N Nehru’s brother Ramajayam was kidnapped when he left his house for a walk at 5am in March, 2012 and then murdered.  His body was later found inside bushes at Ponni delta near Thiruvalarsolai-Kallanai Road. 
In yet another high-profile incident with similar circumstances, former law minister V Arunachalam aka Aladi Aruna, 70, was murdered by a gang near Alangudi in Tirunelveli district in January, 2005.  The gang struck when he was in a secluded area on Tirunelveli-Tenkasi highway after he left his house at 6.15 am. 
Recently, K Ezhumalai, 43, an AIADMK functionary who used to reside in Adambakkam in Chennai, was murdered while he was returning from his morning walk at around 6.45 am.  He was murdered near TNHD Colony Main Road in Velachery in December, 2014.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Khobramenda,"Naxal beats up foresters on charges of corruption  GADCHIROLI : A forest guard and round officer were thrashed by senior Naxal cadres to protest alleged corruption by their department.  Senior Naxal cadre Vikas took an aggressive stance against foresters at Yedaskuhi village in north Gadchiroli to convey their dissent against the department. 
Sources stated that the Naxals were trying to mount pressure on foresters and also on the local population for dominance during the forthcoming Tendu leaves picking season in the district which is a multi-crore seasonal industry.  Naxals aim to collect substantial party funds from foresters, tendu contractors and transporters during this tendu season.  The rebels also collect donations for the party from the tribal population who engages in picking tendu. 
A senior police official stated that Naxals targeting foresters is nothing unusual on various issues, ranging from corruption to exploitation of tribals.  “Intelligence agencies have underlined the fact that a section of Naxals are trying to capitalize on the wrath of the tribal against foresters and are also trying to incite them to target the grassroots level personnel like forest guards and round officers,” said a senior officer.  He added that Naxals are targeting foresters on local issues like bamboo cutting and transportation, auction of tendu, allotment of stretches for farming and trading of the local forest produce. 
According to a reliable source, Naxals manhandled the two foresters protesting corruption in allotting solar powered pump machines to tribals for farming.  It’s also learnt that some goof-ups related to allotment of compartments led to destruction of substantial stacks of bamboo in Khobramenda.  The tribal population was deprived of daily wages too as the work allotment had come under scanner leading to major public loss, it was learnt.  The incident has left the senior Naxal cadre angry too. 
Police also stated that surrendered Naxal cadre Gopi, once a senior leader in the party, has also informed that top forest officials extended monetary favours to Naxals through their messengers.  The revelation has also tarnished image of the rebels, leading to their wrath. 
Sources said that Naxals are also targeting foresters for being hand-in-glove with teakwood smugglers in south Gadchiroli.  The rebels are learnt to be unhappy with foresters for allowing contractors to misuse sand and gravel from the forest and riverbeds for construction of roads and undertaking other activities.

Propaganda war over young Naxal cadre’s death  NAGPUR: The death of a young student leader-turned-Naxal commander in an encounter with police last year has been the cause of a fresh propaganda war between the Naxalite leaders and their opponents.  The top echelons of banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) have hailed the death of Raja Thakur, alias Comrade Krishna (27), as supreme sacrifice by a young visionary in the red rebels’ cause.  On the other hand, activists opposed to Naxalite ideology have slammed the efforts of CPI (Maoist) for trapping youngsters in their lost cause of armed revolution.  Both CPI (Maoist) and Bhoomkal Sangathan, have re-launched a fresh propaganda war by issuing pamphlets.  An earlier pamphlet, issued by Maharashtra state committee secretary Comrade Sahyadri during recently concluded ‘Martyrs’ week’, had underlined the unique blend of bravery and intellectualism in Krishna who was killed along with colleague Comrade Sonu on August 12 last year in Khobramenda jungle in a police encounter.  Arvind Sovani and Datta Shirke, both office bearers of Bhoomkal Sangathan, have blamed Naxals for roping in youngsters through front organizations in armed movement foiling their academic career.  Intelligence agencies view Naxals’ romanticizing of Krishna’s sacrifice during the Naxal’s martyr week, observed between July 27 and August 3, as an effective strategy to encourage urban youngsters to join the movement or support it.  Krishna, a former student of Rajura’s Shivaji College, was section deputy commander of Platoon 56 while Sonu held the same rank for Platoon 55.  The two, along with three others, were returning from Nadekal village to their den when security forces ambushed them.  The Naxals claimed that police eliminated the duo when they could have been arrested.  The rebels have extolled the qualities of Krishna in the movement citing that he carried out effective propaganda against displacement and industrialization whenever required in the remote areas and also fought bravely when faced with challenge from police.  The social activists too have upped their propaganda against the rebels warning youngsters to be wary of attempts to recruiting them through urban front organizations and that they would be deployed in the guerrilla zones to participate in the armed revolution.  Citing claims of Naxals that Comrade Krishna was a member of ‘Krantikari Vidhyarthi Sanghatna’ or revolutionary student organization, activists claimed the rebels misguided the former student into joining the movement that claimed his life.  Sovani and Shirke warned youngsters in Nagpur, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli not to fall prey to such attempts by the Naxals through so-called front organizations.  The activists have also warned that more such front organization, including one in Nagpur, are at present active.  Superintendent of police, Gadchiroli, Sandip Patil said government is already implementing several enactments for the tribals and their interest.  “The Naxals and their front organizations can help in better implementation of government schemes rather than ask youngsters to take up arms and ruin their life.  We can support surrenders but not one with arms,” said Patil. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Thangasseri,"Transforming lighthouses into tourism destinations ochi has been chosen along with Chennai and Vishakapatnam by the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL), Ministry of Shipping, to host road shows for its ambitious programme to transform lighthouses into “unique tourism destinations”. 
The DGLL carried out a techno-economic feasibility study for 12 lighthouses, of which request for qualification has been issued for eight sites, including Kadalur Point lighthouse near Kannur. 
Kochi will host the first road show on October 14.  The road shows were being organised with the help of the respective Port Trusts and would culminate in an investors’ meet in Mumbai on October 29, said a release.  Chettuva, Vypeen, Manakkodam, Vizhinjam, Thangasseri, Kannur, Alappuzha and Kadalur Point were the lighthouses selected in Kerala for the tourism development programme, said the release.  Kadamat, Thinakaara, Agathi, Androth, West End, Kavaratti and Suhelipar are among the 10 lighthouses on the Lakshwadeep Islands selected for the programme. 
Lighthouses in the programme from other States include Aguada in Goa; Kanyakumari and Muttam in Tamil Nadu and Sunk Rock off Mumbai. 
“Though generally perceived as navigational aids, lighthouses are also symbols of history and icons of maritime heritage”, said the government document inviting the expression of interest. 
Primarily, the programme hinges on the historic value of the lighthouses. 
For example, the Vypeen lighthouse was first erected in 1839 and was replaced with an RCC structure in 1979.  The Thangassery lighthouse is 112-years-old and has an average tourist flow of about 5,000 per month. 
The Manakkodam lighthouse, near Cherthala, was commissioned in 1979 and has a scenic foreground with substantial beach area. 
The tourism facilities being envisaged at these sites include viewing galleries, information and souvenir centres, eco-resorts with camp sites, restaurants and food cafes, family entertainment centres, sound and light laser shows, art and craft villages and accommodation facilities.

Palani Hills,"Seizure of leopard pelt raises concern  MADURAI: Seizure of a leopard pelt at Oddanchatram in the district on Tuesday has turned out to be a cause of concern for wildlife enthusiasts in the region as they suspect a network of poachers operating in the region. 
In September last year, forest officials seized two leopard skins and three Sambar antlers in Oddanchatram.  Five persons were arrested in this regard.  In Tuesday’s incident, Devathanapatti forest ranger, Karupiah and Tamil Nadu Green Movement joint secretary, S Jayachandran acted as buyers following a tip off.  After being led to various locations for the entire day, the kingpin M Ganesan and his accomplices showed up in the evening.  They were detained. 
“Though we don’t see any large scale mafia operating here, we suspect some network dealing with wildlife products.  The leopard skin seized on Tuesday was professionally tanned,” said Jayachandran.  Though it was coincidental that two seizures occurred in Oddanchatram, wildlife enthusiasts feel that it could be a transit point since the town is situated downhill of Palani Hills.  In both incidents last year, the big cats were poached in Palani Hills. 
“Oddanchatram could be a transit point of smugglers.  We learn that there is a gang of expert game hunters in Varusanadu region but they don’t operate in the locality.  Gangs operating locally could be from Tamil Nadu and Kerala”, said C P Rajkumar of Vaigai Association of Nature and Mountain Ranges (VANAM).  Wildlife activists feel that forest department with lack of manpower is no match for smugglers. 
Wildlife officials too suspect some small gangs operating in the region.  “There should be a thorough investigation to trace these gangs of poachers and their network of smuggling”, a wildlife official from Theni said.  “Most of the time, even if we spot some big cats in forests we maintain confidentiality because poaching mafia has got eyes and ears everywhere,” another wildlife official said.  But wildlife activists feel that Forest Department crippled with lack of manpower is no match to smugglers.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Traffic runs through MTR at night for temple fest  CHENNAI: Permission to allow vehicles through Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and the core forest areas at night for five days for a temple festival has shocked conservationists and wildlife lovers. 
Until last year, the temple festival was held for about two days.  This year, the annual festival of the Mariamman Temple in Bokkapuram village is being held from February 27 to March 3 and traffic restrictions on the road from Gudalur to Bokkapuram via Theppakkadu and Masinagudi have been lifted to benefit devotees.  Vehicles are usually not allowed through the forest between dusk and dawn to allow free movement of animals. 
Bokkapuram village is bounded by Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park in the north and by Nilgiris North forest division on the other three sides.  MTR is less than a kilometre from Bokkapuram and Nilgiris north division is ecologically similar to MTR and forms the sanctuaryâs buffer zone. 
âIt is a matter of great concern that the district administration has relaxed the restriction on night traffic on roads passing through Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and its nearby forested areas to facilitate the temple festival around Bokkapuram village.  Vehicles plying at speed on these roads will not only cause great disturbance to wildlife, but are also likely to maim or kill animals,â said wildlife filmmaker and conservationist Shekar Dattatri. 
Nilgiris district collector P Sankar said the restrictions on night-time traffic had been lifted temporarily to help pilgrims.  âPeople have been visiting the temple for years.  If the district administration did not permit vehicles to take pilgrims to the temple at night, it would become a problem,â he said. 
However, there are examples of officials and conservationists working with devotees to ensure that wildlife movement is not affected.  In Hediyala range in Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka, for instance, forest officials and conservationists spent time explaining how temple activities at night in the core forest affected wildlife.  D Rajkumar of Wildlife Conservation Foundation, Karnataka, who was part of the effort, said officials and conservationists should work with locals and resolve the issue amicably.  âShops would be put up for the temple festival every year within in the forest.  My team and forest officers explained the effects of shops in core areas to the residents.  Over the last two years, no shops were put up in the core areas,â he said. 
N Arun Sankar, secretary of Palani Hills Conservation Council, said the forest department lacked adequate manpower.  âIt will be very difficult to monitor the movement of visitors at night and ensure there is no harm to wildlife,â he said.

Dolmen a major attraction of Sirumalai  MADURAI: The stone structure could be taken for an ordinary boulder if one does not pay close attention, but the lone dolmen inside the Sirumalai forest in Madurai district is an ancient artefact pointing to possible human habitation in the area several centuries ago.  Situated some 2km above Kutladampatti Falls in an area called Thadagainachi kovil, the stone walls with a flat stone on top possibly dates back to prehistoric Iron Age, according to scholars. 
The dolmen was an accidental discovery, found when officials from the district forest office were charting out nature trails inside forest areas to promote eco-tourism and provide livelihood to tribal youth.  The department carved out four trails- Bison Trail, Deer Trail, Hare Trail and Snake Trail.  The dolmen was found on the 18km-long Bison Trail, which descends from upper Sirumalai to Kutladampatti falls. 
“It was an added feature on our Bison Trail,” said Madurai district forest officer (DFO) Nihar Ranjan. 
A dolmen in the middle of the forest means that there was human settlement in the area once, according to archaeologists.  Such structures were burial places in the prehistoric Iron Age.  The dolmens in the region are scattered across Palani Hills.  Thandikudi is a prominent site.  Dolmens were also spotted in Pandrimalai near Dindigul, scholars said. 
“There is every possibility for a dolmen in Sirumalai because there are many dolmens spread across the hillocks of the region,” said V Vedachalam, retired archaeologist in the city.  Such archaeological structures of anthropological importance should be protected well, archaeologists feel. 
The DFO said anyone who wants to pay a visit to the place should get prior permission from the department as it falls under protected area.

Gurunath, once CSK's face, takes another knock  CHENNAI: From being one of Chennai Super Kings' most visible faces to the ignominy that followed after being charged with placing bets and passing on team information - Gurunath Meiyappan's affair with IPL has been storied.  The Lodha Committee on Tuesday suspended Gurunath, former BCCI chief and India Cements director N Srinivasan's son-in-law, from being involved in any cricket-related activity for life. 
Gurunath is Grandson of A V Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, but cinema did not hold his interest.  The fast lane to success caught his fancy and IPL perfectly suited his ambitions.  Not too visible in IPL 1, Gurunath since 2009 became known as a ringside monitor of the team.  "" He used to be present during team meetings.  He was more friendly with the big boys like Dhoni and Raina,""  a team member said. 
In September 2013, the Mumbai police named Gurunath in a chargesheet, accusing him of cheating, betting, and conspiracy.  "" We play to win but want to do so in the right fashion.  We were guided by what we wanted, while keeping an eye on the rest of the franchises,""  Gurunath is reported to have once said.  According to an insider, one evening, after he was named in the betting scandal, a family member castigated Gurunath for bringing disrepute and he broke down.  Srinivasan, according to sources, too was left seething and instructed his son-in-law to stay away from CSK matches.  The portion of AVM studios in Vadapalani, belonging to Gurunath's father AVM Balasubramanian, which was built to accommodate the lavish and opulent sets of MGR's 1966 runaway hit Anbe Vaa, was razed a few months back with Gurunath putting out the land for realtor friend Vikram Aggarwal with a plan of developing close to 600 apartments in its place.

Woman killed in elephant attack in Oddanchatram With the destruction of the elephant corridor in Lower Palani Hills and in Oddanchatram area, conflicts between humans and wild animals, especially elephants, have increased in the district. 
On Wednesday, a lone wild elephant fatally attacked a woman, Pappa (40), at Pulikuthukadu on Pachalur Hills near Oddanchatram. 
The elephant caught hold of her and threw her away while she was going to a private farm in the early hours. 
Local people rushed her to Oddanchatram Government Hospital where doctors advised them to take her to Dindigul GH as her condition was very critical.  But she succumbed to her injuries on the way to Dindigul hospital. 
According to local people, attacks by wild animals were on the rise in Oddanchatram and Palani blocks.  Forest officials said that destruction of elephants’ regular path by local people for farm activities forced the animals to find new paths close to residential areas for food and water. 
Herds of elephants had been moving from Kudiraiyaru dam to Oddanchatram through Palar Porundalar dam area.  Attacks on humans were rampant at Thekkankottai, Kombaipatti, Sattaparai and Varadhapattinam in Palani block. 
With farmers in Kodaiakanal having constructed a small check dam and blocked the flow of water to Varadhamanadhi dam, elephants now had started climbing up to Anjuveedu area near Vilpatti in Kodaikanal Hills for water and feed. 
A herd of six elephants and a newborn calf had been camping near a residential area for the past one month. 
Farmers could not chase the animals away, they said.  The Forest Department deputed a 10-member team to chase the elephant herd into interior forests on Tuesday.  It would be difficult to chase the elephants as they were attracted by jackfruits. 
They reached the spot when the jackfruit harvesting season was at its peak in Kodaikanal last month.  With availability of sumptuous feed and water, they refused to leave Vilpatti area, they added. 
Local people say attacks by wild animals are on the rise in Oddanchatram and Palani blocks Activists oppose clearcutting of exotic species in Palani Hills Naturalists and environmentalists here have appealed to the government to be cautious while removing exotic species like wattle and eucalyptus which are spread in more than 200 square km in the Palni hills. 
The Forest Department has a proposal for clear cutting these two exotic species.  “Clearcutting will be an ecological disaster affecting the entire ecosystem of the watersheds across north and south of the Palni Hills,” says Pippa Mukherjee of INTACH. 
Instead, the department should let Shola (rainforest) species to grow and prosper in the wattle shade and finally overtake the exotic species.  This can effectively stop the spread of wattle in the grasslands, say activists. 
“In this process, the wattle will die of fungal disease naturally without sunlight,” says Ms.  Mukherjee. 
“We should understand that old wattle forest will act as a nursery for new shola [native species] growth because many of the shola species like shade to germinate and wattle lives on sun light,” she added. 
Using chainsaws to remove wattle would certainly worsen the situation, warn activists, emphasising that clearcutting wattle as part of forestry management or resource management could prove to have disastrous consequences.  World over, clear cutting is seen as detrimental to rain forest ecosystems, she said. 
After clearcutting of wattle, lantana camera (unni) and other exotic, bushy weeds would grow with the exposure to the heat and light in the open field.  Moreover, sunlight simply encourages regeneration of tonnes of wattle seeds that remain viable for germination for fifty years.  Indiscriminate felling of wattle and eucalyptus would also annihilate new shola saplings and other small trees, says R.  Kannan of Palni Hills Conservation Council (PHCC). 
A guided tour of the clearcut areas would certainly offer a first-hand experience of the irremediable devastation already wrought in the Palni Hills, he said, urging the government to take up a short term survey. 
Silviculture
“Movement of heavy vehicles into plantation areas would also destroy regeneration of native species.  Ultimately, it would lead to mini-ecological disaster.  Inhibit its spread from plantations into existing native grasslands through regular culling.  Allowing them to die naturally would be viable solution to wattle menace,” recommends P.  R.  Ashok Raj of ACT India Foundation. 
To restore Shola forests, Aalap Dikshit, Department of Natural Resources, TERI University, New Delhi, who did research on wattle in Kodaikanal, too opposes removing acacia plantations and to consider silvicultural options in the management of the plantations to enhance the nursing effect on shola tree species. 
Directing the State government to file a status report before on September 28, the Madras High Court made it clear that it was not issuing any direction to cut down wattle and eucalyptus trees from the Western Ghats.

Old Rajarajeswaripeta,"Culvert widening work to start soon It is a perennial problem.  In summer, trash and drainage overflow onto the roads from drains, and in rainy season, rain water from hill slopes reaches roads, as the existing culverts are too narrow. 
This has been the case at Nyzam Gate in Wynchipeta and Zero Bulbline in Old Rajarajeswaripeta for the past several years. 
Lack of a sound drainage system is causing severe inconvenience to residents of Wynchipeta, Gandhi Bomma centre, Abotu Appana Pakalaveedhi and old Rajarajeswaripeta. 
Drainage water from drains at Nyzam Gate and Zero Bulbline flows under the railway tracks towards Budameru. 
Since the drains were laid decades ago, and with the population rising, residents have been demanding that the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) improve the existing infrastructure.  It was conveyed to VMC Commissioner G.  Veerapandian during his inspection of these localities recently. 
To widen the existing culverts and mitigate the problem, the VMC authorities have proposed box culverts to replace the decades-old masonry culverts. 
Deposit sought
Accordingly, the railway authorities have demanded a deposit of Rs.  10.30 crore, as the culverts have to be constructed beneath the tracks, said Vijayawada West MLA Jaleel Khan. 
Rs.  47 crore
sanctioned
Following several representations, the government sanctioned Rs.  47 crore towards the construction of major outfall drains, culverts across railway tracks, including Nyzam Gate and Zero Bulbline gate. 
Works are likely to commence in June, Mr.  Khan claimed. 
Lack of proper drainage system causing difficulty to residents of Wynchipeta, Gandhi Bomma centre, Abotu Appana Pakalaveedhi & old Rajarajeswaripeta City fringes stink as strike enters 10th day : The ongoing municipal strike, which entered the tenth day on Monday, is leaving the colonies and areas in Payakapuram, Kandriga and other areas on the city fringes stinking with garbage piling up on the streets. 
Ever since the strike commenced, things have gone worse in many areas beyond Ajitsinghnagar flyover, Vambay Colony, Old Rajarajeswaripeta and others.  All the corporation did was to deploy a few workers and clear trash in a few areas, while leaving others to their plight. 
“It is a typical problem here.  While, regular workers obstruct the private workers in clearing the garbage, residents keep complaining about the heaps of garbage on the streets.  Despite requests the self help groups are finding it difficult to mobilise workers,” says A.  Shailaja, Corporator of 59{+t}{+h}Division. 
On the other hand, Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials claim of initiating stringent action against officials and contractors, who fail to supply more workers and monitor the garbage clearing.  On Monday, VMC Commissioner G.  Veerapandian inspected the sanitary situation in Gulabithota, Government press, Madhuranagar, Bhavajipeta and others, he noticed garbage piling up on the street corners. 
When enquired, officials informed that there was delay in supply of trucks from vehicles depot to clear garbage.  Holding the depot assistant manager for the delay, the Commissioner instructed the officials to suspend him from duties. 
Meanwhile, political parties have extended their support to the ongoing municipal workers strike.  The leaders have decided to lay siege to all municipal corporations offices on June 22 and the Collector’s Camp Office on June 24 and have threatened to intensify the strike.  Addressing at the roundtable organised by the A. P.  Municipal Workers and Employees Joint Action Committee, former MP P.  Madhu said the CPI(M) would stand by the workers and pressurise the government in revising the workers wages. 
BJP Krishna Unit president R.  Venkatakrishna said it was high time for the government to negotiate with striking workers and address their genuine demands.

Aghamkuan," In Bihar, 14 officers man food safety in 1.5 lakh shops  PATNA: Food safety is a matter of concern, thanks to a nationwide row over Maggi.  Biharâs food safety wing has, however, only 14 officers to man its 38 districts.  In contrast, the food safety officers number 554 in Tamil Nadu, 273 in UP, 178 in Gujarat, 169 in Madhya Pradesh and 87 in Jammu & Kashmir, according to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) website. 
Bihar food safety commissioner Anand Kishor candidly admits this wing is understaffed.  âBut the health department has accepted a proposal to create 625 posts of food safety officers.  The finance department will soon give its nod to it,â he said.  READ ALSO: Bold message in biggest food item recall The state food safety wing has been functioning with skeletal staff for long, and this has hit the departmentâs functioning adversely.  According to an official report for 2014-15, there are at least 1.5 lakh food business operators in the state.  But only 23,435 are registered and 8,678 are licensed.  That is, only 32,000 or so are on the radar. 
This is in contravention of the FSSAI guidelines according to which any food unit having an annual turnover of up to Rs 12 lakh has to be registered.  Those having a turnover of more than Rs 12 lakh have to be licensed.  The mandate to register or license such units lies with the food safety officers.

âWe advertised the post twice, but we could not get anyone who fulfilled the eligibility criteria.  We cannot change the criteria because they are prescribed by the Centre,â Kishor says. 
The state food safety wing for now relies on a private Kolkata lab which is accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.  However, this arrangement has its own drawbacks.  As the Maggi saga unfolded, Bihar sent the first lot samples on May 23.  But till May 6, the test reports did not come, the state food safety wingâs repeated requests for expediting the tests notwithstanding. 
âThough test reports usually come within 14 days; at times they donât,â one official disclosed. 
Pendency of cases in courts adds to the woes of food safety wing which does not have a lawyer of its own.  The officers have to coordinate with government counsel concerned to pursue the cases.

In India, these birds are commonly found in states like Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.  However, in Maharashtra the birds are only found in Bhandara and Gondia districts, though there is sparse record of a couple of birds in Chandrapur district.  The birds, predominantly having grey plumage with a naked red head and long neck and long red pale legs, are considered as symbol of marital fidelity.  There are sagas told about love and affection of sarus for each other.  The birds are mostly found in paddy fields and spotted in Paraswada, Zhilmili and Ghattemani villages.  In February 2014, bird lovers sighted flock of 24 sarus cranes.  This was the biggest record after 1970, when 32 cranes were sighted by Madhavrao Dongarwar Patil in Navegaon Bandh.  However, the tall birds have completely vanished from Gothangaon, near Navegaon Bandh, where hundreds of tourists use to sight them regularly.  However, many birds died due to large-scale use of pesticides by farmers .  “Though the life cycle of these birds is 70-75 years, due to habitat destruction their numbers are dwindling drastically.  Our efforts are to revive their numbers by creating massive awareness among locals,” says Sawan Bahekar, honorary district wildlife warden of Gondia.  Bahekar said the month-long festival will focus on wildlife, adventurous, archaeological and heritage and religious tourism circuits in Gondia district.

Thaticheltapalem,"Ganesha pandals come up with social messages to educate people  VISAKHAPATNAM: Theme-based Ganeshas with social messages seem to be gaining popularity among pandal organizers in the Port City.  So while the giant 111-feet and 80-feet Ganesha idols at Gajuwaka have been attracting thousands of devotees just to have a glimpse of their awe-inspiring stature, there are several pandal organisers that are trying to spread social messages with the help of their Vinayaka idols. 
One such Ganesha propagating the importance of the environment is the Teacup Ganesha made entirely of biodegradable paper cups that has been installed by the Yuva Seva Foundation of Thaticheltapalem in the city. 
"" We wanted to spread the message about the need to stop using plastic and to safeguard our environment - especially after cyclone Hudhud ravaged our city last year.  So we decided to make a Ganesha from paper cups that are biodegradable.  We have used 2,525 teacups for making our Ganesha idol.  Apart from this, we are getting in touch with several other pandal organisors to plant saplings in their areas.  We plan to donate around 2,000 saplings as part of our drive, so that by next year we can have a greener Vizag,""  said Yuva Seva Foundation founder P Hariprasad. 
"" Papercups are biodegradable, unlike plastic cups that harm the environment,""  said Prof PS Rajasekhar of Andhra University's environmental sciences department, adding that the public should avoid using plastic to protect the environment. 
Meanwhile, a group of youth from Ashoknagar in Kancherapalem have put up a nattily dressed Ganesha riding a bike wearing a helmet with his mooshak in helmet riding pillion.  N Venkatesh, the pandal organizer said they came up with this innovative idea to improve awareness about using helmets following the death of some friends a few months ago. 
"" Two of our childhood friends died about four months ago when their two-wheeler was hit by a lorry.  We are hoping that youngsters will learn from this and be careful while riding as well as use helmets for their safety,""  he explained. 
Apart from these Ganesha pandals carrying messages of social responsibility, the Tollywood bug has bitten a group in the Old Town area, which has made a Bahubali Ganesha portraying actor Prabhas, replete with eight pack abs, carrying the Shivalingam.  "" We never really expected to see the Bahubali type of Ganesha, but after hearing about it we came to see it all the way from Gajuwaka,""  said Prakash Rao, who said he watched the movie five times. 
Meanwhile, another Ganesha dressed in a football jersey with a football ground as the backdrop in the Old Town area, and a Vinayaka idol made out of vegetable at Kancherapalem also witnessed huge crowds over the last two days. 
A Ganesha in scuba diving gear with miniature fishing vessels in a water tank have been put up on display at the Fishing Harbour, whereas a Ganesha in a Kalasham and another in the form of Buddha has been set up near Kailaspuram.

Kuttippadom,"Land sales in Perumbavoor touch new low  KOCHI: When the over 1,200 plywood units in Perumbavoor area attracted migrant workers by the hordes, local residents may not have anticipated such a fall out.  Nor would they have foreseen the pollution that came along with the plywood industry boom in the area that spelt prosperity. 
In Kuttipadom, a tiny village with a radius of less than 3km in Vengola panchayat near Perumbavoor, migrants now outnumber the around 3,000-strong locals.  Conversely, the socio-environmental issues created by around 25 plywood manufacturing units employing migrants in the village are forcing many residents to sell their land and leave the area.  But, in what can be called a double whammy of inverse development logic, there are no takers for their land. 
Many people in the surrounding panchayats and Perumbavoor municipality face a similar problem.  “There are around 1,200 plywood manufacturing units in Perumbavoor municipality and panchayats such as Rayamangalam, Asamanoor, Kottappady, Payipra, Okkal, Koovappady and Vazhakkulam panchayats.  People in these areas face high pollution from plywood units and socio-cultural issues arising from the migrant population.  In certain areas like Kuttippadom, the migrant population outnumber locals,’’ said Varghese Pulluvazhy, chairman, Action Council for Environmental Protection. 
“Urea formaldehyde, a chemical used for manufacturing plywood, is a known carcinogen that can cause cancer.  Inhaling the smoke from the plywood units can also cause cancer.  The number of cancer cases in these areas are on the rise,” he said.  The plywood units pollute water bodies in the area as well, he said. 
Officials with the registration department also admitted that there has been a dip in land deals in the area. 
“A year ago, we used to have 50 to 70 land registrations every day.  Now, it has come down to 15 to 30,” said K Anil Krishna, sub-registrar, Perumbavoor. 
“Though, we don’t have locality-wise registration details, we can certainly say that transactions in the areas where plywood units are mushrooming have dipped.  While conducting an inquiry into the decrease in transactions, many attributed the phenomenon to mushrooming plywood units with high migrant population,” he said. 
According to owners of the plywood manufacturing units, they follow all the norms set by the pollution control board (PCB). 
“There are certain problems that have risen out of concentration of such units in some areas.  That’s quite natural,” said M M Mujeebur Rahman, state president, Sawmill Owners and Plywood Manufacturers Association. 
“The complainants were the same people who gave their land at exorbitant rates to plywood unit owners when such units were set up,” he said. 
In 2013, a Central empowered committee (CEC), set up by the Supreme Court, had conducted a sitting in Perumbavoor to hear complaints regarding pollution in the area. 
“The CEC submitted its report to the state government last year.  It is learnt that the CEC’s report contains suggestions to ease the woes of locals,” Varghese said.

Manassery,"A call to repeal draconian laws Yahya Khan aka Kammukutty who reached home at Mukkom in the district after he was released from Dharwad Central Jail, Karnataka, feels that draconian laws such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act should be repealed. 
“I spent seven years and three months in prison.  I am a victim of a misused law.  Even the trial commenced only after three years,” he said.  Yahya was one of the 17 persons acquitted by Additional Sessions and District Court judge Gopal Krishna Kolli last week as the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them. 
The case
The Bengaluru police had suspected them to be members of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and charged them with involvement in terror activities across Karnataka and waging war against the country. 
While four persons, including brothers P. A.  Shadhuli and Sabit Shibli (Erattupetta) and Ansar Nadwi (Aluva) belonged to Kerala, others were from Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. 
An electronics and communication graduate from the National Institute of Technology- Calicut (NIT-C), Yahya Khan, had worked at two IT firms in Bengaluru before doing freelance work. 
He was picked up by the Bengaluru police from his residence on February 18, 2008, and his arrest was recorded only on February 22. 
“I don’t know why I was framed.  They said I had taken part in a conspiracy at Hubli.  Perhaps they were acting according to a script.  First they made a case of terror and then fixed all of us,” he said on Monday. 
The 40-year-old said he had attended meetings of SIMI while doing pre-degree at Mohammed Abdurahiman Memorial Orphanage College, Manassery.  But that was before the outfit was proscribed. 
“Initially, the police tortured me for two days.  After that, I was in judicial custody.  But I had to endure the sufferings all these years for no reason.  Now the real facts are out,” he said.  Yahya said he had to rebuild his career from scratch.  “I am happy to be home with family, relatives, and friends,” he said.  He is married to Fareeda and has four children with her.  Monsoon sea merciless on Chellanam Residents in the coastal panchayat of Chellanam continues to take the brunt of a rough monsoon sea with scores of houses under threat of periodic flooding, especially along stretches where seawalls have been damaged or been flattened by the waves. 
Residents in Malakhappady, Companyppady, Ganapatikkadu and Kandakkadavu are the worst affected.  Seawalls have been seriously damaged and sea erosion is severe in these areas. 
However, seawall repair is held up as no contractor was coming forward to take up the works, said Dominic Presentation, MLA.  “I am helpless”, he said about the repair works being delayed.  He claimed that allegations of corruption by an individual in the panchayat against contractors had kept them away from the tenders floated for the works. 
Restriction on granite quarrying during the rainy months was one reason for the delay in repairs, he said.  However, the Chief Minister’s attention was drawn to the plight of the people and orders had now been issued to build breakwaters at Cheriyakadavu, Companyppady, Bazaar and Saudi-Manassery, he said. 
Panchayat member V.  T.  Antony from Maruvakkad said that of the more than 430 families in his ward, at least 300 faced threat of flooding, especially during the rainy months. 
Mr.  Antony claimed that a piece of repair work was tendered nine times and no one responded.  Work on 50 metres of seawall and retaining wall between Bazaar and Velankanni was about to begin now after a big lapse of time. 
A.  J.  Jakson at Alunkal Kadappuram whose house was flooded by the sea early this week said that nothing appeared to be moving on the seawall repair front. 
He pointed to the house of Biju Edamukkil, precariously perched on the edge of the waters and constantly being lashed by sea waves. 
Though people living close to the sea face constant threat, they are not in a position to move out of their homes as they have nowhere else to go, he said. 
K.  X.  George of Ganapathikkadu, who has made allegations of irregularities in the maintenance of the seawall across the district of Ernakulam, claims that the basic problem with seawall repairs was that stones of the right size were not being used.  Deft strokes on a compassionate canvas aricatures drawn by K. R.  Ramesh, a degree student from Koodaranhi, always kindles laughter among his friends. 
However, this time, his works featuring around 50 persons, including his teachers, non-teaching staff and some of the management committee members of his college, will serve a different purpose. 
The income generated from this artist’s initiative will come to the aid of Irfan, a seven-year-old boy from the Palakkuzhi Government Lower Primary School.  Irfan hailing from a poor family, has been undergoing treatment for blood cancer at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital. 
Of the 50 caricatures he made, most of them have already been sold out at the M. A. M. O campus at Manassery, where he pursues his final year B. Com course.   The total amount generated through this effort is now around Rs.50,000, which will be handed over to the boy’s family.  Additional fund sourced by Ramesh’s friends in various parts of the district and the college alumni association too is on its way to support Irfan’s treatment. 
Three-month work
“I couldn’t just ignore the appeal when it firstly appeared in the Whatsapp messenger seeking financial aid for Irfan.  Twice I met the boy before starting this three-month long caricature works featuring my teachers, non-teaching staff and others on the campus,” says Ramesh. 
“The boy needs at-least three years of continuous medication.  The amount we generated through the art work will be a big relief for the five-member family,” he adds. 
The base price Ramesh fixed for his caricature work is Rs.1,000.  “There were persons who contributed more than that as the intention was to help Irfan.  All of them had encouraged me much to go ahead with the attempt,” said Ramesh. 
M. V.  Brajila, Assistant Professor from the college, says there was a positive response towards Ramesh’s efforts to help Irfan.  “We mainly enlisted the cooperation of teaching and non-teaching staff as they would be able to contribute generously to the initiative.  Students too came up with voluntary contributions to support the cause,” she adds. 
The funds will be given to a
7-year-old boy undergoing treatment for blood cancer at Kozhikode Medical College Hospital.  Power supply Power supply will be regulated in the following areas in Ernakulam on Saturday and Sunday.

During the evidence gathering process, the police team also identified a lodge at Manassery where the accused stayed with his close aides for planning the theft.  It was found that the lodge owner granted accommodation to the man without checking his whereabouts and the identity proof.  He was served a notice seeking all the available details of persons who were recently granted accommodation in the lodge.  Openbill’s nesting spot brings joy to birders The spotting of large nesting places of Asian Openbill Stork, a large wading migratory bird, at Thirunavaya in Malappuram district has brought cheers to wildlife enthusiasts and bird watchers here as it was an indication of their peaceful breeding and growing population in the region. 
The Openbill Storks were considered very rare in the State until late 1970s.  Their population began to spread to more wetlands throughout the State since 1990s. 
However, it was only very rarely that their nesting places were spotted from anywhere in the State. 
According to Jafer Palot, a zoologist with the Kozhikode regional centre of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), The Hindu had in 2004 reported about a group of Thiruvananthapuram-based bird-watchers recording a nesting and breeding place of Openbill in a sacred grove near Shoranur in Palakkad district.  The report he says, had also claimed that to be the first ever citing of the bird’s nesting place from the State. 
25 nests
The new breeding spot at Thirunavaya was discovered by C. P.  Babu from Manassery, a known bird-watcher from the district.  According to Mr.  Babu, there were around 25 nests on top of a bunch of screw pines bordering a large stretch of lotus filled water body near the railway-track at Thirunavaya. 
The place is very hard to reach for human beings, says P. T.  Muhammed, wildlife photographer, who accompanied Mr.  Babu to record the citing.  “We had to wade through nearly a km in the waist-deep water to get them photographed,” says Mr.  Muhammed, who used a 500 mm telelens to zoom on them from about a km distance. 
The Asian Openbill stork is predominantly greyish white with glossy black wings and tail that has a green or purple sheen.  Their beak is reddish black with arching mandibles, which do not meet except at the tip, and gives the species its name in Malayalam Cheraa Kokkan (meaning, beaks which do not meet). 
Mentioned by Salim Ali
The bird, which has been mentioned by the renowned ornithologist Salim Ali in his book Birds of Kerala as a local migrant, had also been described in detail in the book ‘Birds of Kerala: status and distribution’ co-authored by a group of people including Dr.  Palot. 
“The new citing of the bird’s breeding spot is a really significant,” he says.  Power shutdown Power supply will be regulated on Tuesday between 9 a. m.  and 5 p. m.  to the following places — Girinagar section: Gandhinagar Residence Park, EWF, LIG Kaloor Section: Canopy Building, St.  Martins Road, Puthanpurakkal Road, North janatha Junction; Vyttila section: Poonithura Palace premises and Poonithura road, Fort Kochi section: Manassery, Mother Theressa road, Fishermen Colony, Saudi Pally, Thommassery.

Thiruvakkarai,"Weekend Wander Residents of Chennai are currently enjoying weather that is on its best behaviour.  Chilly mornings give way to bright sunny days, and breezy evenings.  Starting around Deepavali - when the city's skyscape and weather becomes more pleasant - and through Christmas, there are plenty of holidays in store, with New Year's Eve followed by Pongal. 
This is probably the best time for residents to take a breather from the milling crowds and enjoy a holiday in the hills, or a family picnic at a seaside resort or at a dam.  Contrary to the popular perception that holidayers have to travel overnight to hill stations like Ooty and Kodaikanal, there are lovely places closer to Chennai that one, leaving after sunrise, can reach shortly after breakfast. 
Make the best of the extended weekend and the holidays this festival season, and head to getaway spots just a few hours drive away from Chennai.  There are hill stations, lagoons, mangrove forests, springs and waterfalls, parks and lush green meadows not very far from the city.  Here, we present a few places where a day can be spent and other locations that require a couple of days of travel.  Most of the places listed here are well connected by train and buses.  For people travelling by personal transport, it is easier, with the option of visiting other interesting locations on the way
Ginjee fort–Sathanur dam: (Distance: 155 kms)
Located 160 kilometres from the city, one of the most popular destinations in Villupuram district is Ginjee fort.  The massive, awe-inspiring facade of the fort is at the same time beautiful.  Not very far away from Ginjee, is Sathanur dam in Tiruvannamalai district. 
The dam, built across Pennaiyar river, is a delight for children, and an ideal picnic spot for families.  There is a crocodile farm on the dam.  There are buses throughout the day to Tindivanam and Villupuram, from where travellers can hop onto connecting buses.  There are a good number of hotels offering decent accommodation and quality food in Tindivanam, Villupuram and Tiruvannamalai. 
Yelagiri – Jamunamarathur – Jalagamparai: (Distance: 220 kms)
Yelagiri in Vellore district is experienced at its best between monsoon and the onset of summer.  There is a children’s park, a boathouse and a garden, where families can spend a delightful evening.  Do not forget to buy the hill produce — honey, herbs and spices—- procured and sold by government-authorised women self-help groups.  The Jalagamparai waterfalls are located near Thirupathur in the district, and are worth a visit.  Travellers should not miss the piping hot kuzhi puniyaram served with spicy chutneys. 
The Beeman falls in Jamunamarathur is probably the best kept secret of Tiruvannamalai district.  It can be reached from Vaniyambadi, from where the ascent begins, passing through Kavalur observatory and Alangayam.  There are hotels in Yelagiri, and one can also find accommodation in Vellore or Thirupathur. 
Tada falls – Pulicat: (Distance: 70 kms)
If you are looking to trek in a serene environment, the Tada or Ubbalamadugu falls, across the border in neighbouring Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, is the ideal choice.  A two-and-a-half-hour drive on NH5 towards Tada leads to Varadaiahpalem.  After Gummidipoondi, mango orchards and green fields dot the sides of the highway, before the turn into Varadaiahpalem. 
Ubbalamadugu is another six km away.  One has to trek a few kilometres to reach the crystal-clear waterfalls.  The Nagala and Koney falls, all situated on the Tamil Nadu–Andhra Pradesh border are also must-visits.  Pulicat in Tiruvallur district is a visual treat for travellers, especially bird-lovers.  Thousands of birds arrive here between October and March.  The brackish water lagoon here is dotted with a number of villages. 
Hogenakkal: (Distance: 330 kms)
Best known as the place where Cauvery enters Tamil Nadu from Karnataka, the river passes through gorges-like rock formations.  The drive through Pennagaram to Hogenakkal is a mesmerising experience, though slightly risky for those uninitiated in driving on hill roads. 
Tourists can reach early in the morning and purchase provisions and food, including fresh fish caught in the river.  Cooks can be hired to prepare meals, be it for a small group or big gathering.  In the meantime, you can hire coracles for the famous swirling rides in the Cauvery and land on the small river islands for an oil massage.  There are direct buses to Hogenakkal from Koyambedu, and plenty of accommodation on offer. 
Horsley hills: (Distance: 270 kms)
Cruising from Chennai city towards west for nearly six hours can take you to what seems like paradise.  Horsley hills, known as the Ooty of Andhra Pradesh, will surely be a soothing experience for travellers who want to spend a memorable weekend.  A little over 250 kilometres from Chennai, the scenic hill resort with views of misty mountains guarantees a relaxed time and, for those who enjoy a trek, moments of adventure. 
Make sure you book your stay at Horsley hills in advance, as weekends can be crowded, especially during the holidays, with people from nearby towns and cities flocking to enjoy the nippy weather.  For motorcycle riders, a trip through the rough terrain could prove a challenging and enjoyable experience.  In addition to private accommodation, the Andhra Pradesh tourism department runs a property for rent. 
Puducherry: (Distance: 160 kms)
A scenic drive down East Coast Road leads to the idyllic town of Puducherry.  For people who do not want to spend the entire weekend exploring the beaches of Puducherry and Auroville, there are places such as Oussudu bird sanctuary (Ousteri) to visit outside the town.  For heritage-lovers, a walk with INTACH around Puducherry, followed by a trip to Thiruvakkarai’s National Fossil Wood Park, around 30 km away, is a good option.  The Pitchavaram mangrove forest is a two-hour drive away, and is home to a number of exotic bird species.  You can also plan a trip to Cuddalore’s Silver Beach, or even a ride down to Chidambaram to visit the Nataraja Temple.  People driving down ECR should not miss a meal at the shacks in Vennangupattu.  Excavation in Auroville throws up Iron Age artefacts Burial sites, possibly dating back to the Iron Age, were unearthed during an archaeological excavation programme in Auroville. 
The artefacts found beneath granite slabs in urns include cups, vessels, cowbells made of bronze, beads and semi precious stone lapis lazuli.  Iron objects such as swords, spades, spears, sickle and axe were also found. 
According to archaeologist and assistant professor from Tagore Arts College Ravichandran, who has been leading the excavation, assisted by field supervisor Gopinathan and volunteers from the college, the three burial sites found are secondary ones and only partial remains could be found in such sites. 
The depth of the site is around three to four meters and 10 to 15 meters in diameter.  The cairn circle in the centre is made with limestones transported from Royapudupakkam and granite slabs from Thiruvakkarai, a few kilometres from the site. 
The team has been making several similar finds over the past two years in Auroville.  The excavation programme, which concentrated on an area very close to the Matrimandir, was aimed at finding evidence of a trading link between the ancient port city of Arikamedu and the site inside Auroville. 
“The significance of the excavations is in that they establish a once flourishing internal trade and commerce even before the Roman and Greek period,” Mr.  Ravichandran said. 
He surmises that the language used must have been Tamil but no evidence has been found so far.  Only graffiti marks can be found on the outer surface of the pottery.  According to the findings, the settlement must have been a cattle-rearing community and they must have had trade with Arikamedu. 
The site was first accidentally discovered by the locals while taking soil for Pongal celebrations.  Initially, it took time to get permission from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).  Surveys conducted around Puducherry and Auroville revealed Medieval Age and Stone Age materials. 
Gilbert Lachaux, an Auroville resident, recalls finding a granite slab about 60 cm below the ground level while digging holes to plant trees 30 years ago. 
The excavation is funded by the Auroville Foundation.  The team is collaborating with the Tamil Sembulam, a part of the Tamil Heritage Foundation (THF) for archaeological purposes. 
It is supposed to go on till September, depending on the availability of funds. 
“There is an immediate need to protect the site from being destroyed like Perambai near the Ousteri Lake, which was ruined by mineral excavation.  India has several archaeological sites that are not preserved and shares the same fate as Perambai,” said Mr.  Ravichandran. 
In the near future, the site will be turned into an archaeological park where the architecture can be studied and the excavated items will soon be exhibited in a museum at Bharathi Nivas in Auroville.

He surmises that the language used must have been Tamil but no evidence has been found so far.  Only graffiti marks can be found on the outer surface of the pottery.  According to the findings, the settlement must have been a cattle-rearing community and they must have had trade with Arikamedu. 
The site was first accidentally discovered by the locals while taking soil for Pongal celebrations.  Initially, it took time to get permission from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).  Surveys conducted around Puducherry and Auroville revealed Medieval Age and Stone Age materials. 
Gilbert Lachaux, an Auroville resident, recalls finding a granite slab about 60 cm below the ground level while digging holes to plant trees 30 years ago. 
The excavation is funded by the Auroville Foundation.  The team is collaborating with the Tamil Sembulam, a part of the Tamil Heritage Foundation (THF) for archaeological purposes. 
It is supposed to go on till September, depending on the availability of funds. 
“There is an immediate need to protect the site from being destroyed like Perambai near the Ousteri Lake, which was ruined by mineral excavation.  India has several archaeological sites that are not preserved and shares the same fate as Perambai,” said Mr.  Ravichandran. 
In the near future, the site will be turned into an archaeological park where the architecture can be studied and the excavated items will soon be exhibited in a museum at Bharathi Nivas in Auroville.  A ‘new’ fossil tree trunk at Ooty botanical garden The Botanical Garden at Udhagamandalam got a new fossil tree trunk in place of the fossil tree trunk that was in place for more than three decades. 
It is said that the old fossil tree trunk from the National Fossil Park at Thiruvakkarai in Villupuram district was given to the botanical garden here in the year 1978 by the Geological Survey of India (GSI).  Joint Director of Horticulture N.  Mani said that replacement of the old fossil tree trunk was necessitated due to moss growth on the old fossil tree. 
India map
The Horticulture Department requested GSI to replace the old fossil tree and the new one was installed opposite the India map near the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation canteen and opened to the public from Saturday .  The fossil tree trunk is a tourist favourite and almost all of them have take a photograph of themselves along with the tree that existed about 20 million years ago. 
According to GSI, the old fossil tree and new one are 20 million-year-old trees that have turned into rocks. 
Inland lakes
Description of the fossil at the garden states that trees carried by rivers and deposited in inland lakes gradually transformed into fossils. 
More such treasures could be seen at the National Fossil Park at Thiruvakkarai in Villupuram. 
Additional Director of the botanical garden Umarani said that the old fossil tree continues to remain in the park and can be seen by the public over the next few days, before it’s future is decided by the senior horticulture and GSI officials, she said.

Maneybhanjyang,"Chill skips Kolkata but Hills gets snow  DARJEELING/KOLKATA: The winter chill kept eluding Kolkata, even as Sandakphu received heavy snowfall on Thursday. 
Kolkata’s temperature had gone up to 21C last week and on Thursday it went up to 25C.  The night temperature at 13.7C was normal.  The Met office does not expect the mercury to dip further immediately. 
“The night temperature will hover around the 14°C mark, while the day temperature will be around 25°C in the next few days,” said a source at the Regional Meteorological Centre. 
On the other hand, Sandakphu, 60km from Darjeeling town, received 4-5 inches of snow on Thursday.  Sandhakphu, the topmost point of Darjeeling at 3,636m, received heavy snowfall for almost an hour.  Officials of the tourist lodges owned by Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) could not be contacted, but drivers of the Manyeybhanjyang-Sandakphu route confirmed that it snowed for about an hour from 3.30 to 4.30pm. 
“Some of my fellow drivers who had taken a group of tourists to Sandakphu returned after going half of the way because of 4-5 inches of snow.  Some tourists walked down to Maneybhanjyang, which is the starting point towards Sandakphu,” said Chandan Pradhan, general secretary of the Singalila Landrover Association. 
In Darjeeling town, however, the situation was different.  Although the sky was clear in the morning, the weather turned chilly and clouds gathered overhead in the afternoon.  Around 3.50pm, a drizzle sparked anticipation of snowfall.  The anticipation however died just as fast since the rain subsided within five minutes, leaving the streets covered in slush.  Hope of snow on Tiger Hill at 2,560m, which normally receives snow, also faded. 
“The temperature in Tiger Hill is around 3-4 degrees, which is not conducive for snowfall.  But it could snow late in the evening or in the night.  Some tourists were here but had to go back disappointed,” said Pradip Lama, the Pavilion manager of Tiger Hill. 
Rashik Garg from Bangalore, who arrived in Darjeeling on Wednesday, said “I was looking forward to snowfall as my hotel manager had said that it could snow anytime because of the weather condition prevailing over the week.  I was ready to rush to Tiger Hill if it snowed.  The drizzle in the afternoon gave some hope but it faded with the sun that came out five minutes later. ”
It had snowed in Sandakphu even a week back, but had failed to accumulate.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  West Bengal: GNLF supporters assaulted for abusing Bimal Gurung DARJEELING: Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) supporters blocked NH-55 near Ghoom station in Darjeeling in protest against the assault on them allegedly by cadre of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), the police said today. 
Acknowledging the receipt a complaint against GJM cadre, Superintendent of Police of Darjeeling Akhilesh Chaturvedi said, "" There was a confrontation between GNLF and GJM supporters at Ghoom yesterday.  We have assured the complainants of arresting those involved in the assault. "" 
The incident took place around 3:30 pm when GNLF supporters were returning home after attending the death ritual of their party founder Subash Ghisingh, he said. 
The police said that the clash broke out when some GNLF supporters allegedly started to abuse GJM president Bimal Gurung who was returning home to Darjeeling from Maneybhanjyang. 
Subash Ghisingh died on January 29 in a Delhi hospital and was cremated in his ancestral home in Mirik.  As per Buddhist custom, his death ritual was held yesterday at his residence in Darjeeling after 21 days of his death.  GJM demands enhanced security for GTA chief Bimal Gurung DARJEELING (WB): The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has asked the Superintendent of Police, Darjeeling Hills, to enhance the security cover for GTA Chief Executive Bimal Gurung whose rank is on par with a state cabinet minister and condemned the alleged attack on his convoy two days back. 
The memorandum, signed by GJM General Secretary Roshan Giri, alleged the convoy of GTA Chief Executive was "" waylaid near Ghoom station by GNLF supporters who were drunk.  They abused the GTA Chief Executive and even tried to assault him"" . 
The memorandum was submitted yesterday.  Wednesday's incident took place when GNLF supporters were on their way back from Darjeeling after attending the death rituals of Subash Ghisingh while the GTA Chief Executive was on his way to Darjeeling town from Maneybhanjyang after laying the foundation stone for a road project, Giri said. 
Additional SP Surya Pratap Yadav said a probe is on to ascertain what happened in Ghoom. 
"" As for the GJM's demand for more security to the GTA chief executive, we will first review the situation,""  the ASP said. 
"" We demand the immediate arrest of the GNLF cadre who attacked our President.  If they are not arrested within 24 hours, we will launch a bigger agitation,""  GJM Assistant Secretary Binay Tamang said. 
"" The district administration and the police were both aware of Gurung's itinerary for the day.  The district police are responsible for ensuring proper security arrangements to enable the GTA chief executive to move freely, especially when a rival political party is holding a rally or function,""  Giri said after submitting the memorandum. 
The GNLF had called a strike in Pokhraybong on Thursday,demanding the arrest of the GJM cadre responsible for the alleged assault. 
It was called off after three GJM supporters, allegedly involved in the incident, were arrested. 
The three - identified as local residents Nikit Rai, Abit Rai, and Dharmadhoj Tamang - were produced before the chief judicial magistrate court yesterday and granted bail. 
Rubbishing GJM charges, the GNLF earlier said its supporters were assaulted by morcha men accompanying Gurung's convoy when the GNLF activists were returning home after attending the death ritual of GNLF founder Subash Ghisingh and the two sides came face to face. 
Gurung currently is entitled to have a security cover comprising an assistant sub-inspector and six constables round the clock, GTA sources said.

Lingambudhi Lake,"Lingambudhi Lake to be conserved as biodiversity hotspot The Lingambudhi Lake,a major bird habitat in the city, is set to see better days as the Forest Department proposes to develop it on the lines of the Karanji Nature Park and conserve it as a biodiversity hotspot.  In addition, the Malalvadi Kere near Jayanagar would also be beautified providing the much-needed lung space for the people in the area. 
A detailed project report has been submitted to the authorities concerned with a request to sanction Rs.  2 crore for each of the lakes. 
At Lingambudhi, the existing lake embankment will be strengthened and silt will be removed.  Besides, the bird islands would be strengthened besides planting locally endemic tree saplings. 
Deputy Conservator of Forests V.  Karikalan told The Hindu that the project details have been submitted to the higher authorities in Bengaluru who have promised to release funds this year. 
However, Lingamubhi Lake has a problem of untreated sewage being let to flow into it thus posing a major threat to its ecological integrity.  Hence the Forest Department has urged the Mysuru City Corporation and the Mysore Urban Development Authority to establish a sewage treatment plant there. 
“We have been telling the two local bodies to expedite the works but nothing has happened so far and hence the Forest Department is contemplating on outsourcing the construction of sewage treatment plant to private players”, said Mr.  Karikalan. 
Preventing untreated sewage from entering the lake is a must for its long-term conservation.  Lingamubdhi Lake is a major watershed and is full to the brim during the monsoon, and more than 3000 birds of nearly 200 species – both migratory and local- come to roost here during winter.  There is also a mantapa at the lake foreshore which would be renovated, Mr.  Karikalan said. 
Mr.  Karikalan said Lingambudhi had as much potential as the Karanji Nature Park if not more and could be turned around to harbour local biodiversity.  Spread over nearly 220 acres with a water spread of about 160 acres, Lingambudhi Lake has a history of citizen’s participation in its conservation.  When the alignment of the Outer Ring Road was laid across the lake, it resulted in widespread protest following which the road alignment was changed and the lake was saved. 
The lake has a catchment area of 40 sq.  The Malalvadi Kere in Jayanagar will be converted into an eco-park with walking path, island and a bridge.  About 250 tree saplings have been planted but there is no fresh water inflow into the lake, and hence rainwater would be harvested.  Mobile tankers to be stationed at various spots for idol immersion The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) will operate mobile water tankers in the city to facilitate the immersion of idols in an environment-friendly manner. 
Three vehicles will be stationed at different places at specified times from September 17 to 20, according to the KSPCB.  Vehicle number 1 will be stationed close to Metagalli Police Station from 4 p. m.  to 5.15 p. m; near K. D. Circle at Vijaynagar 2{+n}{+d}stage from 5.30 p. m.  to 6.45 p. m; close to Chandramouleshwara Temple and Matrhu Mandali Circle at Vontikoppal from 7 p. m.  to 8.15 p. m; near Kukkarahalli main entrance from 8.30 p. m.  to 10.30 p. m.  The contact number of the vehicle in-charge is 9880164745. 
Vehicle number 2 will be positioned near Vikram Hospital at Yadavgiri from 4 p. m.  to 5.15 p. m; near Shantala theatre from 5.30 p. m.  to 6.45 . p. m. , at Chamundi Circle from 7 p. m.  to 8.15 p. m.  and near the main entrance of the Karanji Lake from 8.30 p. m.  to 10.30 p. m.  Contact number of the vehicle in-charge is 9900479002
The third vehicle will be near Jayamma Govinde Gowda Kalyana Mantapa at Kuvempunagar from 4 p. m.  to 5.15 p. m. ; near Jayanagar Raiway Gate from 5.30 p. m.  to 6.45 p. m. , near J. P.  Nagar Gobbali Mara Bus Stand from 7 p. m.  to 8.15 p. m.  and near the main entrance of Lingambudhi Lake from 8.30 p. m.  to 10.30 p. m. 
The contact number of the vehicle in-charge is 9845307419. 
The mobile tankers have been introduced to discourage people from polluting lakes and other waterbodies during the immersion process.

Vitthal Ramji Shinde Bridge,"MANS activists want probe into Dabholkar's death intensified  PUNE: Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS) on Sunday resolved to intensify its demand for a thorough probe into the Narendra Dabholkar murder case in order to nab the killers at the earliest.  At the end of the three-day convention, MANS activists decided to launch a series of activities so that the state and central government would be compelled to speed up the probe.  Dabholkar was shot dead by two unidentified men on Vitthal Ramji Shinde Bridge near Balgandharva Rangmandir on August 20, 2013.  "" We have started a campaign against violence and we plan to send one lakh post-cards to the President of India seeking to know when Dabholkar's murderers would be nabbed,""  said Avinash Patil, executive president of MANS, while addressing the concluding session of the convention.  He added that MANS will take up the matter at every appropriate forum in order to expedite the probe.  On Sunday morning, MANS workers marched from Swargate to Vitthal Ramji Shinde Bridge demanding that Dabholkar's murderers must be nabbed without further delay.  As the rally reached the spot where Dabholkar was murdered, MANS leaders addressed a meeting and resolved to continue the fight for justice.  In the concluding session, Dabholkar's wife Shaila said that MANS workers must be proud that they are members of an organisation that is fighting to imbibe rationalism among common people.  "" All of us have become like Dabholkar and we have to take his work forward,""  she said, adding that the huge response to the three-day conference was evidence that his work would continue, despite all hurdles.  Veteran activist Vidya Bal also participated in the concluding session.  She said that rationalist movements need to be more alert now since fundamental forces are gaining strength.  Communist leader Bhalchandra Kango mentioned that it is time for all progressive and rational movements to become more vigilant about mainstream politics so as to strengthen progressive political parties.  Senior scientist Jayant Narlikar, scholar A H Salunkhe, Datta Desai and others were also present at the convention. The written word finds many takers Organisers of the MANS convention said that, in the course of three days, books worth Rs 6 lakh were sold.  Tomes on subjects such as rationalism, superstition, Buddhism, women's movement and Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal were picked up in big number.  A booklet, titled Shivaji Kon Hota written by late Govind Pansare, was also in demand at the convention.  Shaila Dabholkar, the slain activist's wife, said that reading would strengthen rational thinking and MANS workers must engage in readings and discussions.  Veteran activist Vidya Bal added that reading enhances rationality. Corpus fund set up MANS has decided to raise a corpus fund in memory of Narendra Dabholkar.  The fund will be utilised to take the organisation's mission forward.  MANS workers and activists have contributed Rs 3 lakh towards the fund till date.  Volunteers from the organisation mentioned that people from various fields, medical practitioners, teachers, daily wage labourers and students, have been contributing to the fund.

State govt lacks will to arrest killers, say activists, leaders  PUNE: The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS) activists, leaders and workers on Thursday expressed apprehensions over the state government's will to probe into murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and arrest his killers and the mastermind behind it. 
MANS and other organizations marked the day with a rally that started from Vitthal Ramji Shinde Bridge, where he was killed in 2013 and continued at Manohar Mangal Karyala near Mhatre Bridge. 
State president of MANS and veteran leader N D Patil said, "" I doubt if politicians really want to probe into the murder cases of Dabholkar and Govind Pansare.  Be it the Congress-NCP government or the current BJP-led government, the approach is same.  They don't want to go into the roots of the case. ""  It is hard to believe that the police force is completely in the dark about the killers,""  he said.  Congress party's Rajya Sabha MP Husain Dalwai said, "" I am sorry that the Congress government in Maharashtra could not arrest Dabholkar's murderers.  I don't know about my party's stand, but I am with MANS.  It is not that police are inefficient, but they are unwilling to probe into the case. ""  He also criticized former state home minister and NCP leader late R R Patil saying that the latter was not efficient enough to take a tough stand. 
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Subhash Ware said, "" The government is not interested in the probe as they know where it will lead. "" 
Avinash Patil, state executive president of MANS said, "" We know we are being ignored, but we will continue to fight using constitutional methods. "" 
Various speakers supported FTII students and accused the government of suppressing students by using police force.  Well-known Marathi film and theatre personalities including National Award winners Nagnath Manjule, Girish Kulkarni, actor Jitendra Joshi, Sonali Kulkarni, Kishor Kadam, Sunil Sukthankar, Sumitra Bhave and Atul Pethe came out in support of MANS.

Shanmugam. 
On July 25 (Saturday)
There will be a power shutdown, due to monthly maintenance works at Chekkanoorani substation on July 25 (Saturday) from 9 a. m.  to 2 p. m. , in the following areas: Chekkanoorani, K.  Puliankulam, Panniyaan, Kinnimangalam, Mavilipatti, Moonandipatti, A.  Kokkulam, Karumathur, Kannanur, Sakkilipatti, Kovilankulam, Poochampatti, Jothimanickam, Vadapalanchi, Thenpalanchi and Palkalai Nagar areas, Executive Engineer M.  Ilango said in a press release issued here.  One more green initiative from Madurai blossoms For M.  Elango of Navarathinapuram, a third generation entrepreneur, dyeing and bleaching of fabrics is a business learnt hard, the traditional way.  Like him, hundreds of dyers and bleachers involved in micro and small businesses were hitherto not aware of the impact of their vocation on the environment, especially groundwater table, of Madurai.  They have been following crude manual methods without knowing how to dispose of the effluents. 
When the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) cracked the whip, insisting on zero discharge of effluents, the only option was to shut down shop.  This compulsion resulted in the birth of Southern Districts Textile Processing Cluster Private Limited (SDTPC), a special purpose vehicle floated by 36 units, for the promotion of a common facility with zero liquid discharge technology, claimed to be the first of its kind in the State. 
The common effluent treatment plant (CETP), to be constructed under the Union government’s Integrated Processing Development Scheme, will become operational at Pottakulam and Tamaraikulam in Kariapatti taluk of neighbouring Virudhunagar district with an investment of Rs.  167.3 crore by this time next year.  It will come up at an industrial estate to be created under the Private Industrial Estate Scheme of the State government over an area of 100 acres. 
For three districts
The CETP will cater to the needs of dyeing and bleaching units of Madurai, Sivaganga and Virudhunagar districts and can even perform outsourced work for Tirupur, Coimbatore and Erode.  It will even facilitate migration of textile processing units elsewhere in the State to south Tamil Nadu, says KR.  Gnanasambandan, consultant. 
Explaining Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) Technology to be adopted in the CETP, the Managing Director of SDTPC, Ritan N.  Thakker, says that it will enable recovery of 90 per cent of water from effluents for reuse by units.  It will also recover used salts and provide them for reuse.  The technology conforms to Euro Standard and it will increase export potential.  A team from IKOS, France, led by Christophe, its Director, International, visited the site for the industrial estate recently and expressed its satisfaction.  A similar plant in Surat of Gujarat employs marine discharge of effluents by reducing their TDS and decolouring. 
To start with, 36 units attached to the SDTPC will shift to the industrial estate by providing direct employment to 60 to 70 persons per unit.  They will process textiles for bigger units in Tirupur, Rajapalayam, Aruppukottai and Madurai.  The CETP will be self-sufficient on the power front with a co-generation facility.  Its low processing cost is expected to give this green initiative a competitive edge over similar facilities spread across the country.

Bheemsamudra Road,"Rs 1.5 Though sufficient quantity of drinking water is supplied to Chitradurga from Shanti Sagar, it is not reaching people owing to major leakages at more than nine points in the pipeline and technical snags at the machines in treatment plants. 
So the City Municipal Council is in the final stages of preparing a plan of Rs 1.5 crore to install new pipelines and rectify the loopholes in the treatment plant. 
According to City Municipal Council President B.  Kantraj drinking water is supplied to Chitradurga, Holalkere, Jagalur Town Panchayat and 22 villages from Shanti Sagar. 
Though the project is of 40 MLD capacities, major portion of the water is wasted owing to leakages in the pipelines. 
In a joint survey, conducted by officers of the City Municipal Council and the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Board Engineers, most of the water is wasted at leakages at Bheemsamudra Road, Haliyur railway gate, Hireguntnur, Hirekandwadi treatment plant owing to improper maintenance and low-quality work. 
In view of the people’s plight, the municipal council is preparing a plan to replace old pipelines and install new equipment at the treatment plants to ensure sufficient and safe drinking water to people. 
Work on the same would be started in next few months after completing the tender process. 
“Since the supply of drinking water would be affected during the project work, the council is planning to make alternate arrangements to supply water to city and a final decision in this regard would be taken shortly.  Once the project is completed, there will be no problem in supplying ample quantity of water to people in the city,” he added. 
Flouride
Since there are complaints about high fluoride content in water in some parts of the city, the council had already taken steps to install drinking water purification units at different places to ensure safe drinking water to the poor and middle class people who cannot afford RO plants at their houses.  There are also plans to install such plants at all places where there are complaints in the city in phased manner, he added.

Palluruthy Veli,"Kochi gets ready to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr  KOCHI: Marking the end of month-long Ramzan fasting, believers in the city will celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr on Saturday with fervor, festivities and huge feasts. 
As the Muslim community gets ready to celebrate Eid, the Hindu community will begin observing âKarkidakamâ, the month of austerity. 
âEid is more like a huge family reunion.  My relatives from Kasaragod and Kozhikode are in town for the weekend.  Preparations for the feast have already begun.  My mother makes biriyani, payasam and her specialty, haleem, at home every year.  The process starts a day in advance.  Itâs going to be a big feast,â said Samah Mariam, a resident of Panampilly Nagar. 
Eid prayers will be held at eidgahs (open air spaces) and mosques across the city, including St Albert's College Ground, Marine Drive, Perumbavoor Municipal Stadium, Aluva Nochima, Parade Ground in Fort Kochi, Malipuram Maidan in Vypeen, and Palluruthy Veli ground among others. 
Meanwhile, prices of meat remained more or less stable through the month, according to vendors.  George Edathil, president of Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association, said the price of chicken went up by Rs 10 over the last two weeks.  The price now stands at Rs 120 per kg in the city.  The price of beef has been varying between Rs 260 and Rs 280, while that of mutton stood at Rs 450.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  On a floral note of protest : When authorities turned a deaf ear to their protest against the reported reluctance of the civic authorities to remove garbage from the collection point near the Palluruthy Government UP School, local residents decided to take matters into their own hands.  Instead of raising decibel levels to show their protest, they discovered a novel way to get the attention of the authorities. 
After the putrefying refuse remained at the spot for close to 10 days, people decided not to allow the collection of garbage from there any more, said Mumtaz, the Corporation Councillor representing the area in the council.  The people got together and set up a garden there to avoid dumping of garbage in the area. 
It was also the case with some other areas in the west Kochi region. 
Though the civic authorities claimed that two trucks were allotted for collecting the refuse from west Kochi region daily, the removal of garbage has never been smooth, she alleged. 
The health issues posed by the irregular collection and removal of decaying refuse were repeatedly brought to the attention of the civic authorities at the Corporation council meetings.  Yet, no one acted on the complaint, said Ms.  Mumtaz, who had raised the issue at the Corporation council meeting last week also. 
She complained that officials of the Health wing of the Kochi Corporation were not keen in attending to the complaints of the general public.  Some of the officials were also irregular to the office thereby crippling the public health activities, she said. 
After ending the collection of garbage at one point, it has been decided to collect it at three different points in the region.  Decentralised collection and transportation of the refuse started on Monday.  The new collection points thus identified were at Palluruthy Veli near Kochi Corporation office, Madhura Company road and near Pashnithodu bridge, she said. 
Responding to the developments, T. K.  Ashraf, chairman of the Health Standing Committee of the Kochi Corporation, said the collection of garbage from the region was disrupted on one day as the Kudumbashree workers didn’t turn up on the day.

Blood donation camps held to help thalassemia patients in Hyderabad  HYDERABAD: While many were out on the streets celebrating Milad-un-Nabi, the birth anniversary of the Prophet Muhammad, socio-religious organizations busied themselves with philanthropic activity, urging people to donate blood for a cause.  According to the organisers of the donation drive, as many as 2,800 units of blood were donated by around 3,000 people at various places across the twin cities. 
“We wanted to help those who have poor health.  That is why we began our drive to help patients suffering from thalassemia, a blood disorder,” said Sunni United Forum of Indian (SUFI) and former AP State Wakf Board member Syed Zaheeruddin Soofi, while speaking to TOI, on Monday. 
Organised by Forum for Cultural Upgradation and Social Service (FOCUS), Irshad ul Muslimeen and other organisations, the blood donation camps were held at the State Central Library (SCL) in Afzalgunj and Balamrai Eidgah in Secunderabad. 
“We collected 639 units at the SCL and around 440 at Balamrai Eidgah alone.  We estimate that over 1,200 donors arrived at the camp,” said Ahsan bin Mohammed al Hamooni, secretary of FOCUS and imam of the Shahi Mosque in Public Gardens.  The blood is being sent to various hospitals and blood banks, al Hamoomi added.  “We have sent it to Gandhi hospital, Durgabhai Deshmukh Hospital, Nilofer Hospital and Aarohi Blood Bank.  As we wanted to help thalassemia patients, we roped in the Thalassimia and Sickle Cell Society (TSCS) too, which is based in Purani Haveli in the Old City,” he said. 
Another blood donation camp at Quadri Chaman near Falaknuma was organised by SUFI where 936 units were collected.  “The blood will be given to Esra Hospital, Owaisi Hospital and the TSCS,” Soofi said. 
Further, around 50 units were collected at the Charminar Bus Station camp and 13 at Mahmoodguda. 
“The reason why organisers came forward to help TSCS is because thalassemia patients are not covered under the Aaryogyasri scheme that provides healthcare benefits to those who cannot afford it.  We have made several representations to the government to recognise this disorder and are hopeful that our efforts will bear fruit,” said TSCS joint secretary, Aleem Baig, father of two thalassemic daughters.

Two held for assaulting OGH surgeon  HYDERABAD: Police arrested two foreigners from Sudan and Saudi Arabia for assaulting a house surgeon at Osmania General Hospital (OGH) on Tuesday.

Vehicles diverted in Old City to ease traffic congestion  HYDERABAD: In a bid to ease traffic congestion in Old City, police on Wednesday diverted vehicles moving from Madina to Nayapul towards the high court road on the left.  The move is being taken up on an “experimental basis”, cops said. 
According to sources, commuters were caught unawares when they found the new traffic diversions.  Those who wished to go towards Afzalgunj had to take the HC road and travel to City College.  From here, they had to take a right towards Nayapul and then to Afzalgunj. 
Locals and businessmen from Pathergatti and Madina said that while the move may have increased travel time by a few minutes and the commute by a kilometre or so, it did in fact ease the congestion. 
“Autos in Old City usually contribute to traffic congestion to a great extent.  The auto drivers park according to their whims and fancies and efforts to have them move the vehicles often yielded no result.  At least now, there seems to be a breathing space,” a trader, who did not wish to be identified, said. 
Traffic cops said that the diversions were likely to stay for at least a couple of days more.  “Movements of vehicles are being studied.  It will take two or three days to completely understand the issue.  It is quite likely that the diversion will continue tomorrow as well,” a cop said. 
The traffic police earlier, had barred the entry of autos from Gulzar Houz to Charminar in a similar effort to ease congestion on roads.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Wakf board yet to reinstate suspended mutawallis  HYDERABAD: Inspite of a high court order, asking authorities to reinstate suspended mutawallis (managers of wakf institutions), including Syed Akbar Nizamuddin Hussaini and Mir Sharfuddin, the wakf board is yet to take any appropriate action. 
In fact, the inquiry report of APSWB investigation officer Mohammed Ahmed Ali, who is the fourth officer to probe the case, absolved former Dargah Hazrat Shah Khamosh mutawalli Syed Akbar Nizamuddin Hussaini of all charges. 
The charges levelled against him by the APSWB included allegedly failing to protect 865.37 acres in various parts of the city such as Maqata Sultanpur, Sabir Gulshan, along the Ring Road and Maqta Hassan Baig.  The other charges included alleged mismanagement of land parcels in Khanajiguda, Maqta Sultanpur and Ehata-e-Ameer Ali in Afzalgunj.  Further, the board also charged Nizamuddin with violating the mansha-e-wakf (purpose of endowment) of Sabir Gulsha spread over around 10 acres near the Ring Road. 
In the report, a copy of which is in TOIâs possession states that there is a disconnect between the documents provided by the complainants and the nature of land.  Finding that the charges could not be proved, inquiry officer Ali said, âThe documents (provided by the complainants) clearly reflect that the maqtas have not been incorporated in the Muntaqab No 360 while republishing the same in the official gazette.  As such, the very title of the maqtas is under cloud (sic). â On several occasions, they also noted that witnesses, including the complainants, had failed to establish facts during cross examination. 
Further, he concluded: âIn view of the oral and documentary evidence charges levelled against the respondent (Akbar Nizamuddin Hussaini) are not proved but on the other hand are found baseless.  Hence, I request to reinstate the respondent as mutawalli of the subject institutions by revoking his suspension. â
In another case, that of the suspension of Mir Sharfuddin Khan Charitable and Religious Trust mutawalli Mir Sharfuddin, the court issued a similar order.  According to Sharfuddinâs counsel Khaja Moizuddin, the court directed the APSWB to act on the inquiry reports which absolved Sharfuddin. 
âIn the case of my client, the court on June 16 has directed the APSWB to take steps according to the inquiry report, which was submitted to the board last February, within two weeks.  So far the board has not acted,â Moizuddin said.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  AP Dental Council accused of fund misappropriation  HYDERABAD: A year after bifurcation, division of funds of various regulatory bodies is still posing problems, and the latest to take centrestage is the alleged misappropriation of funds by the AP Dental council -- the body empowered to regulate the profession of dentistry under the Indian Dentist Act.  The council represents over 18,000 dentists in the two Telugu states. 
The suspicion of fund misappropriation by the council stems from the fact that it had no formally-elected board since 2000 when the tenure of outgoing president Dr K Mahendernath Reddy expired, say members of the Telangana Dentists' Association (TDA). 
"" Since 2000, there is no elected body in the AP Dental Council.  So, nobody knows what's actually happening to the one-time registration fees and annual renewal fees being collected from an estimated 10,000 dentists in Telangana.  Since the body has been functioning for more than 40 years, we want the funds belonging to Telangana dentists to be separated,""  said Dr T Jayasimha Reddy, president of TDA. 
He added that they are awaiting the constitution of a separate Telangana Dental Council by the state government shortly. 
Presently, every dentist registered with the AP Dental Council has to pay a one-time registration fee of Rs 2,000, besides Rs 400 as annual renewal fees. 
What fuelled the suspicion of TDA members was when state information commissioner M Vijaya Nirmala pulled up the AP Dental Council and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 for not furnishing crucial information about its members and president in answer to an RTI application filed by activist G Suresh more than a year ago.  The information sought included �audited account copies for the last 16 years' and questions like how long has the current president been enjoying the position, among others. 
This was soon followed by a complaint lodged at the Afzalgunj police station by Dr G Vivekananda Reddy, president of the Bhagyanagar chapter of Indian Dental Association, in which he alleged that the AP Dental Council had siphoned off funds on May 15, 2014, a month before the state bifurcation. 
"" The case was closed three months later with the police citing it as a civil dispute,""  said Dr Vivekananda Reddy.  When contacted, Afzalganj police station house officer (SHO) C Anjaiah acknowledged the closure of the case and said they had to do so as the AP Dental Council registrar had agreed to look into the allegations leveled by the complainant. 
Vivekananda Reddy also questioned the propriety of the AP Dental Council members still continuing in their posts without any sort of election since 2000.  However, when contacted, Mahendernath Reddy, who continues to be the regulatory body's president, claimed he was still occupying the post 'by default' and not 'by choice'. 
"" It is the state government's prerogative to hold elections for the state dental council.  They postponed elections to the body three times in a row, the last being in March 2014 citing the impending bifurcation of the two states,""  explained Reddy. 
Refuting all allegations of fund misappropriation, he added, "" The AP Dental Council has no assets.  Even its office space based at Osmania General Hospital comes for free. ""  He asserted that they are maintaining audited records.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Auto driver held for raping minor in Hussainialam  HYDERABAD: Hussainialam police arrested a 23-year-old auto driver for kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl.  At 6 pm on August 19, Md Shareef of Talabkatta picked up the victim, whom he knew for a few months, near Charminar when she went there on some personal work.  Shareef took her to Afzalgunj bus stop in his auto. 
After reaching Afzalgunj, Shareef handed over the auto to his friends and took the victim to Gulbarga in an RTC bus.  In Gulbarga, Shareef checked into a rented room with the victim, posing as pilgrims, and reportedly raped her after promising to marry her.  On August 22, Shareef brought the victim back to Hyderabad and dropped her near her house at Hussainialam. 
The same day, the victim's mother lodged a complaint with police and a case was registered against Shareef under sections 366 (A), 368, 376 and sections 4 & 7 of the Protection of Children from Sexual offences Act, 2012.  The victim was sent for medical examination and police arrested Shareef, when he was waiting near Charminar bus stand on Tuesday morning. 
Charminar ACP K Ashok Chakravarthy said Shareef has a criminal record.  "" Shareef is accused in 14 theft and snatching cases registered at various police stations across the city,""  he said.  The accused was remanded in judicial custody.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Accountant injured in robbers’ attack in Jeedimetla  HYDERABAD: Robbers attacked a 58-year-old accountant with a blunt object at Jeedimetla on Tuesday night and snatched away his hand bag.  Though there was no property loss in the incident, the victim suffered a head injury and police also found a damaged live bullet at the crime scene, triggering speculation about the involvement of armed robbers. 
At 9.45 pm on Tuesday, Raghava Sharma, a resident of Ushodaya Towers apartment in Shapur Nagar, Jeedimetla, and who works as an accountant at Venkateswara Metals at Afzalgunj for a monthly salary of Rs 10,000, reached his apartment complex from his work place. 
“As he was about to get into the lift on the ground floor, two persons reached there and hit Sharma on the head with a blunt object.  The assailants snatched the hand bag of the accountant, joined their associate waiting on a bike outside and sped away.  Later, when we reached the spot, an unusable .22 mm bullet was found on the floor, but Sharma said he had not heard the assailants open fire,” in-charge deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Balanagar, B Srinivas Reddy said. 
Sharma told police that there was only an empty lunch box in the bag.  His condition was said to be out of danger and police registered a case under section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  “We do not know how the bullet reached the location.  Some residents of the apartment complex said they heard a loud noise at the time of the offence, but others told us that nearby electric transformer exploded at the same time,” the in-charge DCP said. 
A CCTV camera near the crime scene was not working and police sent the bullet for forensic analysis.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  The other face of Dhoolpet  HYDERABAD: It's that time of the year again when the city, breaking away from its mundane routines, is set to immerse itself in exalted jubilation, complete with drums, deities, devouts and dandiya.  And as the festive bells start ringing, the spotlight, like always, is found flashing brightly on the narrow bylanes of Dhoolpet from where the celebratory season is usually flagged off. 
Home to a sizable population of the Lodha, Bundeli Rajput and Gangaputra communities, it is in Dhoolpet, a short distance away from Afzalgunj in the Old City, that idols of all gods and goddesses ­ prayed to during the one-month-long festivities ­ are conceptualized, Syed Omar designed and created.  The rows of Durga murtis in particular are the hardest to miss.  “There are lakhs of idols (Ganesha, Durga and Sherawali) that are made in Dhoolpet. These are usually carved out of Plaster of Paris.  And unlike those that are made in Kolkata, their structures are built on iron frames,“ said Manik Mukherjee, president of the adhoc committee of the Hyderabad Bengali Welfare Association that organizes an annual Durga Utsav in the Old City.  “These days, the artisans of Dhoolpet also bring craftsmen from outside and employ them during the festive season,“ he added. 
The towering half-finished deities apart, what's also conspicuous in the area is the pres ence of several vendors waiting impatiently to lure `clients' with their neatly packaged pouches of ganja.  Over the years, this pocket of the city has become synonymous with the sale of the contraband.  And this, despite the presence of a police outpost right in the middle of Jummerat Bazaar, a stone's throw away from here.  In fact, Dhoolpet is itself home to the Mangalhat law and order police station and the prohibition and excise station. 
Notwithstanding such barriers, this flourishing `trade' goes on uninterrupted, beginning as early as 10 am every day .  History has it that residents of this area had ancestors who migrated from north and central India in the 17th century to work for the Nizams.  They took up the sale of the contraband post Independence as a means to eke out a livelihood.  Some have accumulated a lot of wealth since. 
On any given day, as one takes a leisurely stroll through Dhoolpet, one is sure to notice men with `stoned' eyes perched on the chabutras and anxious to sell a `tola' of 'best quality' ganja for Rs 200 to any eager buyer. Try to bargain and the peddler, sporting an unkempt look, wastes no time to retort: “Pachas ka pudi bhi hai lekin dubara idhar nahi aaoge.  Doso ka lelo, phir se khojte hue aaoge. “ (I have packets worth Rs 50 also, but after that you will not come here again.  Take a Rs 200-packet and you'll come looking for me again). 
As night falls, business picks up further.  Even post-midnight, it is not uncommon to see young men and women in sedans and SUVs driving in to 'score'.  “As regulars, we know just when to go there and look for what kind of people.  Even the `sellers', with years of experience, easily identify prospective customers. If they realize you aren't an `interested party' or are generally loafing around, they won't entertain you,“ said a young professional on condition of anonymity.  He confessed that the `dope' available in Dhoolpet is usually of the finest quality . 
Turns out, that the ganja making its way to the city comes from districts such as Warangal, Nizamabad and Visakhapatnam.  The local dealers buy this in bulk for Rs 3,000 a kilo and make 10 times profit when they sell it on the street. 
In addition to ganja, Dhool pet is also notorious for the sale of arrack.  There are about 200 families that are involved in the production, transportation and sale of illicit liquor. 
Police authorities, while ad mitting to Dhoolpet being a den of illegal activities, claim tha such `businesses' are on the de cline in the area.  “Bootlegging and drug peddling are coming down due to stringent enforce ment activities.  In the past one month, we have booked five of fenders under the PD (Preven tion of Dangerous Activities Act and the process has been initiated to book repeat offend ers.  We are also conducting a lo of awareness campaigns in the locality to explain to people why they need to opt for alternative livelihoods,“ said Ujwala Reddy assistant prohibition & excise superintendent, Dhoolpet.

HYDERABAD: Lack of adequate groundwork before announcing major policy decisions coupled with the absence of consultations with experts and officials, appears to be taking a toll on the image of the Telangana government, especially chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.  In an attempt to leave his mark on the city in an unseemly hurried manner, the CM only ended up earning the sobriquet — a ‘U-turn CM’ — with many of his major announcements being given a quiet burial. 
The latest among a series of such about-turns is the apparent go ahead to construction of metro rail as per the original alignment in front of the legislative assembly building.  In the first session of the assembly last year, Chandrasekhar Rao announced that he would not allow the metro rail in front of the assembly, ostensibly to protect the heritage building from getting marred.  Larsen & Toubro then submitted about six months ago an alternative route diverting the line from behind the assembly and the office of the director general of police (DGP) building.  And a year later, the government now wants L&T go ahead with the original project plans.  The delay resulted in avoidable escalation which could have saved the state exchequer a few hundred crores of rupees. 
In yet another example of a hasty decision, KCR, who tried to drum up support for several months for sale of cheap liquor in the state claiming the demand came from public in the state, finally gave his nod to the ill-conceived move just before the new excise policy was announced last month.  But faced with an increasing opposition from civil society, women’s groups and political parties, the cheap liquor idea, with which the government hoped to fill its coffers, was given a reluctant burial. 
Among the decisions that received widespread attention and bitter criticism were the CM’s plan to build a new Secretariat complex in place of the Chest Hospital at Erragadda.  A GO was issued for shifting hospital to Vikarabad and a committee was constituted to hammer out the details of the secretariat building.  But with severe opposition from doctors and para-medical staff, legal wrangles and heritage status issues, the government has gone quiet on the move.  Later, he shifted his focus to a parade ground at Bison Polo grounds at Secunderabad for his new Secretariat building.  His fixation on moving the Secretariat was mainly driven by his belief that the existing Secretariat is not in accordance with Vaastu. 
The evident lack of thought is also reflected in a decision to ‘construct’ Vinayak Sagar in the Indira Park - one of the last remaining green lungs in the city - a pit deep enough to submerge the tens of thousands of Ganesha idols.  Clearly, the CM appears to have been of the belief that a fiat from his office would solve all problems, notwithstanding any opposition from the likes of Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Committee or the traffic nightmare that would result from the narrow approach roads to the park jammed with vehicles carrying the idols for immersion. 
The controversial decisions on shifting of Osmania General Hospital (OGH) from Afzalgunj has since been put on hold despite Chandrasekhar Rao’s directions to officials to bulldoze the existing heritage structure and construct a new building complex for the hospital.  Opposition to this move mounted rapidly and, clearly taken aback, especially after his ally MIM differed with the government on the issue, the health minister announced in the assembly recently that any decision on OGH demolition will be taken only after consulting the heritage conservation committee. 
Among other decisions on which Chandrasekhar Rao had to eat the humble pie were denial of fee reimbursement to students from the residuary Andhra Pradesh last year, demolition of illegal constructions that have been confined only to the Ayyappa Society in the city as well as emptying of Hussainsagar lake. 
Analysts say major decisions are being announced without adequate study of related issues.  If he is indeed keen on making a difference, then he should be open to suggestions from different quarters and then take a decision on its merits and not just on whims and fancies.  Only such an approach may ultimately boost the government’s image.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.  No books for TPSC aspirants at State Central Library  HYDERABAD: Hundreds of job-aspirants hailing from across the state are dismayed with the State Central Library in Afzalgunj. 
Their grouse is that the library does not have any of the prescribed textbooks that are required to crack the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC). 
The library currently has textbooks which are outdated for the exams, said aspirants. 
“Earlier the syllabus was based on the united Andhra Pradesh, but after the bifurcation of the state, the Telangana government came with its own syllabi and prescribed few textbooks.  Unfortunately these books are very hard to find in the open markets,” said, C Suresh, an aspirant from Mahboobnagar, who has been doing the rounds of the library for the last eight months, only to be disheartened. 
While officials in the library claim that they have all the textbooks in place, students fail to exude the same confidence.  According to the students the same is the case with the City Library in Chikkadpally. 
“We are left with no option but to come to this library every day.  The books published by the Telugu Akademi are prescribed for such exams.  But, they have no such books in the library.  The last series of books that they have from this publisher dates back to 10 years ago,” said Mohd Ghouse, who has been aspiring to get a prestigious government job for the last three years. 
Ghouse also said that he tried his hands at getting an admission into a minority study circle, but the government has been dilly-dallying on this matter as well. 
“The government says that the notification for the minority study circles will be issued only after the results of the Warangal bypolls come out.  Until that time we will have to wait,” he said. 
A menial glance of the library shows that there are more students snoozing inside the library, than those studying. 
However, the curators of the library say that they have received several written letters from the students about the books and are doing their best to procure them. 
“We have received three editions of these books, but there were mistakes in all of them so we had to return them.  All of these books had typographical errors, spelling mistakes and omissions.  Once the Telugu Akademi releases new books we will be the first to receive it,” said a librarian, requesting anonymity.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

AIS officers’ allotment nears completion The allotment of All India Service officers between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States is as good as over though it’s a provisional one.  But the suspense over the fate of ten of them continues as the two governments have written a joint letter to the Centre seeking their retention in the respective States for administrative convenience. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The governments had earlier made the requests separately, but the Centre insisted that they approach it together.  The AP government sought retention of services of IAS officers Ajay Jain, A. K.  Singhal and Sidharth Jain and IPS officer A. R.  Anuradha.  On the other hand, Telangana wanted Poonam Malakondaiah, Somesh Kumar, Jayesh Ranjan and Ronald Ross.  Amid mounting anxiety among these officers, speculation is rife that the governments may be allowed their services only for two months. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leading by example,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That’s what Syed Omer Jaleel, Secretary, did on Sunday.  The civil servant donated blood on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the Prophet of Islam.  Mr.  Jaleel went to the Asafia State Central Library at Afzalgunj where a blood donation camp was organised and took part in the programme. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr.  Naidu completed the exercise for a massive reshuffle even as the IAS, IPS and forest service officers were ready with relieving orders and joining reports in their hands.  The Chief Minister is very particular about the choice of officers and “that’s why he is called CEO”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As many as 52 IAS officers from AP are set to join the Telangana government and about 30 vice-versa, but only some of them got relieving orders by Sunday. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AIS officers bow to their fate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The swapping of All India Service officers between the two States which was permitted by the Centre is going to remain a sour experience for the remaining part of the career for those involved in it.  A few senior IAS officers on either side are personally interested in working for the other State, but they have no choice except to accept the allocation as they are not in line for swapping by the two States.  “I know it will be very difficult to work and defend the interests of a State with the desire to work for the other State in mind.  There’s no other go but to accept it as our fate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officials ready to shift,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the IAS officers have already started making arrangements to shift to the new place of work, much before they were served relieving orders. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survey of city road corridors soon In tune with the ambitious plans of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to ensure seamless travel facility in the form of signal free corridors, multi-level separators and elevated expressways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The study by the engineering wing of civic body would look at all these corridors and junctions to be able to indicate the available Right of Way (RoW) with levels.  This survey would be followed by consultants Lea Associates prioritising the projects from among the identified works which could be easy to take up and implement early.  During a recent meeting held by the Chief Minister, it was decided to prioritise projects to the tune of Rs.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr.  Rao has suggested taking up strategic road development of eight corridors, Uppal Junction to Sangeet Junction, Abids to Chaderghat via Koti, Habsiguda to IDA Mallapur, Hayathnagar to Nalgonda Crossroads, Chaderghat-Putlibowli-Jambagh-Nampally and Puranapul to Aramgarh via Zoo.  Apart from these road corridors, he also suggested improvement of junctions such as Koti, RTC Crossroads, Secunderabad, Uppal, L. B.  Nagar, Chaderghat, Putlibowli and Bahadurpura. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lea Associates which earlier came up with the Comprehensive Transportation Study (CTS) for the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority, would also prepare preliminary designs based on survey inputs generated by the GHMC. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The voluminous data on traffic and road conditions as part of the CTS would come handy for taking up the works, said T. S.  Reddy, road levels and how new facilities could be incorporated. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Based on the survey inputs, feasibilities would be assessed on what feature will suit a corridor.  Land availability is crucial for multi-level separators with a minimum requirement being around 150 feet to 200 feet,000 as bribe from them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police Commissioner M.  Mahender Reddy suspended the two officials on Friday after an internal inquiry was ordered following allegations of the duo releasing the offenders by taking money.  Satish is an SI of 2004 batch, while Rao belongs to the 2010 batch. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Strike deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to police sources, the officials got information that a two-member, Imlibun. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instead of informing the higher-ups and interrogating the suspects detained, the SI and the DI struck a deal with the robbers demanding huge money to set them free without registering any cases.  The duo finally agreed to pay Rs.  50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The suspects were taken to a hotel and provided biryani as their associates transferred the money into two bank accounts specified by the two police officials.  While Rs.  25,000 was credited in one account belonging to the DI’s close relative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once the money was transferred, the two persons were let off.  However,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An inquiry confirmed the complicity of the duo in setting free the thieves after ascertaining the text messages and phone calls made with the gang, police sources said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police officers charged with taking bribe from the robbers for their release GHMC to go for geo Planning a major initiative to improve the road conditions and come up with elevated corridors and flyovers in the city, the GHMC has decided to rope in consultancy services for geo-technical investigations along major corridors. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Under the Strategic Road Development Plan for Hyderabad, the civic body has invited technical and financial proposals from consultancy services for a series of activities aimed at understanding the soil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The detailed geo-technical investigation sought for roads include trench pit analysis to be carried out at the interface of earthen shoulder and bituminous road, thickness and type of sub-base while identifying thickness and type of sub-base and bituminous courses at every one km interval.  For locations being considered for flyovers, the civic body wishes for trial bore of different depths to generate detailed analysis for soil and rock samples at different depth intervals.  This is to result in recommendations for suitable foundations for the project components such as flyover and elevated corridors.  Also, for classification and to design transmission line towers rationally, geo-technical investigations are to be taken up at specified tower locations for inputs on substrata profile and relevant soil and rock parameters at the given site. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GHMC is also keen on the appointed consultants obtaining information and reviewing existing local knowledge on streams in the neighbourhood, water resources, wells that are unlined, landslides and recent land fills. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recently, the Chief Minister, Tank Bund-Afzalgunj, Abids-Chaderghat via Koti, Habsiguda-Mallapur, Hayathnagar-Nalgonda Crossroads, Chaderghat-Putlibowli-Jambagh-Nampally and Puranapul-Aramgarh.  Different strokes for different folks If a citizen leaves his vehicle at a no parking zone, traffic police rush and impose a fine.  Chances of the vehicle owner facing criminal case are more if the latter enters into argument with the policeman on the issue. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the contrary, an Inspector doesn’t have to face any criminal case or pay any fine even after being accused of collecting Rs.  50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A case in point is the recent suspension of Afzalgunj Detective Inspector Satish and Sub-Inspector Prasad Rao.  An inquiry report says the duo had set free two members of a Delhi-based gang lifting passengers’ suitcases at bus-stands after collecting money from their associates. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officials are evolving new systems by investing crores of rupees of public money to make people follow traffic rules and proposing Road Safety Acts with steep fine amounts for jumping signals or irregular parking.  It is a paradox that the two police officials are suspended though their action amounted to extortion. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unlike other cases, these two police officials got the money from the gang transferred to the bank accounts of their close relatives indicating that they indulged in this in an organised manner.  Still,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will ‘collectors’ get back to policing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the police higher-ups are striving hard to strengthen police-public relations through people-friendly policing concepts, the ground realities seem to be quite different. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For instance, the government started providing corpus fund between Rs.  25,000 given earlier, which resulted in policemen seeking ‘help’ of complainants and commercial establishments.  It was common practice at the police stations to ask complainants to bring office stationery, get photocopies of official documents and arrange fuel for vehicles.  They also took the ‘help’ of business establishments located in the jurisdiction of the police station for finances. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the purpose of overseeing the collection of money and spending, a policeman used to be assigned as ‘collector’ by each police station with the task of collecting a fixed amount of money from hotels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the trend continues even after the government started granting funds to run the police station.  Most businessmen pay up for fear of police harassment.  Now that the higher-ups are talking about bridging the gap between the police and public through a friendly approach, G.  Karthik, R.  Chiranjeeevi and K.  Satish while two others gang members Kumar and Ravi are absconding. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The police seized 581 notes, a car and five cell phones from them.  As of now, which were demonetised by that country earlier. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also resolved to pressurise the Telangana government to cut down road tax levied within the State by more than half. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At a meeting held here on Saturday with Syed Nizamuddin in the chair, the bus operators chalked out their course of action. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They planned to organise protest meetings every Saturday beginning May 9 at Afzalgunj, Vidyanagar, we will not pay road tax for the next quarter,” Mr.  Nizamuddin declared. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Telangana bus operators are now asked to pay border tax of Rs.  330 per seat or nearly Rs.  8,000 for a 22-seater carriage per trip to Andhra Pradesh.  Most of the contract carriages depend on religious tourism and operate nearly 5, Sri Kalahasti, Kanaka Durga temple, Vijayawada and Mantralayam. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the border tax is not reduced, then it will render a death blow to the industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“None of us will be able to operate buses to Andhra Pradesh as we cannot shift the additional burden on the passengers,” the bus operators said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In separate representations made to the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the TSCBOA said the border tax would have an adverse impact on the tourism industry leading to revenue loss to both the States. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bus operators urged the Telangana government to reduce the present rate of road tax of Rs.  893 per seat fixed during united Andhra Pradesh.  If the tax is proportionately divided into 10 districts instead of 23 then the bus operators will have to pay just Rs.  390 per seat. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They further asked the Telangana government to join the agreement of southern States on border tax. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As per the agreement, there is no border tax for contract carriage vehicles entering Tamil Nadu and Kerala. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the bifurcation of the State, the agreement was valid only for Andhra Pradesh. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being the new southern State, Telangana should have automatically become a part of the agreement. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Therefore, the government should join this agreement to bail out the travel industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite the shift from customs and traditions in the run up to the Eid-ul-Fitr, the handmade vermicelli or ‘seviyah’ continues to hold its sway.  Year after year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is the magic played by bare hands that continues to sway the market.  “First, we mix maida and salt with hands and then we pound the dough.  It is spread evenly into strings and dried in the sun.  It is a laborious process.  A family of six persons can prepare about 25 to 30 kg only in a day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Handmade vermicelli continues to be in great demand as people prefer to use it as an ingredient in the mouth watering ‘sheer khurma’, the desert served on the Eid day.  A kilo of handmade vermicelli costs between Rs.  120 and Rs.  150 while the regular machine made costs less. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“The machine made is not used as it forms into a pulp when mixed with milk while the handmade floats in the sheer khurma and tastes good,” Yasmeen Begum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women take to the trade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The age-old trade despite its popularity and demand is finding difficult to hold its ground owing to the laborious work involved in making it.  Youngsters especially men are no more preferring the trade. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Women are slowly taking over the vocation from men.  Not only hard work but low profit is also pushing men away from the trade,” says a woman who learnt the vocation from her mother-in-law. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To top it, this year the rains have played the spoilsport for the tribe. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The moist weather conditions spoil the stuff.

His family is one amongst the ten families from the old city who are into the vocation for decades.  “Our ancestors were the first to introduce vermicelli in the city. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those into the trade are mostly members of our extended family,” he claims.  ‘Seviyah’ continues to be in demand Local dates (‘khajoor’) gave way to imported varieties and traditional ‘besan mirchi’ to burgers and pizzas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the shift in customs and traditions the handmade vermicelli or ‘seviyah’ continues to give tough competition to the machine made variety Osmania needs healing touch, not euthanasia Call a dog mad and kill it.  Brand a landmark heritage building unfit for human occupation and pull it down.  That seems to be the credo of a section of the government officials. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quite surprising for a government that owns up the Nizam and has assumed power on the plank of safeguarding Telangana’s culture and the rich built heritage. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The otherwise culturally hyper sensitive Chief Minister K.

Half-baked report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr.  Rao cannot be blamed for he was merely going by a half-baked report of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and improper advice of group of doctors who seemed to be totally unaware of the historicity of the place. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apart from serving lakhs of patients over the years not just from united Andhra Pradesh, but from Karnataka and Maharashtra, a knotty medical issue relating to use and effect of Chloroform as anaesthetic was resolved by the hospital’s illustrious Resident Superintendent, Edward Lawrie in 1890. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Osmania General Hospital with its signature domes rising into the sky was built in 1920s by the seventh Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan after a part of Afzalgunj Hospital was destroyed in Great Musi floods of 1908. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Internal courtyards, wide spacious arched wards and windows overlooking a sprawling garden and the Musi river were the features that many old timers believe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr.  Rao’s concern for safety of patients is understandable, but he should be wary of the recommendations of government-appointed expert committees which for some reason seem to be allergic to heritage buildings in the city. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If one were to go by their reports submitted in the past, none of the government owned heritage buildings should exist and these include the royal Raj Bhavan, a palace away from madding crowd (in those days) Irrum Numa (Chest Hospital at Erragadda) and Government Nizamia Tibbi Unani Hospital near Charminar to name a few. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The trigger is always a plaster peeling off the roof or from a wall that can be easily repaired that happens again because of government’s negligence.

The government will then lose the moral authority to ask private owners to conserve the other 90-odd listed buildings. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides Raj Bhavan which was restored after a similar panic reaction of a panel, Hyderabad fortunately has other fine examples of restoration and conservation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key to maintenance of old palaces and buildings is re-adapt and re-use and not knocking them down or keeping them idle and it does not cost much for a government that boasts of surplus revenue, much of it from Hyderabad.

Commuters to get free  Wi-Fi access on MG Marg Travelling through the congested lanes of the MG Marg also known as the Main Road would become slightly less irritating as commuters’ sour experiences of careening on the busiest road of the capital would be mellowed down by providing free Wi-fi Internet access for the first 20 minutes. 
The initiative sanctioned by the Ranchi Municipal Corporation envisages using existing infrastructure as well as the under construction high-mast lED towers on the Main Road from Albert Ekka Chowk to Sujata Chowk.  The free access would cease after 20 minutes.  The municipal corporation has allowed Bharti-Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone and another telecommunication company to use their infrastructure on rent. 
“They will put their machines on high-mast at Albert Ekka Chowk and will put up routers on light poles on the street.  There is no user charge however the company would pay us `12,000 for using high-mast tower,” said PRO of RMC, Naresh Kumar Sinha. 
Additionally, the four telecommunication companies have also been asked to maintain the lED lights on the high-mast and also to bear the electricity usage charge.  The service providers would also pay rent of `800 per pole for using the light poles to extend the Internet connectivity on the one-and-a-half kilometre stretch. 
Meanwhile, the RMC’s initiative is being projected as a step towards transforming Ranchi into a smart city and catapulting it into league of cities with uninterrupted Internet connectivity. 
“This is one of the components of smart city and it has to be done by the RMC with the help of private companies.  The proposal is in initial stage and later on other issues like security of the network and preventing its misuse will be our focus,” said Deputy Mayor of RMC, Sanjeev Vijaywargiya. 
The proposal moved by telecommunication service providers would bring other prominent streets under the cover in later phases and as part of the proposal the companies have also expressed their desire to provide free Internet access at Government offices in Ranchi.

Sunpedh," Now, Haryana cops booked for killing dalit boy over pigeon theft  CHANDIGARH: Barely two days after two dalit children were burnt alive in Haryana's Sunpedh village in Faridabad, a 14-year-old dailt boy was allegedly killed by cops, hours after he was questioned for stealing two pigeons in Sonipat's Gohana town.  The boy was picked up by cops on Wednesday.  His body was found hanging from a hook in the ceiling in an empty house owned by a relative right behind his own house in Govindpura locality of Gohana on Thursday morning.  In protest, angry people blocked the Gohana-Jullana road and also organised a sit-in on the railway tracks for about three hours with Govinda's body.  Not wanting another political grenade to explode as in the case of the Faridabad murders, the authorities quickly booked the two ASIs of Gohana police station, Subhash and Ashok, for murder.  Cops refused to give the surnames of the two accused.  Even Govinda's full name was not given in the FIR.  On the condition of anonymity, local police officials said it was likely that Govinda hanged himself after being accused of theft.  The victim's family has, however, alleged that the two ASIs killed Govinda despite taking a bribe of Rs 10,000.  They alleged that the boy was first killed in custody and his body was later hanged near his home to make it look like a suicide.  Govinda belonged to a family of daily-wagers.  His father, Rampal, had died a few years ago.  On Thursday, Ganaur deputy superintendent of police, Satish Kumar, who has been put in charge of law and order at Gohana after the incident, told TOI that the FIR has been registered against the ASIs on the complaint by the victim's brother Gautam.  Gautam had taken Govinda to the police station after members of the nomadic tribe of Gariya Lohar which had put up a temporary settlement in the neighbourhood accused Govinda of stealing their pigeons.  Police sources claimed that both parties had reached a compromise after they were brought face-to-face at the police station.  "" They said they would release Govinda in a couple of hours on Wednesday after they accepted the bribe, but they didn't,""  alleged Gautam.  Protests in Gohana led to two passenger trains running between Rohtak and Panipat, being cancelled on Thursday while one train was delayed for few hours.  Sources said police tried to talk to the protesters and end the blockade but were chased away.  Family seeks arrest by 11am on Friday Govinda's family did not cremate his body on Thursday after the autopsy and demanded that the two cops accused of his murder be suspended and arrested by 11am on Friday.  They have threatened not to cremate the body until their demand is met.  Senior dalit leaders are expected to reach Gohana on Friday. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.  Dalit immolation: Maya man to meet kin in Faridabad village  LUCKNOW: Intending to rake up the Faridabad incident in which two children of a dalit family were burnt alive allegedly by people from the upper caste, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Saturday sent her emissary and former party MP Raja Ram to the meet the family and bring in every detail of the incident. 
BSP sources said Mayawati asked Raja Ram, an influential BSP functionary from Azamgarh district in UP, to project the incident as a case study on atrocities on dalits not only in Bihar but also in UP where assembly elections are due in 2017.  BSP sources said Mayawati may visit the family after Bihar assembly elections. 
Raja Ram confirmed to TOI that he will visit the village and meet the family.  “Whatever feedback we get would be sent to the party president for further directions,” he said.  “Our functionaries have been helping the aggrieved ever since the incident took place and a strategy is proposed on how to help the family, emotionally as well as financially,” he said. 
BSP state president in Haryana, Naresh Sarang said the atrocities on dalits were not new in Haryana with people of the lower caste in substantial numbers.  “Dalits are targeted in the state regularly,” he told TOI.  Narang said in Sunpedh village, around 40km from Faridabad, dalits, are in minority, therefore, prone to oppression.  Sources said dalits in the regions are essentially Jatavs, the caste to which Mayawati belongs. 
A day earlier, Mayawati had alleged the Faridabad incident happened in the presence of police.  She not only demanded resignation of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, she also sought action against minister of state for foreign affairs General V K Singh for his alleged ‘dog’ remark in the context of the Faridabad incident. 
Political experts insist the incident has given an opportunity to Mayawati to tighten her grip on her core dalit vote bank which otherwise slipped into the hands of the saffron camp during Lok Sabha elections.  “She has been silent on atrocities on dalits for quite some time and as a result her vote bank shifted, but now she wants to influence dalits,” said S R Darapuri, political commentator.  “Her action, however, is politically influenced.  During her stint as UP CM there were instances of dalit atrocities and she could not stop them,” he added.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Village in grief, Haryana Chief Minister orders CBI probe A day after four members of a Dalit family were set ablaze inside their house at Sunpedh village here, the Haryana government on Wednesday conceded all the four demands of the family, including a CBI probe into the incident. 
In a late-evening announcement, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said his government had decided to order a CBI probe and provide a government job to Jitender, father of the two children who died in the attack. 
Free treatment will be provided to Jitender’s wife Rekha, who is recuperating at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. 
The village erupted in grief and indignation on Wednesday when the bodies of two-year-old Vaibhav and 10-month-old Divya, wrapped in white shrouds, arrived for cremation. 
Wailing soon gave way to anger and scores of villagers, walking hand in hand and shouting slogans, carried the bodies and placed them on the Delhi-Agra Highway, blocking traffic.  They protested for more than two hours in support of the four demands. 
As villagers staged the protest, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment and Faridabad MP Krishan Pal Gurjar, reached Sun Perh village in the evening. 
Mr.  Gurjar met the family and apprised the villagers of the government’s decision to concede all their demands.  The villagers then agreed to perform the last rites of the two children who died in the attack.  “The government has conceded the demands and the family has agreed to cremate the bodies,” Mr.  Gurjar told The Hindu. 
Haryana DGP Y. P.  Singal said the situation in the village was under control.  “They tried to block the National Highway [in Faridabad], but we made them understand that this will put thousands of commuters to inconvenience.  Then, they protested with the bodies on the outer road.  After persuasion, they agreed to conduct the last rites,” he said. 
One more accused, Sanjay, was arrested on Wednesday, taking the total number of arrests to four.  The Chief Minister ordered the police to arrest the remaining seven accused at the earliest.  “All efforts are being made to arrest the remaining accused.  Their family members have been rounded up.  Five Special Investigation Teams have been constituted under Deputy Commissioner of Police Puran Chand,” Faridabad Police Commissioner Subhash Yadav said. 
Meanwhile, four more policemen have been suspended for grave misconduct in discharging their duties.  On Tuesday, four policemen were suspended for dereliction of duty.  A regular departmental inquiry has been initiated against all eight policemen.  Those suspended include Sadar Ballabhgarh SHO, Inspector Anil Kumar, Assistant Sub-Inspectors Wali Mohammad, Hari Singh and Shri Bhagwan and constables Vikash, Sandeep, Satish and Ram Mehar.

(With inputs from PTI) Amid outcry, Khattar visits Dalit family Amid sharp criticism from the Opposition over the Faridabad incident, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar lal Khattar on Thursday visited the family of the two Dalit children who were burnt alive at Sunpedh Village and said the incident should not be given a “political or casteist colour”. 
Khattar, who was expected to meet the family on Wednesday, had to defer the visit in the wake of protests by angry locals. 
Two toddlers, two-and-a-half-year-old Vaibhav and 9-month-old Divya died after their house was set on fire by members of an upper caste community on the intervening night of October 19 and 20.  Their mother Rekha is currently in hospital with 70 per cent burns while father Jitender also sustained injuries in the incident. 
During the 15-minute-long meeting with the family, the Chief Minister assured the family that the State Government would bear the cost of treatment of the injured mother, Rekha, who is recuperating in Safdarjung Hospital. 
He assured Jitender and his family members that the culprits would be brought to justice after investigation.  Khattar also handed over a cheque of `10 lakh to the aggrieved family. 
While talking to the mediapersons, the Chief Minister said that the CBI enquiry is already marked into this incident.  So far, six of the 11 accused have been arrested and the others would be nabbed soon.  Eight Police personnel who had been deployed for the protection of the victim family have been suspended for showing grave misconduct in discharging their duties, said he. 
“We want that the investigation is done properly.  But with great regret I have to say that some parties are trying to politicise this incident.  It should not be given a “political or casteist colour,” said Khattar slamming the Opposition. 
“I met the victim’s family today and handed them over a cheque of `10 lakh.  So far, what has emerged from the investigation is that the matter is not a caste-related dispute but appears to be fallout of a long standing family feud,” he added. 
The Chief Minister said, “I have been monitoring this case since the very beginning and when allegations came up against police officials, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed.  later the case was handed over to CBI as the relatives of the victim demanded that. ”
Khattar also called Haryana a “peaceful” state and claimed that such incidents are not likely to happen again.  later, he travelled to outskirts of the village and met the relatives of the accused at a circuit house.  He had a ten-minute meeting with the wives of three persons who were allegedly killed last year by relatives of Jitender hence fuelling the family enmity further.  People from Rajput community from 12 villages also met the Chief Minister and demanded that narco-test of members of the both the families (accused and victim) should be conducted. 
Under attack from the Opposition and ally lJP, the Haryana Government had a day before recommended a CBI probe into the incident. 
After the gruesome incident came to the light, the politicians made a beeline for the village on Wednesday.  Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had visited the village where he accused the Prime Minister, Khattar, the BJP and RSS of practising “politics of crushing” those who are weak which results in such incidents. 
Haryana Pradesh Congress president Ashok Tanwar, Haryana ClP leader Kiran Chaudhry, Congress leader Kumari Selja, BJP MP from Ambala Rattan lal Kataria, CPM’s Brinda Karat, AAP leaders Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh and Ramdas Athawale, MP from Maharashtra, also landed up at the village on Wednesday. 
This fresh attack on a Dalit family in Haryana has sparked a fresh bout of acrimonious exchanges between the Opposition and the ruling BJP.  Amid outcry, CM Khattar visits Dalit family Amid sharp criticism from the Opposition over the Faridabad incident, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar lal Khattar on Thursday visited the family of the two Dalit children who were burnt alive at Sunpedh Village and said the incident should not be given a “political or casteist colour”.

BJP accuses Congress of giving "" caste colour""  to Dalit killing NEW DELHI: BJP today hit out at the Congress for giving "" caste colour""  to the killing of two Dalit children in Faridabad, calling it "" height of insensitivity""  that must be condemned. 
BJP secretary Shrikant Sharma said the incident was born out of enmity between two families and noted that three members of the other family were killed earlier. 
"" It is nothing but frustration on the part of those who are giving this incident a caste colour.  This is height of insensitivity.  We condemn it,""  he said. 
Two children of a Dalit family died and their parents suffered burn injuries after their home was set on fire, allegedly by upper-caste Rajputs in Sunpedh, a village in Faridabad near Delhi, in the early hours of Tuesday. 
Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had visited the family yesterday and alleged that weak people were being suppressed under the BJP government. 
"" It was time for such people to do introspection over how many Dalits were killed when they were in power,""  Sharma said, in a reference to incidents of violence against Dalits when Congress was power at the Centre as well as Haryana. 
BJP appreciates Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's decision to refer the case to CBI for investigation, he said. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suchi Pind,"Birs gutted in gurdwara fire  JALANDHAR: Four Birs of Guru Granth Sahib were gutted at a gurudwara in Suchi Pind on Sunday afternoon.  It is suspected that the fire was caused due to a short-circuit in the air-conditioner fitted in a room where the Birs were kept.  It took around half an hour for the fire tenders to douse the flames, but, by that time, carpets and other items in the gurdwara had been destroyed.  In the evening, members of Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee reached the spot and demanded that a case be registered against the gurdwara managing committee president.  After talks, a 13-member committee was formed to decide on corrective measures and management of the gurudwara. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Makkar pulls up religious body for getting case registered against gurdwara management, granthi  JALANDHAR: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Avtar Singh Makkar faced piquant situation in Suchi Pind gurdwara, where four birs of Guru Granth Sahib were gutted in fire on Monday.  Representatives of around half a dozen gurdwara committees offered keys of their gurdwaras to protest against the case registered on Sunday late night against the managing committee and "" granthi""  of gurdwara holding them responsible for the fire.  Makkar had to face angry reaction from area residents as he was trying to pacify them and criticized Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee members under whose pressure police registered the case of maliciously hurting religious sentiments.  Residents said they had built and decorated the gurdwara with their offerings over several years, and if they had to face such cases, when they also were very sad due to the fire, then it was better for them to stay away from running the worship place's affairs.  The case has also brought out the differences between Akal Takht Jathedar Gurbachan Singh and SGPC president as the former had reportedly advocated registration of a case against the managing committee.  SGPC preacher Tarlochan Kaur publicly announced amid hundreds on Sunday evening that the jathedar had asked her to get a case registered against the managing committee and "" granthi""  of the gurdwara.  However, on Monday, Makkar pulled up Tarlochan in front of several Sikh leaders and activists and asked to communicate with SGPC only and not directly to the Akal Takht jathedar.  Though Makkar refrained from openly saying anything about jathedar's stand, he minced no words in criticizing the Satkar Committee, which enjoys backing of the jathedar.  Makkar had also rung up Kapurthala senior superintendent of police asking him to take strict action against Satkar Committee members who had thrashed three "" granthis""  as the video of their act went viral.  The case was registered on Sunday night after Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee mounted pressure for action against the managing committee while alleging that they indulged in gross negligence even as they were warned about it.  On the complaint of one Kartar Singh, police registered the case against managing committee and granthi Gurpreet Singh under sections 295A and 427 of the IPC.  An inquiry committee of the SGPC also reached Suchi Pind and recorded statements of the villagers and managing committee members.  Makkar said it was an accident and it was wrong to get a case registered against the gurdwara committee or granthi. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.

Moolakadai,"Funds unspent as state highways department loses steam  CHENNAI: With weeks to go for the next state budget, the focus is now on projects announced in the past few years and the funds for them. 
While grand and ambitious plans were unveiled in previous budgets of the AIADMK government, the rate of progress achieved by the highways department on long-gestation projects has been slow.  Officials say with limited manpower and an array of roadblocks, especially in the city, the pace of work has been extremely slow. 
The metro wing of the state highways department — which has the most projects pending — has not been able to spend more than 200 crore every year.  Each year, it is allotted around 450 crore.  “Flyover projects at Tirumangalam, Porur and Moolakadai have been going on for years and yet in terms of progress, there is little to show,” said an engineer.  “If it is about road laying, we can spend up to 20 crore overnight.  But with flyovers, the work is slowed down by land acquisition, shifting of underground utility lines and protests by residents,” he added. 
The slow pace of work is clearly a sore point with residents, especially those living on the outskirts where the surge in real estate development and vehicle population is not matched by expansion in infrastructure.  “I’ll save at least 20 minutes if the Moolakadi flyover is completed.  It gets worse in the evenings when the traffic comes to a standstill,” said R Chandru, a driver who commutes between Moolakadai and Perumbur every day. 
The metro wing is also burdened by the task of preparing feasibility studies and project reports since many of them involve long-term planning, traffic projection and coordination with other agencies.  Some of the pending works include flyovers on Grand Southern Trunk (GST) Road, East Coast Road and widening of Inner Ring Road and Pallavaram — Thoraipakkam Road.  An L-shaped bridge is also in the works near the Madipakkam-Velachery junction.  The government is also mulling over building expressways along GST Road and Old Mahabalipuram Road. 
Across the state, while the department was supposed to spend to 4,095crore in 2013-14, it managed to spend only around 3,300 crore.  Similarly, while 5,812crore was allotted for the financial year 2014-15, the department has spent only about 3,500crore and has just a few weeks left. 
Given the sheer backlog of projects, the highways department may choose not to announce any major new proposals when the budget is unveiled this time. 
Usually, officials say, the maximum number of proposals and announcements are made just before the election year.  “But right now the department is understaffed and there is simply no money for new proposals.  There is no point sending new proposals as they have to be followed with feasibility studies, DPRs (detailed project reports) and tenders,” said an official.  “We have only proposed road widening along Inner Ring Road in Retteri,” said an engineer from the department.

Dr RK Nagar bypoll: High turnout for a Chennai constituency  CHENNAI: With a 74% voter turnout, the R K Nagar bypoll is an endorsement of sorts of the AIADMK’s strength in this urban constituency.  While factors like opposition boycott and the fact that AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa herself had contested here besides this being a bypoll, could not be discounted, rarely has a constituency in Chennai district recorded such high turnout in recent years.  Voter apathy has always been a discouraging trend in urban constituencies. 
In R K Nagar on Saturday, however, it was a carnival of sorts.  For voters here had never seen such a high profile candidate.  Hopes soared that the constituency would finally get attention.  After days of high-voltage campaign by ruling partymen, voters turned up in huge numbers to cast their voters.  The polling stations of Tondiarpet, Korukkupet and New Washermenpet were crowded with auto-rickshaws ferrying voters to the booths even for shorter distances.  The trouble-free and brisk polling in most of the booths took the polling percentage to 53.1% at 2pm.  “But things went out of hand after that,” CPI senior leader and candidate C Mahendran alleged.  He accused the AIADMK partymen of barging into polling booths and casting bogus votes . 
The election commission may have embarked on an authentication drive a few months ago to eliminate “defects, errors and multiple entries” in the electoral rolls, but some “outsiders” gleefully cast votes using their old voter identity cards.  A Tamilarasan and R Meena, residents of Thideer Nagar in the constituency, some six years ago moved to Aminjikarai.  But they managed to vote in Chennai Middle School in Pudumanaikuppam.  “Our houses were damaged in the tsunami and we wish to hold the same voter ID until we get new houses,” they said. 
Observers pointed to the presence of the entire cabinet and party functionaries from districts in the constituency from early June.  Several of them rented houses for a brief stay to canvass for votes.  DMK spokesperson T K S Elangovan alleged that money was freely circulated along with goodies.  “What else could have been the reason for the high turnout?” he asked. 
The opposition alleged that goodies were distributed to voters despite the election commission deploying 28 flying squads and 100 close circuit cameras to monitor the constituency.  Some of the voters of Kasipuram, Vinayagapuram and YMCA Kuppam off Jeevarathnam Street said sarees and sartorial material were freely distributed.  “A water tap was provided for us two days ago and we have been promised pattas in the coming months,” said S Ramashree, a resident of Kasimpuram.  At a corporation primary school in New Washermenpet, R Mahalakshmi, who recently shifted to Moolakadai, said she collected her goodies from a neighbour. 
Voters hoped that the arrival of ‘Amma’ would put an end to water woes in the constituency, which got only ‘smelly’ supply in taps for several decades “We purchase two pots of water at Re 1 from water supplied by a street tanker.  Amma will ensure good supply,” said S Rajinikumari, a Korukkupet resident.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  The meat you eat: How safe is it  Ill-equipped, unhygienic and unmonitored, the corporation's makeshift abattoir in north Chennai's Pulianthope is posing health risks to the public. 
While the newly-built modern abattoir next door remains closed over political differences, meat lovers will have to contend with the abysmal conditions under which goats are slaughtered and transported to butcher shops, restaurants and hotels.  Poor or rich, all are at risk, as the Pulianthope slaughterhouse supplies meat to almost the entire city.  It slaughters about 2,000 goats on weekdays and nearly 6,000 on Sundays. 
While corporation veterinarians have been appointed for daily inspection at the abattoir, they are rarely to be seen, say butchers.  Under corporation norms, one veterinarian is required to be on duty for every 500 goats slaughtered. While slaughter begins as early as midnight on Sundays, it starts around 4am on weekdays. 
Goats procured from as far as Rajasthan, after days of transit, are offloaded from trucks into the abattoir pen. They are led into the slaughterhouse early morning in herds; they are killed and piled on top of another.  The cruel treatment is unavoidable as the slaughterhouse is not large enough to handle the city's meat supply , remarks a butcher. 
Overcrowding inside the abattoir, which compounds risk of infection, has led corporation authorities to remove a part of the roof of the hall.  With monsoon expected in a month, the corporation officials said they are working on putting fixing the roof and installing an industrial ventilation system. 
Outside the slaughter hall, illegal vendors sell meat fat and other animal organs.  "" A lot of these vendors sell discarded sick animal parts,â said a butcher.  This practice poses risks as carcasses are loaded onto vehicles just a few feet away.  Corporation officials had assured these vendors would be regulated, but to no avail. 
Butchers at the abattoir have been demanding extension of the 30,000 sqft facility.  "" A 10,000 sqft space lies vacant next door.  We hope the authorities will allow us to use it. "" 
With no proper drainage system, the abattoir is overrun with blood and animal waste. 
"" The effluents are channelled to the Kodungaiyur treatment plant where they are cleared before they are let out into the environment,â a corporation official said. 
The temporary slaughterhouse was erected four months ago as the modern abattoir failed to open as planned.  About 1,000 butchers feared they would lose their employment with the opening of the new mechanised slaughterhouse. 
General secretary of the city's Mutton Merchants' Association, Moolakadai Anshu said, "" What we want is an abattoir in all 15 zones.  This will lessen the load as smaller abattoirs will be easier to monitor. With lesser animals to screen, it will enable a more sanitary approach.  We have been making this demand to the corporation, but they haven't paid any heed to us. ""  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Respite ahead for Velachery, tenders out for twin flyovers  CHENNAI: The Velachery-Vijayanagar junction — which comes to a standstill during peak hours as commuters from Taramani, Tambaram, Guindy and GST Road converge — could have streamlined traffic if the state highways department’s plan to construct twin flyovers at the major crossing falls in place.  The department has floated tenders to build twin-flyovers that will cross over the busy junction. 
Estimated to cost around 73 crore, the flyovers will give a smooth passage to commuters on Velachery Main Road, Velachery Bypass Road, Taramani Link Road and GST Road. 
One flyover will start on Velachery Bypass Road and end near Velachery MRTS station.  The other will connect Taramani Link Road to the bypass road.  It will go over the first one at a height of 13m at the junction.  Both flyovers will have two lanes and will be unidirectional.  “The flyovers will end on either side of the median on Velachery Bypass Road,” said an engineer from the metro wing of the department. 
For those residing in Velachery, the project could ensure less congestion.  “Traffic is clogged for most parts of the day.  During rush hours, it takes at least half an hour to cross the junction,” said V K U Udayavel a graphic animator residing in Velachery. 
Government wants contractors to complete the work in 33 months.  Bids will be accepted till August 12.  “Though we have quoted 73 crore for the project, contractors always ask for 20-30% more.  This has to be scrutinised before money is released,” said the engineer.  “This will take at least a month,” he added. 
Following delays that are now plaguing flyovers at Moolakadai, Thirumangalam and Porur, it has been decided that construction will start only after acquiring land.  “We have acquired about 50% of the land.  The rest are in the final stages.  We are confident that full acquisition will be complete before construction,” said the engineer.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Metro rail looks north, west  The expansion of metro rail is expected to get a move-on with surveys set to begin for a Detailed Project Report (DPR) on three new lines under phase II that is aimed at linking the northern and western suburbs to the city's south. 
Public sector engineering consultancy firm Rites has been identified for preparing the report and the contract will be awarded in a day or two, said senior Chennai Metro Rail Ltd (CMRL) official on Thursday . “They can start work in two weeks.  The exercise is expected to take six to eight months. “ A tender to identify a company for the work was floated early this year. 
After an initial study on the traffic pattern, need for connectivity and feasibility for construction, the state government identified the Madhavaram-Light House (17km), Koyambedu-Injambakkam (27km) and Madhavaram-Perumbakkam (32km) corridors under the second phase.  When complete, the metro rail network will be spread over 121km, while the ideal size is 200km.  “After the report is ready , it will be submitted to the state government for approval and then referred to the Union ministry for sanctioning of funds,“ he added. 
The report will look at the topography and geotechnical details, including soil condition, layout of stations, alignment of the line, requirement of land and suggestion for intermodal connection between metro and other modes of transport, train operation plan and financial features.  Contractors will take up construction based on the inputs provided. 
Sources said CMRL was going ahead with the expansion plan despite phase I work being mired in delays.  “It is high time phase II is also sanctioned because the city should have had an extensive network of metro lines by now going by the population growth and the number of vehicles on the streets,“ said an official. 
The proposal to extend metro rail line from Washermenpet to Thiruvottiyur is yet to be cleared for funding.  “A DPR was prepared and the state govern ment approved it two years ago.  But, we cannot take it forward till the Union ministry gives clearance for funding pattern.  The work will be taken up as extension of phase I which is being constructed,“ he added. 
The initial idea was to study three corridors totalling 63km -Moolakadai to Thiruvanmiyur via Perambur, Thousand Lights and Mylapore; Moolakadai to Thirumangalam via Ambattur and Mogappair; and Mylapore to Poonamallee via Iyyappanthangal -under phase II.

Metro slows down Tirumangalam flyover work  CHENNAI: Tirumangalam flyover, which has been in construction since 2011, may be delayed by another two months.  Officials from the metro wing of the state highways department say that the tunneling work under one of the flyoverâs ramps has slowed the progress of the work.  The flyover was scheduled to open this month. 
The Rs60crore flyover being built as part of Inner Ring Road and will go over the junction of Anna Nagar 2nd Avenue and Mogappair Road.  The flyover will make commute easier for residents of Koyambedu, Ambattur, Red Hills and Avadi. 
Each flyover has two ramps - the portion before the pillars of the flyover start â that are heavy and engineers are careful on how much pressure it exerts on the ground as metro railâs tunnel is just 9m below the surface.  âThe ramp at the Anna Nagar end of the flyover is right above the tunnel.  We have kept load cells which record the weight of the structure,â said an engineer.  âFor every one metre addition of the structure, we have to wait for up to 15 days for the weight to dissipate before we can continue work,â said a highways engineer.  The department is getting technical support and advice from IIT-Madras. 
Engineers earlier expected the construction to be completed by July, but 2.4m of construction is still left.  âWe placed the load cells on January 2,â said the engineer.  When completed, it will be the first flyover by the metro wing of the state highways department.  Gemini flyover and the ones at Kathapara and Maduravoyal were built by the National Highways Authority of India before they were handed over to the state for maintenance.  The smaller flyovers are all built by Corporation of Chennai. 
The rest of the work has almost been completed.  âWe have finished constructing all the pillars and some 90% of the work is complete,â said the engineer. 
The flyover was proposed in 2010.  Construction began a year later and the deadline kept shifting due to numerous delays since the first deadline of March 2013.  Some of the issues that caused the delays are land acquisition â for which Rs19 crore of the total budget of Rs 60 crore was spent â and shifting of underground utilities like Metrowater pipes and TNEB lines. 
Commuters hope the flyover is completed before the onset of north-east monsoon which usually sets in around October 20.  âAs it is, it takes about 15minutes to cover 1km from Koyambedu flyover to Shanti Colony.  When it rains, it gets worse.  Hope the flyover is completed and opened before that,â said M R Udaya, a resident of Maduravoyal. 
More flyovers are under construction at Porur, Moolakadai and Anna Nagar.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  MTC told to pay Rs 8 lakh after man slips and dies while boarding bus  CHENNAI: More than two years after a passenger died because of a bus driver's rash and negligent driving, a motor accident claims tribunal here has slapped the managing director of Metropolitan Transport Corporation with a fine of Rs 8 lakh. 
Sekar died in an accident while boarding a bus at Moolakadai junction near Mahavaram on December 6, 2012.  According to the petition filed by his family, the driver started the bus before ensuring that all the passengers had boarded the vehicle.  Because of the sudden movement, Sekar fell down from the bus and came under its wheels.  He died on the way to hospital.  As the death occurred solely because of the rash and negligent driving of the bus driver, the MTC was liable to pay compensation, the petition said. 
Denying the arguments, MTC said Sekar was trying to board a running bus.  Despite being warned by the conductor and other passengers, he continued to run along the bus.  Suddenly, he slipped near a pit and sustained fatal injuries, MTC said, adding that Sekar himself was responsible for the accident and, it was not liable to pay compensation. 
Sub-judge J Chandran said according to a witness, who narrated the sequence of events in the court, the accident occurred because of rash and negligent driving of the bus driver.  There was nothing before the court to doubt "" credibility of the evidence"" , the judge said, and pointed out that GNT Road traffic investigation wing police had registered a case against the bus driver under Section 279 (driving on a public way so rashly or negligently to endanger human life) and 304 (A) (causing death by rash and negligent act) of the IPC. 
He said the driver and the bus conductor were not examined before the court. 
The judge said the accident could have been averted had the driver drove the bus in a slow and cautious manner.  Being the administrative head of the MTC, its managing director was liable to pay compensation, the court said.  Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.  Auto driver, 3 ‘passengers’ rob man in Madhavaram  CHENNAI: An autorickshaw driver and his three associates robbed a 26-year-old crane operator of Rs 1,500 in cash and a mobile phone worth Rs 15,000 at Moolakadai near Madhavaram on Friday night, police said.  The gang later pushed the victim out near an arts and science college on Madhavaram-Red Hills High Road and sped away. 
M Naresh of Kannappar Samy Nagar near Puzhal, who suffered injuries to the hand in the incident, walked about 1 km to the Madhavaram police station and lodged a complaint.  A case was registered and team of police personnel took Naresh in their vehicle from Moolakadai to Puzhal and nearby areas to trace the suspects but failed. 
Naresh told police that the incident occurred when he was returning home from work.  He saw an autorickshaw parked near the Moolakadai junction on Madhavaram-Red Hills High Road and approached it.  When he mentioned his destination, he was asked to get in.  “I saw a man sitting next to the driver and two others on the back seat.  One of them on the back seat got down and after I got in, he sat next to me,” he was quoted as saying. 
Soon after the journey began, Naresh told police, the two men sitting next to him landed a couple of blows on his face and he lost memory.  When he came to, the auto was passing by the Madhavaram police station but they held him tight and continued their attack.  Around 11pm, after snatching his cash and phone, they pushed him down on the road near Kanagachathiram Nagar and fled, he said. 
On Thursday, Manikandan of Mathur-MMDA was returning home in an auto when he was robbed of Rs 2,000 and four grams of gold jewellery near Koyambedu by a gang that adopted a modus operandi similar to the one a gang used to rob Naresh was on Friday. 
In an incident on December 3, 2012, Mallika of Mathur-MMDA, wife of retired sub-inspector Sadasivam, was kidnapped and murdered for her gold jewellery when the 50-year-old woman was returning home in a share autorickshaw from the Koyambedu bus terminus.  The killers dumped her body in the Vadaperumbakkam lake and escaped.  Police solved the case by arresting autorickshaw driver Venkatesan, 33, of Kodungaiyur, Parthiban, 26, a Tasmac employee, and Sudhakar, a tanker driver.

'Whichever party wins in 2016, it'll have a tough time'  DMK spokesman T K S Elangovan, in a freewheeling interview to TOI, opened up on a range of issues including coalition possibilities, family rule, the state of Tamil Nadu's economy, and the effect of a possible third front on DMK's prospects in the forthcoming assembly elections.  Excerpts:DMK appears to be reaching out to DMDK.  Are you in talks with Vijayakanth's party for an alliance? Last time we sought DMDK's support was before the 2013 Rajya Sabha elections when I met L K Sudheesh to get his party MLAs' votes for Kanimozhi.  They didn't support us thenâ¦we are not looking for too many allies now.  We may approach Left parties as they are a natural choice.  We will be comfortable working with Left parties, Congress, DMDK and MDMK, but we haven't talked to anyone so far.  PMK is trying to shed its casteist image and project Anbumani as a leader of the youth.  Won't PMK pose a threat to DMK's chances? PMK has attacked non-Vanniyars for over 25 years.  They can''t shed their Vanniyar tag.  They unleashed violence against other groups in Villupuram recently.  What are the major issues confronting the state? Whichever party comes to power in 2016, it will have a tough time.  Finances are in a poor shape as public debt has mounted to Rs 4 lakh crore.  And with our promise to impose prohibition, it will make things more difficult.  There is unemployment.  Every section of society, be it weavers, realtors, construction workers or farmers, has problems.  How is the agricultural sector doing? For the fourth successive year, owing to water shortage, most farmers have not been able to carry out cultivation of the short-term Kuruvai crop.  We toured nine districts and interacted with farmers.  All of them complained of poor maintenance and lack of desilting of water bodies.  But hasn't the agricultural output gone up in the last couple of years?
I don't think so.  How was it under DMK? When Kalaignar was the chief minister, without making much noise, he used to send emissaries to meet the Karnataka CM to get water released from Cauvery.  Karnataka used to oblige till it gained political overtones. 
What are the main poll issues for 2016? Lack of livelihood is the biggest issue.  Isn't corruption an issue? But given DMK's own record, you would not be in a position to talk about it, would you? Corruption is an issue and DMK can talk about the inaction due to corruption.  Government has failed to implement a single infrastructure project or attract a single industry.  Three flyover projects in North Chennai, - at Vyasarpadi, Moolakadai and Ennore - started in 2010 when I was an MP, they have not yet been completed though no land acquisition is involved.  Instead of completing infrastructure projects, Chennai Corporation is wasting time and money on constructing Amma theatres.  Port-Maduravoyal elevated road work is stuckâ¦power is available in the state because we purchase more than 3,300 MW from private suppliers at rates higher than our generation cost.  As a result, our power bills have gone upâ¦crimes have also gone up in recent years.  Many go unreported as police refuse to register complaints.  But opposition is in a state of disarray? Does DMK stand a chance without strong allies? We expect a share of AIADMK vote bank to shift loyalties to DMK.  We are also confident of roping in some alliance partners.  Won't formation of a third front hamper DMK's chances more? DMK suffered losses in 2014 Lok Sabha elections because of the third front.  But now BJP has lost its base, people have come to know that the Modi government is full of promises and no action.  There won't be a strong third front in the coming elections.  Will DMK field A Raja, Kanimozhi and Maran, who are accused of corruption, as campaigners? If we keep them away, it would mean that we admit they are guilty.  When we know they have not done anything wrong, why should we isolate them? Within the party we had this debate.  CAG's assessment of Rs 1.76 lakh crore loss in 2G is a myth.  Moreover, Raja attracts crowds wherever he goes.  If 2G verdict comes before the polls, it will help us.  Has promotion of Karunanidhi's family in the party and government affected the party's image? Family members of many DMK leaders including V R Nedumchezhian, K Anbazhagan and K A Mathiazhagan were legislators.  I was also groomed by my father.  DMK is full of people who have come from families who are aligned to the ideology.  Stalin has risen from the ranks.  He has been involved in political activity since 1969.  He was arrested during Emergency.  Alagiri and Kanimozhi, of course, are later entrants.  What do you think of TNCC president E V K S Elangovan's leadership? Elangovan is keeping the Congress alive in Tamil Nadu.  It is a marginalized force in the state, but it has the capacity to return to power at the Centre.

Man hires goons to kidnap wife’s boyfriend, 2 held  CHENNAI: Police on Friday arrested two of three men hired by a man employed in Saudi Arabia to kidnap his wife’s boyfriend in Chennai.  The case came to light when the abducted man, S Karthik of Madhavaram, managed to flee from his tormentors and lodged a complaint.  The Madhavaram police registered a case and are looking for two more men, including Sultan who ordered the kidnapping. 
A court has remanded the arrested men, P Ravi alias Ravikumar, 24, of Thiruchengode in Namakkal district and K Appu alias Vikramadityan, 25, of Red Hills, in judicial custody. 
Police said Sultan worked as a civil engineer in Saudi Arabia, while his wife Fathima* lived in Madhavaram.  A year ago, she approached Karthik, who worked with a private mobile service provider, in connection with a SIM card.  Soon, the two began a relationship and often met at her house.  However, Fathima broke off the relationship when Karthik, a resident of Natesan Nagar in Madhavaram, began insisting that she divorce her husband Sultan and marry him. 
Meanwhile, Sultan learned of the intimacy between Karthik and his wife and decided to kidnap Karthik.  He hired Ravi, Appu and Mahesh for the job.  The three men, however, met Karthik and struck another deal to reunite him with Fathima.  Karthik agreed and promised to pay them Rs 5 lakh. 
The gang members called him for a few rounds of talks where they suggested that they would kidnap the woman when she was walking on the road and cruise along slowly so that Karthik could intervene and rescue her.  This would definitely impress the woman and he could regain her confidence, they said.  The gang suggested they conduct a recce before the actual kidnap and told him to hire an SUV. 
A few days ago, the four of them went on a trip to Moolakadai when the gang members changed direction and headed towards Guindy.  The men told Karthik that they had kidnapped him as ordered by Sultan as he promised them a larger sum. 
As the SUV was on the Kathipara flyover in Guindy, Karthik grabbed at the steering.  The driver, later revealed as Appu, lost control and the vehicle hit a two-wheeler.  The biker and other passersby blocked the car and dragged Appu out. 
Taking advantage of the melee, Karthik got out and cried for help.  While the others managed to flee, Appu was handed over to the Guindy police and later handed over to the Madhavaram police.  Based on the information provided by Appu, police nabbed Ravi and the two were arrested on Friday.

t.  Mathias Church, Kamarajar Salai, Luz, Mylapore, 7 p. m.  Inching forward Flyovers at two key locations in the city –Thirumangalam and Moolakadai — are expected to be completed by October.  Motorists and pedestrians using these junctions are eagerly awaiting the completion of these facilities that will help reduce congestion. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At Thirumangalam, work on the remaining ramp on the Koyambedu side is progressing well, weight slowly and watching how it settles.  Since the tunnel is at a depth of nine metres, we are unable to take the foundation to the hard rock surface underground and so, the load has to be dissipated within four metres from the surface.  We are measuring the settlement using pressure gauges at various levels,” explained a source. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
V.  Rajagopal, a resident of Anna Nagar, should be changed suitably once the flyover is completed.  “There are just too many one-ways in the Anna Nagar area due to metro rail and this work.  Residents have been waiting for the project to be completed at the earliest,” he said. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The work on the flyover was held up for some time due to delays in traffic diversions and also due to a design change. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delays plagued the flyover at Moolakadai that is coming up at the junction of Madhavaram High Road and GNT Road too.  Permission for traffic diversion and delay in land acquisition forced the department to slow down work.  “The main structural work is expected to be completed by September and we will require one more month for the miscellaneous works,” said a source. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aranmanaivasal,"Respect sentiments of people: DMK A large number of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) volunteers, including women, staged demonstrations at the headquarters here and Sivaganga, demanding that the government impose total prohibition, heeding to the public outcry. 
Former Ministers Suba Thangavelan, V.  Sathyamoorthy, former MP Bavani Rajendran and former MLAs Murugavel and Thisaiveerran took part in the agitation organised in front of Aranmanai here as part of the party’s State-wide agitation, demanding total prohibition in the State. 
District secretary Suba Tha Divakaran led the agitation, in which a large number of women participated and raised slogans against the State government and demanding the immediate closure of the liquor ships.  Addressing the stir, Mr Divakaran said the State government should respect the sentiments of the people, especially the womenfolk and close down the liquor shops. 
At Aranmanaivasal in Sivaganga, DMK district secretary and former Minister K. R.  Periya Karuppan led the agitation.  Former Minister M.  Thennavan and DMK office-bearers joined the agitation and shouted slogans against the government for maintaining a stoic silence on the issue even after the death of ‘Gandhian’ Sasi Perumal, who had been fighting for prohibition. 
Before staging the demonstration, the DMK volunteers observed silence for a minute as a mark of respect to Sasi Perumal and conveyed their condolences to the bereaved family.

Despite a series of agitations against Tasmac outlets being staged across the State, the State government has not made any clarification on the issue, according to DMK’s deputy general secretary, I.  Periasamy. 
Addressing a meeting organised by the party demanding implementation of total prohibition in the State here on Monday, Mr.  Periasamy said that unlike the previous DMK Government that worked for the people, the present government did not bother about the common man.  “The DMK government worked for the welfare of women in particular.  But, now, the people are shocked to see separate rooms set up in bus stands for the benefit of lactating mothers, very near liquor shops,” he said. 
Stating that the people of the State have now realised that the DMK president would fulfil all his promises, he said that former Chief Minister M.  Karunanidhi would keep his words of implementing total prohibition on coming back to power in the State. 
The cadres, including district secretaries, A.  Chakrapani (West) and P.  Senthilkumar (East), took part in the agitations.

Padmavathy Street,"Kidnapped boy rescued by police A boy who was kidnapped for ransom while on his way home from school on Thursday was rescued in a covert operation by police on Friday night.  The alleged kidnapper, an engineering graduate, has been apprehended. 
Police sources said the boy Arvind Raj, a class VI student of a private school on Padmavathy Street in Madanandapuram near Porur, did not return from school on Thursday afternoon.  “Around 4 p. m.  on Thursday I got a call on my cellphone from a man who claimed he had kidnapped my son and demanded a ransom of Rs.  50 lakh for his release.  Shocked on hearing this, I informed my husband and we soon approached the city police,” Suganthi (37), the boy’s mother recalled the agonising moments at a press conference at the Commissionerate on Saturday.  The kidnapper had obtained Suganthi’s number from her son after taking him away in his car as he was walking to his house. 
Suganthi and husband Balaji, an L&T employee here, approached Commissioner of Police S.  George, who formed 16 special teams lead by two Additional Commissioners, to rescue the child.  “We tutored the mother to respond to the kidnapper and she did a good job by convincing him on giving him Rs.1.5 lakh for the safe return of her child,” said an investigating officer. 
Suganthi took a train to the Avadi railway station on Friday evening and finally reached a bridge near Pattabiram.  When an unidentified man approached the mother to take the money, the police team that was providing cover, swooped in on the suspect. 
He was identified as Bala alias Balamahendran (26), a resident of Brindavan Nagar, Avadi, who is unemployed. 
Arvind Raj was seated in Bala’s car that was parked near a bridge close to the Hindu College railway station.  He was reunited with his parents around 9 p. m.  on Friday.
